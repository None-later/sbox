                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19694666">Meet the Press</a> featured a debate between Senators Graham and Webb on the Iraq War.  Jim Webb was great and it’s no surprise that Senator Graham played the role of Karl Rove’s stooge.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/07/15/webb-v-graham">Faiz</a> does a nice job of where this debate get a little heated – including Graham’s <a href="http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news/politics.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-12-0061.html">charge</a> that Senator’s Webb was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This would be the greatest politicization of military action in the history of the country&#8221; if Congress stepped in to set troop-rotation rules, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said … &#8220;I think the best thing we could do for our troops is let&#8217;em win,&#8221; Graham retorted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought the greatest politicization of military action was that decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq so that Bush-Cheney would win the 2004 election.  But let’s review some of the highlights of Graham’s appearance to see if he has any earthly clue what “win” even means.  After a lot of hot air about some global war “supporting a form of moderation not known to the Mideast” where this surge is supposed to defeat Al Qaeda and Iran at the same time, Lindsey suggests that we Democrats advocate “making a mistake for the ages”.  No Senator – before March 19, 2003, neither Al Qaeda nor Iran were that powerful.  The mistake of the ages was made on March 19, 2003 and you supported it.  But here is Senator Graham painting the surge as working:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as the stress of the military, it has been an enormously difficult war. And I was in Baghdad on July the Fourth of this year.  We had the highest re-enlistment &#8211; the largest re-enlistment ceremony in a wartime environment known to our country.  The one thing I can tell you about our troops, they are doing things we’ve never done before, because there’s more of them.  The surge is producing results.  The biggest result from these brave men and women’s new effort is that the Sunnis who’ve tasted al-Qaeda’s life in the Sunni part of Iraq, Anbar province &#8211; when he was running for the Senate, it was declared lost.  Well, it has, it has been recaptured.  And the people living in Anbar have chosen to align themselves with us, because al-Qaeda overplayed their hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s odd as it was these Sunnis who we decided to kick out of power four years ago.  Maybe that’s why the Shia government is not all that happy that US forces have aligned with these Sunnis.  Something else is odd – if both the Shias and the Sunnis hate Al Qaeda, then why is this White House and Senator Graham saying that if we leave, Osama bin Laden takes reign of the Iraqi government?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Because it’s in our national security interest to make sure that al-Qaeda does not have a safe haven &#8230; General Petraeus says the number one enemy of America is al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Lee Hamilton in December said that our chief national security interest, in a sense, is al-Qaeda in Iraq. Let me tell you why we have to beat al-Qaeda in Iraq before anything else falls into place.  Number one, they’re an extremist group that have come to this country, Iraq, to destroy this effort at democracy.  And they were able to thrive under the old strategy.  They were able to occupy a territory in Anbar province.</p></blockquote>
<p>Look if we leave Iraq, Al Qaeda will have no friends there.  I suspect that they’ll find a way to sneak out the back door so as to avoid being slaughtered in an Iraqi civil war.  But if they can spook stupid American politicians like George W. Bush and Lindsey Graham into keeping our boots on the ground occupying a Muslim nation, they are winning and we are losing.  Is Lindsey Graham so stupid not to realize this – or is he as Jim Webb suggests just another rightwing political hack?  Either way – Americans would be fools to listen to him. </p>
<p>Of course, the real winner during the Senator&#8217;s &#8220;performance&#8221; was his repeating the two weeks line as in this strategy has been in place for only two weeks with enormous success.  Let&#8217;s recall that the timing of the Iraq invasion was on Bush&#8217;s own choosing and that we 52 months ago.  So what does the Senator thinks our soldiers were doing for the first 2600 weeks of this war &#8211; twiddling their thumbs?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200707150002">Media Matters</a> goes further down in the MTP show to find Robert Novak acting a bit sexist and racist at the same time:</p>
<blockquote><p>NOVAK: A lot of people don&#8217;t want him back, though, for a third term. And I think it&#8217;s very dangerous to call this a third term of Bill Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh wow – Hillary will just step back and let her man do her job?  Novak continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans are very pessimistic about 2008. When you talk to them off the record, they don&#8217;t see how they can win this thing. And then they think for a minute, and only the Democratic Party, with everything in their favor, would say that, &#8220;OK, this is the year either to have a woman or an African-American to break precedent, to do things the country has never done before.&#8221; And it gives the Republicans hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh Lordy mercy!  Can’t have a black man or some woman leading this country!  Of course, the number three candidate in our party is a white male.  But then John Edwards is one of those TRIAL LAWYERS, which makes Novak really go batty.  As Media Matters noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Neither host Tim Russert nor any of Novak&#8217;s fellow panelists, Bloomberg News Washington managing editor Al Hunt, Republican strategist Mike Murphy, and Democratic strategist Bob Shrum &#8211; all of whom are, like Novak, white men &#8211; commented on or challenged Novak&#8217;s assertion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that when Jim Webb dressed down Lindsey Graham – that was the highlight of the show.  I’m glad I had to leave right after their interview.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/caccianli-i-cie.html">Brad DeLong</a> for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Personally I see no need to omit Norway. I do see a need to plot the Norway point on the graph correctly. The revenues plotted on the vertical scale include oil excise taxes levied on corporations. The tax rates plotted on the horizontal scale do not&#8211;hence the Norway &#8220;tax rate&#8221; of 28% rather than the correct 52%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  Yes &#8211; <a href="http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Norway-TAXATION.html">really</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Corporate income taxes are levied at a flat rate of 28% (a combination of 21.25% national tax, and 6.75% municipal tax). Also, employers contribute up to 16.7% of paid wages to the Social Security Scheme. Companies involved in oil or gas pay a special oil tax of 50% in addition to the standard 28%. All income from capital is taxable at 28%, except dividends, which are taxed at 11%.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a specific example of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/effective-corporate-tax-rates-for.html">my general point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other thing is the comparison of C corporate profit taxes to GDP when corporate profits are not the only form of capital income. In 2006, US C corporate profits represented only 12.2% of US GDP but the share of capital income to GDP was much higher as there are several forms of capital income. And yes, interest income and S corporate profits are taxed – just differently. Our post had considered two aspects of the right-hand side variables: (1) are we measuring tax rates appropriately; and (2) are they other factors driving capital income and taxes from such income (such as oil revenues)? But the real issue is whether we should put any stock in looking at a subset of capital income when making cross-national comparisons?</p></blockquote>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2007_07_08_chronArchive.asp#7537668908152803874">Donald Luskin</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118428874152665452.html?mod=opinion&#038;ojcontent=otep">WSJ oped crew</a> tried to make a case for the Laffer curve that depended critically on the Norway data point – one would think they would have gotten this key data point correct.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/printer_1000article_10007581.shtml">This source</a> compares total taxes as a share of GDP across the OECD nations and this U.S. comes out at the lower end.  OK, Korea and Mexico have lower tax burdens but these two nations aren’t exactly beating us in per capita GDP.  Table B shows taxes on income and corporate profits and the source provides some interesting details including this one on Ireland:</p>
<blockquote><p>Table A shows that in 2005, Irish taxation as a percentage of GDP was 30.5% compared with 32.5% in 1995. However, because GDP includes the output of the multinational sector, which is very significant in Ireland (almost 90% of Irish exports are made by foreign-owned firms), it is more useful to use Gross National Product &#8211; the total value of final goods and services produced in a country plus income from Irish capital held abroad set-off against transfers of net earnings of multinationals &#8211; in effect net income outflows from Ireland. In Other OECD countries, there is only a marginal difference between GDP and GNP. We can see from Table C that the Irish tax burden has changed little since 1995. While personal taxes have fallen, indirect or stealth taxes have risen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I offer this as AB reader Sammy has been spewing some Celtic Tiger mythology here with checking out what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irish-economic-miracle-and-tax-policy.html">we wrote</a> way back when.  I have to admit I found this when Googling to see how Brad came up with the suggestion that the effective corporate tax rate in Norway was 52%.  If the tax rate on oil profits was 78% and the tax rate on other profits was 28%, the weighted average would be 52% only if oil profits were 48% of the total.  But it seems oil does represent 25% of GDP so this assumption about oil profits as a share of total profits being 48% is plausible.  After all, the share of value-added accruing to profits for the oil sector are likely quite high relative to the shares in the other sectors of Norway’s economy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Greg&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;only&#8221; in the sentence &#8220;The poorest fifth of the population, with average annual income of $15,400, pays only 4.5 percent&#8221; makes it seem as though he does not consider that amount to be much of a burden to the poor, not like a rich taxpayer who &#8220;forks-over&#8221; 31.1 percent of their income which seems to imply much more hardship. But remember, &#8220;Fairness is not an economic concept.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark continues by reminding us of his essay from a couple of years ago.  But I have a couple of other objections to what Greg wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The C.B.O.’s most recent calculations of federal tax rates show a highly progressive system. (The numbers are based on 2004 data, but the tax code has not changed much since then.) &#8230; A question for any political candidate today is whether he or she agrees with the Bush tax ceiling. If not, how high above a third is he or she willing to go?</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Greg left out two important items.  By focusing on Federal taxes, he has omitted state and local taxes.  Most people do pay these.  And by looking at 2004, he is forgetting that the budget is not exactly in balance.  Yes, the General Fund deficit was rather large so current tax obligations do not capture the cost of government as in all those deferred tax bills thanks to the Bush tax “cuts”.  </p>
<p>But one might try <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/current-fiscal-picture.html">Greg did</a> that the unified deficit is not that large:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 1.5% of GDP, this year&#8217;s deficit is well below the 40-year average of 2.4% of GDP &#8230; Of course, there is still a looming long-run fiscal gap. The short-run fiscal picture, however, does not look historically anomalous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg leaves out the fact that we have a large Social Security surplus, which is the reason why he can argue that the “deficit” is not that large.  Implicit in the use of this figure is the proposition that those payroll “contributions” we are making are NOT to become our retirement benefits down the road.  As long as we are posing questions for political candidates, let’s pose this one for Mitt Romney (as Greg is one of his advisors): do you intend to slash Social Security benefits in the future as you continue to impose these employment taxes?  After all, you want to maintain the Bush tax “cuts” and still have a large defense department.</p>

<p>The latest nonsense from the WSJ on the alleged <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118428874152665452.html?mod=opinion&#038;ojcontent=otep">Laffer curve</a> apparently also irked Bruce Bartlett who emailed me an OECD document of tax rates in various nations from 2000 to 2006.  I think Bruce was hoping someone could do a proper regression – but note <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003185.html">Max</a> is having way too much fun with these regressions.  I decided to graph the changes in the alleged tax rates for Canada, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, and the US (my selection of nations to include was sort of arbitrary but there will be a point in a moment).  </p>
<p>One may take from the graph that other nations are lowering their corporate tax rates but ours is stuck at 39.3%.  Canada’s was 44.6% in 2000 but it was only 36.1% in 2006.  Mexico’s was 35% in 2000 but it was only 32% in 2000.  Even high tax Japan has dropped its rate to 39.5%, and yet ours is at 39.3%. So the OECD seems to suggest.  But there seem to be several things missing here.</p>
<p>First – if you are wondering why the US rate is 39.3% rather than 35% &#8211; think state income taxes.  Of course, US corporations often don’t pay a 4.3% effective state tax rate as tax planning plays such as Delaware Intangible Holding Companies (can your say transfer pricing) allow opportunities to lower this effective tax rate.  At the Federal level, US corporations used to have that FISC/EIE game and now have a Section 199 game.  So if you tax director has you stuck with a 39.3% effective tax rate – fire him now.  </p>
<p>That Swiss rate of 21.3% might look low but it is not as low as the 12.5% Irish rate.  So why are so many US based companies shifting intangible profits to Switzerland rather than Ireland?  Could it be that the Swiss Federal rate is only 8.5%?  The alleged 21.3% rate contains a high local government rate.  Only thing is that a lot of companies are located in the Swiss equivalent of Delaware.  </p>
<p>Also note that the Mexican corporate profits tax is lower than the US rate.  So why do many companies try to source more income in the US and less in Mexico (can you say transfer pricing again).  It seems that the Mexican government imposes a tax on profits to pay for their version of Social Security.  </p>
<p>The WSJ’s amateurish graphs and all the regressions in the world are not that impressive unless one addresses two matters.  The first matter is the above concern regarding measuring effective tax rates.  But I think that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/06/trompe_loeil.cfm">The Economist</a> hinted at a more important concern a while back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why, no, there isn&#8217;t.  You could also choose to have enormous deposits of oil and natural gas! Seriously, I don&#8217;t understand how anyone is making that argument from that graph.  Throwing out Norway, where high GDP is due to fossil fuel reserves that cannot be achieved through any policy decision, there seems to be a downward sloping, although noisy, curve running from America and Ireland through Canada and the higher-spending European countries.  Even if you throw out America &#8211; even if you throw out Ireland &#8211; the relationship is pretty clear.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comment was directed at something <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/social-spending.html">Mark Thoma</a> wrote but if we toss out Norway as an outlier that has an alternative explanation of high tax revenues as a share of GDP.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_07/011682.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes what happens when one tosses out this outlier:</p>
<blockquote><p>Norway, with a corporate tax rate of about 29%, generates enormous amounts of corporate tax revenue. But then, since it&#8217;s the only way to get an upside-down U out of the data, the graph goes nearly vertical. Even the Journal&#8217;s editorial writers, normally a pretty barefaced bunch, were apparently too embarrassed about this economic singularity to follow the right side of their graph to its logical conclusion, but we can: at a rate of about 33% corporate taxes produce no revenue at all. An increase of a mere four percentage points destroys tax revenue entirely! Mirabile dictu!  A junior high school geometry student would be embarrassed to produce work like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or may the WSJ is telling us that as soon of the effective tax rate drops just below 30%, we will find lots of oil in them thar hills &#8211; <a href="http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/beverly-hillbillies.htm">black gold, Texas tea</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  A couple of more points about this WSJ nonsense.  The following statement is not quite right:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of which means that the U.S. now has the unflattering distinction of having the developed world&#8217;s highest corporate tax rate of 39.3% (35% federal plus a state average of 4.3%), according to the Tax Foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>From what I have read from the Tax Foundation, they tend to agree with <a href="http://www.economist.com/countries/Japan/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The standard national corporate tax rate is 30%. Including local taxes, the effective standard corporate tax rate is 40.9%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless the WSJ oped writers do not consider Japan to be part of the developed world, their statement is false.  The other thing is the comparison of C corporate profit taxes to GDP when corporate profits are not the only form of capital income.  In 2006, US C corporate profits represented only 12.2% of US GDP but the share of capital income to GDP was much higher as there are several forms of capital income.  And yes, interest income and S corporate profits are taxed – just differently.  </p>
<p>Our post had considered two aspects of the right-hand side variables: (1) are we measuring tax rates appropriately; and (2) are they other factors driving capital income and taxes from such income (such as oil revenues)?  But the real issue is whether we should put any stock in looking at a subset of capital income when making cross-national comparisons?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: I need to point out that it was <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/yet-again-tax-c.html">Mark Thoma</a> who combined the Economist blog tossing out Norway to this supply-silliness and that the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/it-is-outlandis.html">Economist blog</a> is being unfair to Mark.</p>

<blockquote><p>the Laffer Curve works in the real world just as predicted by Laffer&#8217;s original axiom &#8211; and that the US is exactly in the wrong place on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luskin wrote this yesterday at 8:05 AM.  A few hours later, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/yet-again-tax-c.html">Mark Thoma</a> noted: </p>
<blockquote><p>The blue line is supposed to be the Laffer curve, but this is far from compelling. Since it looks like all that&#8217;s been done here is to draw a line through an outlier, Norway (an outlier that in other contexts we are told to ignore because it is an outlier, e.g. see below), and since this is clearly not the best fitting line to these data, here&#8217;s another possibility … I haven&#8217;t actually run the regression, but it looks clear to me that revenues rise with tax rates, and the fit also looks better than in the first graph. Toss out Norway, and the fit looks even better</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003184.html">Max Sawicky</a> calls the WSJ graph the dumbest thing he has ever seen and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>For fun I did a regression line for similar data (same year, same countries). I threw out those annoying communist outliers at the top (Luxembourg and Norway) &#8212; countries with high tax rates and revenues. (By the way, when you include them without forcing a zero intercept, there is no significant relationship between the corporate tax rate (combined, central and sub-central govs) and corp rev/GDP. Very slight negative relationship. Throw out the two outliers and the same non-result (insignificant positive relationship).</p></blockquote>
<p>That the Stupidest Man Alive fell for the dumbest thing Max has ever seen does not surprise <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/stupidest-man-a.html">Brad DeLong</a>.  Luskin says the Laffer curve works in “the real world”.  Does he have any clue what the real world actually is?</p>

                                <p>The post had to be heavily modified.  Every so often I make a mistake.  Its both a pro and con of trying to be open and transparent&#8230;  sometimes you get egg on your face, but at least you learn something.  Reader Spencer indicated there was a problem with Table 1.  So I redid it.  And there was an error.  Which caused me to change the rest of the post&#8230;  apologies</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>This post is on inflation and the real fed funds rate and how both moved over time, focusing in particular on the various Presidential administrations since Ike. The inflation is just the percentage change in the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a> &#8211; since the data is provided monthly, I elected to go from January to January, as that is the month in which new Presidents are inaugurated. The real fed funds rate is just the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Monthly/H15_FF_O.txt">Fed Funds Rate</a> (again, for January) less the rate of inflation for the year. </p>
<p>Now, it should be noted that the President does not control inflation or the Fed Funds rate – both are controlled by the Federal Reserve. That is not to say the Fed doesn’t react to what the President is doing… a President might in effect provoke the Fed into inflicting inflation on the economy by engaging in particularly silly fiscal policy. For example, if the President institutes a particularly inane set of tax cuts plus finds a way to drive up the deficit in a way virtually designed not to provide much fiscal stimulus, the Fed might be forced to react by making money very, very cheap for a long time. But enough about the GW administration… let’s look at the graphs.</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of the inflation..</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrGbCZtWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/2Tup3ces9Mc/s1600-h/inflation,+graph,+second+try.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrGbCZtWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/2Tup3ces9Mc/s320/inflation,+graph,+second+try.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpjfHLCZtVI/AAAAAAAAAbw/D7dW1mj9xxM/s1600-h/inflation,+table+2,+updated.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpjfHLCZtVI/AAAAAAAAAbw/D7dW1mj9xxM/s320/inflation,+table+2,+updated.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />updated comment</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had several people comment on this with questions.  Clearly I have done a poor job of explaining the series&#8230;. and apparently I truncated the table (relative to how I normally present it&#8230; I&#8217;ve expanded the table).  Apologies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal&#8230;  January to January when Ike took office was 0.38%.  When he left office it was 1.71%.  Thus, the Fed allowed inflation to increase by a relatively large amount from the time he started in his job to when he left.  This is not to say inflation was high&#8230; merely that it grew by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Sorry if this hasn&#8217;t been clear. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of the real fed funds rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrYbCZtXI/AAAAAAAAAcA/wHStr5FwlLY/s1600-h/ffr+graph,+second+try.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrYbCZtXI/AAAAAAAAAcA/wHStr5FwlLY/s320/ffr+graph,+second+try.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There’s no summary of the real fed funds rate… since it goes from positive to negative and vice versa in some terms, the percentage change is not a meaningful term. Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do we get from this?</p>
<p>So what happened under Nixon/Ford and GW? Well, in the former instance, the economy was in trouble with the oil embargo, and with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, the Fed found itself in waters that had been uncharted for a long time. Mistakes happen. With GW… the tax cuts in 2001 and 2002 and 2003 were not of the sort designed to provide any real fiscal stimulus after the slight downturn in March 2001, and as the downturn seemed to extend and extend (recall &#8211; GW likes to count changes from August of 2003), the Fed stepped in with a series of rate cuts.</p>
<p>Does any of this matter? Who knows? But a quick look at the correlation between inflation and real median income…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rpdn3rCZtPI/AAAAAAAAAbA/_U2mgAxXdmE/s1600-h/inflation+and+ffr,+table+3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rpdn3rCZtPI/AAAAAAAAAbA/_U2mgAxXdmE/s320/inflation+and+ffr,+table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As always, correlations are simplistic&#8230; ignoring the cross-effects of multiple factors but&#8230;. Inflation and percentage change in real median income are negatively correlated (-0.6). Inflation in any given year doesn’t seem to have a big effect on income the next year… but its possible with more granular data we can show that higher real median income actually affects the inflation rate. Now… recall from a post a while back that JFK/LBJ and Clinton were the two administrations during which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median grew the fastest</a>.  The JFK/LBJ median income growth is certainly surprising in this context.</p>
<p>I’ll try to do see how all this ties in with home ownership at some later point.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Another update&#8230;  this seems to be the most &#8220;everything that can go wrong will go wrong&#8221; post I&#8217;ve ever written.  Courtesy of reader dxc&#8230; the original graphs had no labels except 0s on the Y axis.  Its been corrected (I hope!).</p>

<blockquote><p>Tax revenue raised from penalties and taxes designed to discourage certain societal behaviour is problematic. Government has learned to rely upon these revenue streams in order to fund certain government activities (like law enforcement). This allows the toleration of some level of illegal, unhealthy and/or dangerous behaviour in society in order to fund government spending. Raising these taxes and penalties is therefore problematic as it both reduces a potential revenue stream while raising political issues with voters who see such rises as merely revenue raising. If this revenue is directed towards the central bank for money destruction, instead of government treasuries for spending, then these penalties can be raised with less political fallout.</p></blockquote>

<p>This blog has a lot of commentary on the US economy, most of it is pessimistic.  It is always interesting to read what our &#8220;competitors&#8221; in the world economy think about the US.  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/anatole_kaletsky/article2062059.ece">This </a> article is titled <em><strong>&#8220;Is the puny dollar a sign of America&#8217;s Decline?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, the pound and the euro hit their highest levels in a generation against the US dollar. The dollar, meanwhile, collapsed to a record low against an average of all the world&#8217;s major currencies. It is tempting to interpret the flight from the dollar in financial markets as the clearest, most objective, indicator of America&#8217;s relative decline.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Europe has long been derided as an ageing, sclerotic continent, doomed to irrelevance in a world dominated by America and Asia. But could it actually be America, not Europe, that is failing to compete in the globalised world economy and is now threatened with long-term decline?</p></blockquote>
<p>From this standard doom and gloom opening, the author Anatole Koletsky, (see bio with the article) comes to some non-standard conclusions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadly, for those of us who live in Britain and Europe and would like to believe that the strength of our currencies reflects our superlative economic prospects, the answer is an emphatic no. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;..since the deregulation of currencies and financial markets in the 1980s and 1990s, currency strength has conveyed almost no information about the health of a national economy and none at all about a country&#8217;s competitive position in global trade. For example, anyone who believes that the falling dollar reflects America&#8217;s huge trade deficit and foreign borrowing should consider that the one leading currency even weaker in the past three years than the dollar has been the yen; yet Japan has the world&#8217;s biggest trade surplus and is the greatest creditor nation the world has ever seen.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that any relationship has existed between currencies and economic performance, it has usually been the wrong way round rising currencies usually preceded periods of economic decline, while weakening currencies have presaged economic strength.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Americans, meanwhile, will enjoy the benefits of a super-cheap currency, which will more than offset falling property prices and problems with a small minority of mortgage loans. American politicians, for all their faults, instinctively understand this, which is why they have generally welcomed a falling dollar and have been pressuring China and Japan to let the dollar weaken against the yen and the renmimbi not just, as at present, against the euro and the pound</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating stuff.  Some good correlations that back up his contentions.  Remember this is a competitor.</p>
