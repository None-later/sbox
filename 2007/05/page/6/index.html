<blockquote><p>NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE/NSPD 51 </p>
<p>HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE/HSPD-20 </p>
<p>Subject: National Continuity Policy </p>
<p>Purpose </p>
<p>(1) This directive establishes a comprehensive national policy on the continuity of Federal Government structures and operations and a single National Continuity Coordinator responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of Federal continuity policies. This policy establishes &#8220;National Essential Functions,&#8221; prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies, and provides guidance for State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response to and recovery from a national emergency. </p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much to add to this. But I bet Bush&#8217;s 28% or 33% or whatever it is that won&#8217;t bat an eye at this will go nuts if a Democrat becomes President.</p>

                                <p>I’ve had a few posts comparing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">performance of various by presidential administration</a>.  This one will look at Real Median income (of people 15 years and older after 1980, 14 and older before that).  The graph below shows how real median income changed since Ike became President.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlJSOiSzD3I/AAAAAAAAAMg/eMKRTD1vlRk/s1600-h/real+median+income,+graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlJSOiSzD3I/AAAAAAAAAMg/eMKRTD1vlRk/s320/real+median+income,+graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The following table shows the annual percentage growth rate in real median income over each administration.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlJSXSSzD4I/AAAAAAAAAMo/SDy2fpjnEdI/s1600-h/real+median+income,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlJSXSSzD4I/AAAAAAAAAMo/SDy2fpjnEdI/s320/real+median+income,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The interesting thing about this series is the Carter administration&#8230; as noted in other posts, the economy itself grew relatively quickly in the Carter administration (relative, that is, to growth in Republican administrations), particularly when accounting for debt.  But during his administration, real median income performed worse than under any other administration.  I have no idea why, except to assume that the disparity in income must have grown quite a bit.  I guess that’s a topic for another post.</p>
<p>Leaving aside Carter, not unexpectedly (given the previous posts in this series) the two top performers were JFK/LBJ and Clinton.  The top performing Republican was Reagan (also not unexpectedly given the previous posts in this series), and three out of five Republican administrations saw decreases in real median income.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Administrative Note…</p>
<p>The real (2005) figures I used do not precisely match those on the Census site.  1974 – 2005 Real median income data from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">Table P-7</a> uses the CPI – R – US series to convert from nominal to 2005 data.  Data from 1947 to 1997 in <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p60-203.pdf">Table C-2 of Measuring 50 Years of Change</a> has been put into the 1997 base year using the CPI – U – X1 and CPI – U series.  Obviously, mixing and matching the two series would lead to error.  So I converted the 1947 to 1973 data to nominal (using data provided in Table C-1 of the Measuring 50 Years of Change report, and then used the latest CPI – U to develop real 2005 figures for both series.  I can appreciate the folks at the BLS always trying to improve the CPI series, but it took a couple hours just to figure out why the data wasn’t matching up in the years in which the two series overlapped.  (After the adjustment, of course, the nominal data in those years does match up.)  I note this would all be a lot easier if the Census just went ahead and reported data for longer periods on their Census.  </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Editorial Comment</p>
<p>I wonder how many of the folks that have insisted, with regards to posts on other series, that lags are the reason for Republicans doing worse than Democrats, are going to be willing to cut Jimmy Carter the same slack here?  Perhaps we should assume that what should be attributed to Carter are the four best consecutive years in the Reagan years?  And Carter’s dismal performance was due to Nixon?  I’m not willing to make that attribution – and my guess is that nobody in the “lags are the explanation” will either.</p>
<p>Which leads me to think… perhaps I should write a post on lags and their effects.  Look for that some time soon.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Correction.  Originally I had the wrong link to the Census report with data going back to 1947.  Apologies.</p>

                                <p>It is no secret I live in a region with too few jobs in total and too many low quality jobs.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been traveling through regions with much healthier economies.</p>
<p>I have background in construction (working and consulting) and hospitality (consulting), so I tend to notice activity in those industries.</p>
<p>No big surprise &#8211;  there is a worker shortage in prosperous areas, and that shortage is clearly being filled with undocumented workers, quite openly (I teach employment screening techniques to employers, so that is not hot air). They are by and large very hard working and very nice people (although someone needs to teach the hotel maids what “do not disturb” means especially when grandpa and grandma are well, you know…&#8230;.sleeping).</p>
<p>These questions come to mind:</p>
<p>1)      Is the mal-distribution of labor a justification for wide spread violation of the immigration, documentation and tax laws by workers and employers?</p>
<p>2)      Should the federal government be doing more about the mal-distribution, or is it just a market issue?</p>
<p>3)      Should the government be doing more about regional economies, as a cure for the mal-distribution?</p>
<p>This is timely due to the recent compromise on immigration reform.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week I had post summarizing results from a number of other posts in which I compared <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">how various series moved</a> by presidential administration. For example, I looked at how the economy, national debt, dollar valuation, and so forth grew under various administrations. But I also looked at some social issues, such as abortions, unwed motherhood, etc. In almost every series, Democratic Presidents did better than Republican Presidents.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got some comments and some correspondence from people who felt that Presidents can’t possibly be affecting some of these social issues. As more than one person asked – can one really believe that someone is less likely to get an abortion because Clinton is President than they are if GHW or GW is President? How can this possibly be? In other words, people feel that if the numbers who Democrats are doing better on social issues which drive Republican voters, it must be purely a coincidence.</p>
<p>My answer is – yes, it can be, and there are two transmission mechanisms I can think of that make it so. (To be honest, to me both of these transmission mechanisms seem fairly obvious &#8211; it took me a bit of time to realize there was any dispute about this.) The first such transmission mechanism is itself social. Democrats are more likely to favor sex education and funding for contraceptives than Republicans, who tend to favor abstinence only education. There have been enough studies out there showing that abstinence only education simply doesn’t work, so I won’t rehash them.</p>
<p>But there is a second transmission mechanism that is particularly interesting for me –I believe that for the most part, if abortion is an issue of choice, economic considerations must enter into the mind making a decision. In particular – the person making the decision will consider her income. (We’ve already seen that the economy grows faster under Democrats than under Republicans, and the disparity becomes pretty big if one takes into account growth in the national debt. Put another way… Democratic Presidents seem to have policies that lead to faster economic growth.)</p>
<p>Notice what I wrote: her income. Because the rate of abortions has been decreasing over time, and real incomes have been rising, in general we expect a negative correlation between real incomes and abortions just because of the direction the two series are moving. But this negative correlation may well be just a coincidence. We need a way to determine if it is just a coincidence or not.</p>
<p>Which leads us to this… if income is correlated with abortions, then female income should be more strongly correlated with abortions than male income. This is because while a male may be involved in the decision about whether to have an abortion, except in very rare instances a female will be involved in the decision. </p>
<p>Now, how do we measure abortions? Data on abortions is available from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0096.xls">the Census</a>. It provides the number of abortions, the rate of abortions per thousand women (age 15 to 44), and the ratio per thousand live births. (Note – this data is more complete than the series I used in my earlier post – it goes back to 1975!) Of these three measures, the one that is most strictly related to a choice of any sort is the last one. After all, the total number of abortions and the number of abortions per thousand women will rise and fall depending on whether more women are age 22 or 44. On the other hand, a woman that is capable of carrying a child to term is also capable of having an abortion, and vice versa in most instances.</p>
<p>Thus, we can compare the correlation of real income of males to the ratio of abortions per thousand live births to the correlation of real income of females to the ratio of abortions per thousand live births. Regardless of the direction of that correlation, we expect the absolute value of that correlation to be higher for females.</p>
<p>Note that the census table also provides data for abortions by Whites and abortions by Blacks. Thus, we can test for all groups, Whites only, and Blacks only. (Data on real median income comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p08ar.html">real median income for males and females of all ethnic groups</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p05w.html">real median income for White males and females</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p05b.html">real median income for Black males and females</a> is also available from the census.</p>
<p>Finally, because real incomes have tended to rise, and because abortions have tended to fall since the early 1980s one might want to also consider in effect “detrend” the data. (Note – this is not true for Black people – abortion rates per thousand live births among Black women have tended to bounce around in a narrow range, never really decreasing, throughout the entire period. Its outside the scope of this post to speculate on why.) A fairly standard way (at least for econometricians) to make the data “stationary” is simply to take either the first difference of the series.  I&#8217;ve always thought looking at the percentage change in the series is a bit more intuitive, so I&#8217;ve done that instead.  (I hope readers with a strong background in statistics will forgive my lack of precision in this paragraph.)</p>
<p>The tables below do all of this. Tables 1, 2, and 3 look at the correlation between real income and the ratio of abortions per thousand women. Each table shows this correlation for the real income of both men and women, and the tables show this information for all ethnic groups, White people, and Black people.</p>
<p>Tables 4, 5, and 6 are the same, but they look at the percentage change in each series. What do we see? Well, in every single case – every single one, the correlation is higher for women’s income than for men’s income. (Granted, on the very last table the two figures are close, but even then the result holds.) </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlGGMSSzD2I/AAAAAAAAAMY/vO875WrddgU/s1600-h/abortions+and+income.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlGGMSSzD2I/AAAAAAAAAMY/vO875WrddgU/s320/abortions+and+income.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From this, it seems very likely that the median income of women is either affecting the rate of abortions (or at least being moved by the same factors as those that affect the rate of abortions). Now, I would assume at most a fraction of a percent of Americans would disagree with the idea that ideally there would be fewer abortions, whether they feel abortions should be made illegal or, as Bill Clinton put it, “safe, legal, and rare.” My reading of the data &#8211; if one wants to reduce the likelihood of a woman ending her pregnancy with an abortion (except among Black women), one should try to increase the real median income, and probably, in particular, the real median income of females.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>As always, drop me a line if you want my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>It occurs to me I need a post looking at how real income behaved across administrations. Hopefully, it will get written and posted in the next few days.</p>

                                <p>Persumably the Congress and the White House reached <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&#038;y=2007&#038;m=May&#038;x=20070511172000saikceinawz0.2281153">an understanding</a> whereby the environment and labor standards will be &#8220;enforceably&#8221; included in up-coming trade negotiations, one of which is with Colombia, notorious for killing more labor leaders than all other countries combined.</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the administration-Congress deal, U.S. free-trade partners will have to abide by basic international labor standards outlined in a 1998 International Labor Organization (ILO) declaration. They also would have to adopt and enforce laws consistent with seven major multilateral environmental agreements.</p></blockquote>
<p>To read the ILO declaration, go <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/declaris/DECLARATIONWEB.static_jump?var_language=EN&#038;var_pagename=DECLARATIONTEXT">here</a>.</p>
<p>For a good overview of the understanding between Congress and the White House, read Jay Van Andel&#8217;s description on the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/wm1454.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a> website.</p>
<p>The nuts and bolts of the understanding are not fleshed out&#8211;or not leaked out. The U.S. itself &#8220;has not ratified&#8221; many of the ILO conventions. I suspect the Bush/Democrat understanding may be more smoke and mirrors. But read the Heritages&#8217;s description; you will start to see some of the issues and the problems.</p>
<p>At least the terms of the debate have altered slightly: Labor and the environment are now on the table, momentarily.</p>
<p>There is a growing awareness that globalization is not quite what it was trumpeted to be. In his one of his latest pieces, In &#8220;Divided over Trade&#8221; Krugman concedes two important points:</p>
<ol>
<li>That low wages in third world countries are in fact pushing down wages in the U.S.</li>
<li>That U.S. should include &#8220;strong labor standards&#8221; in our pending trade agreements&#8221; with third world countries, albeit those agreements may not achieve much.</li>
</ol>
<p>Labor abitrage in the form of sweat shops and child labor is a reality, part of what Krugman concedes is &#8220;the dark side of globalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no, cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart aren&#8217;t adequate compensation,&#8221; says Krugman. Again, I agree. But where was Krugman when China was about to enter the WTO? Where was Krugman on NAFTA?</p>
<p>As for the tools to meet this reality, Krugman mentions only one: Universal health care in the U.S. Universal health care will certainly help; after all, even China has included socialized health care in its future plans.</p>
<p>But is health care sufficient? I do not think so. Besides, how will the U.S. pay for it? Insurance vouchers? Government run? New taxes? On whom? We are already deep in debt.</p>
<p>And will &#8220;strong labor&#8221; standards pass WTO muster in countries already receiving &#8220;most favoured nation&#8221; status. Again, I do not think so, not unless those standards are included in the present Doha round. Just how will labor standards be enforced? Or is this just more temporizing?</p>
<p>And what should we do with the disaster NAFTA , a disaster that has failed to stem the tide of impoverished Mexicans fleeing northward? Mexico now has a nice trade surplus with U.S. The answer is, of course, to expand NAFTA to include Colombia, Peru, and Panama, whose average wages/hour are $0.80, $0.98, and $1.07 respectively. Suddenly, these poor countries are vital to our well being. Colombia? Peru? Well, business can always send troublesome U.S. labor leaders to Colombia. I am sure Walmart would approve.</p>
<p>Somehow, I cannot shake the comparison between the Iraq war and our trade policy. When all else fails in Iraq, instead of seriously looking at why we are there, we send in more troops. With trade, instead of seriously looking at why our trade and account deficit grows, we add more poor nations. And, begrudingly, we toss in labor and environmental standards that have as yet no specificity and little open public debate.</p>
<p>One uncomfortable fact that has received much attention and less explanation is the rising inequality of wealth worldwide. Krugman alluded to it when he complained that &#8220;profits&#8221; are not trickling down to workers. How can this be?</p>
<p>I think we should start putting some facts together. Or maybe we should just forget about labor and environmental standards. Let&#8217;s put Hillary back on Walmart&#8217;s Board of Directors. Walmart would approve of sending disgruntled U.S. labor leaders to Colombia.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDg1MTY4YTk1MDI0NzUwMDE5MzZjZjI1ZWVlOGYyOTY=">James Capretta</a> rehashes some often heard spin regarding fiscal policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many Americans would be surprised to learn that the federal budget outlook has improved considerably over the last three years. The gap between federal revenue and spending continues to narrow, with the full-year deficit for 2007 likely to come in near 1.1 percent of GDP (or lower) &#8211; which would make 2007 one of the best budget years of the last four decades.  The public’s surprise at the improving budget picture would be understandable since a shrinking deficit runs directly counter to the media’s portrayal of a hopeless U.S. fiscal situation caused by the Bush tax cuts. The remarkable, three-year revenue surge simply does not fit with that storyline.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also does not fit with the forecasts in table B.78 of the most recent <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/tables07.html">Economic Report of the President</a>.  For fiscal year 2007, total Federal debt is expected to grow by $556.4 billion, which would represent over 4% of GDP.  The forecasted increase for fiscal year 2008 is even higher.  Capretta, however, is talking about the unified deficit which represents the increase in the debt held by the public.  The Economic Report of the President is suggesting that the debt held by the public will rise by $254.3 billion or 1.75% of GDP.  </p>
<p>But could the Economic Report of the President be up to the old Bush trick – forecast a high deficit so when the actual deficit comes in lower, tout the same free lunch supply-side stupidity that Capretta writes regarding growth and tax revenues?  Even if the debt held by the public grows by only $150 billion, the General Fund deficit will still be over $450 billion.  This allegedly incredible shrinking deficit is not evidence of some Laffer curve supply-side stupidity. Rather, it is a combination of two factors.  One is that economies tend to recover from recessions – with or without tax cuts.  The other is the rising Trust Fund surpluses.  But Capretta is writing for the National Review, which means he pretends that the Trust Fund does not exist.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The folks at U.S. Customs recently issued <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/legal/informed_compliance_pubs">Determining the Acceptability of Transaction Value for Related Party Transactions</a>, which is likely to be seen as another regulatory headache for foreign manufacturers that sell their goods into the U.S. through local distribution affiliates.  Here is the key reason why this will be seen as another headache:</p>
<blockquote><p>Increasingly, importers are asking CBP to rule that a related party transaction value is acceptable under the circumstances of sale test because it meets the arm&#8217;s length principle for tax purposes. In some cases, the importer provides evidence that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has agreed that the importer&#8217;s transfer pricing methodology is the &#8220;best method,&#8221; as defined in Treasury regulations under IRC section 482, for tax purposes through an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), or audit. In other cases, the importer provides a transfer pricing study prepared for IRC section 6662 purposes that demonstrates that the transactions are arm&#8217;s length under one of the IRS methods … Importers sometimes claim that a related party transaction value is acceptable because it satisfies the Section 482 arm&#8217;s length principle as determined using the best transfer pricing method. Sometimes, a copy of an APA or transfer pricing study is submitted along with the claim. In various rulings addressing this issue, CBP has determined that an APA or transfer pricing study by itself is not sufficient to show that a related party transaction value is an acceptable transaction value. CBP has noted that although the broad goal of both the relevant provisions of the customs and the tax law is the same, i.e., to ensure that related party transactions are at arm&#8217;s length, there are substantial differences in the legal requirements.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words having a reasoned argument that the intercompany pricing is consistent with market pricing (arm’s length) isn’t enough.  Now to be fair to Customs, all the IRS cares about is whether the declared price is too high.  If the IRS thinks it is too low, then it will not object.  But what about the foreign tax authority?  If the intercompany pricing is deemed arm’s length by the foreign tax authority, shouldn’t Customs be satisfied?</p>

<p>I was curious how much of our imported goods are considered related party transactions and <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2006pr/aip/related_party">this source</a> came through.  The Census Bureau notes over $1845 billion in imported goods for 2006 with over $982 billion (53.24%) being related party transactions.  But then I was wondering how much we collect in customs duties as a percent of imported goods and it turns out to be less than 1.5%.  It seems a lot of goods are imported duty free, but some have higher duty rates.  Using data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>, we can graph the customs duty to imported goods ratio from 1929 to 2006.  Not surprisingly, this ratio was a lot lower in 2006 than it was during Herbert Hoover’s Administration.  Then again – if we eliminated all tariffs, customs would not have to worry about whether intercompany prices were arm’s length.  But a few customs attorneys would then have to find alternative ways to make a living.</p>

<blockquote><p>Look, I have no doubt Wolfowitz was doomed from the state. But to comprehend his doomed-ness and what to make of it, one needs to step back. Why was he given the job in the first place? He had no obviously qualifications for it. He&#8217;s read some neoliberal political commentary about the need for international development strategies to focus more on good governance. I&#8217;ve read that stuff, too. As have a lot of people. It&#8217;s convincing stuff. But, genuinely, folks who&#8217;ve read it are a dime a dozen in this town. Do I get to run the World Bank? No. Wolfowitz had no genuine expertise in Africa, in development policy, in economics, in governance, or in any of the relevant fields. </p>
<p>What he did have, that I lacked, was a track-record as a high-level political employee. It was a track-record marked by . . . spectacular failure. Failure so spectacular that George W. Bush decided Wolfowitz needed to be fired from his job because he was so incredibly bad at it. In order to fire him while minimizing feather-rumpling, he was dumped on the Bank, even though he had no relevant expertise and a long track-record of failure (think Team B) in his previous work. So, yes, he was doomed from the start. Boo-hoo.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with Yglesias&#8217; first and last sentence, but I agree with everything in between.  And I note&#8230; when I lived in the corporate world, I saw the same sort of thing.  I believe by far the most incompetent person I ever had the misfortune to do any work for was pretty high in a Fortune 500 company.  He was also extremely well connected.   He oversaw several spectacular and costly failures.  After each one, people who worked on the projects were fired, but never him.  Long story short &#8211; its been quite a few years, but he&#8217;s still there.  That&#8217;s not quite true.  I understand he has a lot more responsibility now.  And the company seems to be doing well.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Not long ago, I had a post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/nigerians-big-penises-and-big-breasts.html">spam</a> and I specifically mentioned the Nigerian kind, the big breast type, and the big penises type. I probably should have thrown in the lottery-you-never-entered-but-managed-to-win-anyway type too. Ah well. Lost opportunities.</p>
<p>I like to check our site meter every so often, and one day a while after that, I noticed that we were getting incoming traffic from people searching for big breasts on google. I noted in a post at the time that we came up 11th in a search on google. </p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve moved up to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=big+breasts">tenth place</a>. And on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=big+penises">big penises</a>? We&#8217;re now number 6. Its one heck of a jump&#8230; we weren&#8217;t in the top 500 when last I checked. Word is getting around&#8230; </p>
<p>Which leads to some questions about the effectiveness of google and other serach engines. I&#8217;m assuming that most people who find their way to Angry Bear as a result of these searches don&#8217;t stay, and leave disappointed if not irritated given we&#8217;re not in the habit of making pornography available over here. (The only exception I can think of being <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/random-cat-blogging.html">this</a>. For those who clicked on that link, we&#8217;re now talking more than 20 pounds!!!!) </p>
<p>I wish I understood how search engines reach the conclusions they do. I&#8217;d love to move Angry Bear up in the rankings, or my own newly constructed website where I advertise my consulting services. (I just got a new domain name and everything! I haven&#8217;t yet linked up to the search engines though.) But I also wonder whether perhaps google and the other engines should find a way to keep track of how closely a website it points to matches the needs of its users. The one obvious one that comes to mind&#8230; does the user return to the search engine, and if so, after how long? A user that doesn&#8217;t return at all probably found exactly what he/she is looking for. Someone that hit return after 2 seconds probably did not.</p>
<p>Does that measure make sense? Are there others?</p>

<p>Back on May 10, I was complaining about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-gasoline-prices-and-refineries.html">high gasoline prices</a> but did not yet have official data on the role of refinery margins during April 2007.  Well, my graph has been extended to April and no surprise – real gasoline prices have indeed increased (if you had to fill the tank like I did today – forgive me for stating the obvious) and much of the reason is an increase in the refinery margin from $0.59 per gallon to $0.77 per gallon.  Given all the press roar about a shortage of refinery capacity, you might have expected more of the increase to be from refinery margins.  But yes – some of the recent increase was due to higher oil prices and my use of historical April data misses what’s happened in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>But the main reason for this post is to let folks know about a time series on <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/wpuleus3w.htm">refinery capacity</a> that my fellow Angrybear Cactus informed me about.  The most recent observation was just under 90%, which is lower than the 95% figure that the press is touting as capacity before the Katrina effect.  So how do we interpret the fact that refinery capacity is down even though refinery margins are up?  The press seems to be eating up the inward shift of the supply curve hypothesis.  This perfect competition model leads <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/05/price-gouging.html">many economists</a> to argue price controls would be a bad idea.  </p>
<p>Certainly, the dip in refinery capacity and rise in refinery margins after Katrina should be seen as inward shift of the supply curve.  But did Katrina and Hurricane lead to such a decline in refinery supply that we still are feeling the effects?  Or is the fall in output and the rise in prices due to some cartel behavior?  If the latter is the case, price controls might be a means of lowering prices and increasing production.</p>
