                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This one is by reader T-Bone&#8230;</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to stay in Iraq, we need a new strategy. Unfortunately, I have no faith in the current administration of seeing reality or any solutions.</p>
<p>Now as I understand things, Al-Qaeda operates as a decentralized network. There is no head or director of operations to cut off. It&#8217;s just like you and a few of your friends, with some of your friends who know these other friends, and so on. And there&#8217;s no way to tell a terrorist apart from an Iraqi. </p>
<p>In Iraq, unemployment and desperate poverty is rampant&#8230; numbering in the millions, and surprisingly is getting worse! Inflation and the large amounts of reconstruction money being lost to corruption are just making the problem worse. So to make a buck (or 50 bucks), many Iraqis have found a decent employer&#8230; The terrorists. They plant bombs, shoot people, and do other simple tasks to make a buck to feed their families and themselves. A friend of mine in the army tells me about the guys they catch planting IEDs, how they are just doing it for the money, but are otherwise just an impoverish Iraqi nobody. </p>
<p>That presents another problem&#8230; We&#8217;re not catching the real terrorists when we catch these &#8220;errand runners&#8221;. We catch small-time &#8220;criminals&#8221; (if you can call working for necessities criminal). The number of IEDs in Iraq have been increasing tremendously (although deaths from them have remained steady). I&#8217;d guess that this is caused by Al-Qaeda becoming more connected to more of these poor unemployed Iraqis, developing a network of sorts&#8230; the kind of stuff we probably should be doing&#8230; And of course we have the sectarian violence as well, which I&#8217;d guess is related to poverty and unemployment as well. </p>
<p>In any case, thats a lot of bombs. Please tell me we have a ton of bomb sniffing dogs over there walking the streets&#8230; I&#8217;m sure people who spend time in an improvised bomb factory don&#8217;t have the chance to shower and wash their clothes before they leave&#8230; Where&#8217;s the suggestion box where I send these ideas? Hmm, nevermind, even the generals of the military aren&#8217;t allowed to make suggestions&#8230; </p>
<p>What can we do? But now that we&#8217;re done watching American Idol, perhaps we can start feeling like we&#8217;re at war in terms of the economy, like in the old days of the World Wars. We haven&#8217;t changed our habits at all here. We&#8217;re out there buying things on our credit cards, while the government continues to spend spend spend us into huge deficits, even while giving our richest more tax breaks, while the fed keeps interest rates extremely low to try to do what the tax cuts for the rich won&#8217;t ever do &#8212; grow the economy, and those low interest rates allow us to buy home we can&#8217;t afford while driving up inflation. </p>
<p>Well why don&#8217;t we reverse those tax cuts for the rich that we can&#8217;t afford, actually invest real money and sacrifice into the reconstruction, humanitarian, and employment efforts in Iraq, and perhaps show a little bit of willingness to sacrifice that troops on the ground show. And maybe, just maybe, we can start a new slogan for consumers&#8230; </p>
<p>&#8220;Buy Iraqi&#8221;</p>
<p>Economically speaking if we&#8217;re going to solve Iraq&#8217;s unemployment problems, we&#8217;re going to have to provide lots of money. And I don&#8217;t think just any unskilled worker can take part in certain reconstruction efforts. So we can either do it through hiring unskilled Iraqi&#8217;s to dig and refill holes, or other forms of inefficiency for the sake of hiring people, or we can provide a market for real goods paid for by consumers who at least get something out of the deal. There must be a way. Maybe subsidize the goods. Hey, how bout a little &#8220;communism&#8221; to go along with the &#8220;democracy&#8221;, where our government owns the means of production for a while&#8230; For their retirement plan, we&#8217;ll give them shares of stock in the business. Who cares if the businesses need to go in the red a little bit, at least that red isn&#8217;t blood red. Because honestly, I don&#8217;t think capitalism is working too well right now in that situation over there. Who wants to open a business in Iraq? </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230; and this post ties in nicely with something I&#8217;ve been noting for a very long time &#8211; since the point when we&#8217;ve been treated to the incessant &#8220;things are wonderful in Iraq, just look at all the painted schoolhouses&#8221; story-line. As I noted, none of the folks who peddle that story line seem willing to take their families on a vacation to Iraq. T-Bone reminds us that they don&#8217;t have to risk their lives to put their money where their mouths are.</p>

<blockquote><p>The federal government recorded a $1.3 trillion loss last year — far more than the official $248 billion deficit — when corporate-style accounting standards are used, a USA TODAY analysis shows.</p>
<p>The loss reflects a continued deterioration in the finances of Social Security and government retirement programs for civil servants and military personnel. The loss — equal to $11,434 per household — is more than Americans paid in income taxes in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on an unsustainable path and doing a great disservice to future generations,&#8221; says Chris Chocola, a former Republican member of Congress from Indiana and corporate chief executive who is pushing for more accurate federal accounting.</p>
<p>Modern accounting requires that corporations, state governments and local governments count expenses immediately when a transaction occurs, even if the payment will be made later.</p>
<p>The federal government does not follow the rule, so promises for Social Security and Medicare don&#8217;t show up when the government reports its financial condition.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Taxpayers are now on the hook for a record $59.1 trillion in liabilities, a 2.3% increase from 2006. That amount is equal to $516,348 for every U.S. household. By comparison, U.S. households owe an average of $112,043 for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and all other debt combined.</p>
<p>Unfunded promises made for Medicare, Social Security and federal retirement programs account for 85% of taxpayer liabilities. State and local government retirement plans account for much of the rest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really quick thought&#8230;  we have readers like Bruce Webb and Coberly who read through the Social Security Trustee&#8217;s Report every year.  Bruce Webb tells us that the Social Security position seems to have improved with each report he&#8217;s read, and since he backs it up with numbers and examples, I suspect he&#8217;s right.  And I wonder how you value the future obligations of, say, a treaty to defend Taiwan.  </p>
<p>I doubt the figures in the article are accurate, but I don&#8217;t have any problem believing that there&#8217;s a lot of financial sleight of hand in the government books.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have been busy of late&#8230;and will be for a few more weeks. But I thought the following Bloomberg article might be of interest those who persist in claiming that China is not costing us jobs&#8230;or should I say, China in partnership with our own multinationals is not costing us jobs.</p>
<p>Here is the key section of the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;sid=aKFeuLhHgSuc&#038;refer=home">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To his meetings with Vice Premier Wu Yi in Washington last week, Paulson brought the now familiar charge that China is unfairly holding down its currency and costing the U.S. jobs. Wu brought something far more potent: an argument poking holes in the contention that U.S. imbalances are China&#8217;s fault.<br /><i>Roughly 85 percent of China&#8217;s trade surplus is generated by foreign companies exporting products from China that are no longer made in the U.S., such as shoes.</i> Wu mentioned that inconvenient fact when she said &#8220;we should not easily blame the other side for our own domestic problems.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>As I have said repeatedly, the fault is not China&#8217;s, but our own corporations seeking profits in exporting from China. China is, of course, one of the many landing fields that our corporations have found in developing countries. Eight-five percent? That is a bit higher than my usual 60% figure, but Yi&#8217;s point stands: &#8220;Don&#8217;t blame China; blame your own corporations!&#8221;</p>
<p>I am always surprised that my usual number of 60% is never challenged. (I reserve the 80%+ number for IT exports.) But for those refusing to acknowledge even the range these numbers, I include some citations.</p>
<p>First is <a href="http://www.moneyweek.com/file/29194/what-is-the-real-solution-to-americas-trade-deficit.html">Stephen Roach</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>There is a final misperception about the oft-feared Chinese exporter. It turns out that China has become an important efficiency solution for many of the world’s multinational corporations. China’s so-called foreign-invested enterprises – basically, Chinese subsidiaries of multinationals – have accounted for more than 60% of the explosive growth of overall Chinese exports over the past decade. That raises serious questions about the real identity of the widely feared, all-powerful Chinese exporter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/02/16/ford-motorola-siemens-ent-manage-cx_kw_0216wharton.html">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>About 60% of Chinese manufacturing exports are by companies headquartered outside China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps we should ask <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200602/15/eng20060215_243015.html">Yi Xiaozhun</a>, China&#8217;s Vice Commerce Minister when he says:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Foreign-funded enterprises in China enjoyed 83 percent if China&#8217;s total foreign trade surplus and accounted for 58 percent of China&#8217;s total exports, announced Vice Commerce Minister Yi Xiaozhun at China-US Business Forum in Beijing on Feb. 14, 2006</p></blockquote>
<p>Some have simplistically accused me of China bashing. Not so. China is not stealing our jobs; nor are any of the other developing countries. Our companies have simply decided to move; they then sell the goods back to us, using a different set of workers. Of course, once an industry has moved completely offshore, who is left to complain? This is truly a marvelous arrangement. Our companies prosper. Our trade deficit increases; but deficits of all kinds are really nothing to worry about&#8230;or so we are told.</p>
<p>The answer, we are often told, is for the U.S. to consume less and save more. The problem with this solution is that the Chinese are not ready to consume on that kind of scale. The average Chinese wage simply cannot take up the &#8220;buying slack.&#8221; We have, I think, a Mexican&#8230;should I say, Chinese?&#8230;stand-off. If the U.S. starts to save, who does the buying? What happens to all those industrious Chinese working for that export machine? Do they return to the farms? This is part of the problem that may drive the world&#8217;s economy off a cliff.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it is true that multinationals are driving Chinese exports, then we really should not fear China at all. China should be the one that should be worried, worried about foreign nationals gobbling up entire chains of production.</p>
<p>But the Chinese Government has made some money out of all this as its entry into the Blackstone Group attests. Who knows, maybe someday it will buy Intel or Walmart. Or maybe it will simply decide to nationalize some of the foreign industries now in China. Damned if I know how all this will turn out. But that Blackstone deal I find a bit curious.</p>
<p>N.B. Minor typying mistake corrected.</p>

                                <p>I was wandering through the Blackwater USA site. The header to <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/btw2007/archive/052107btw.htm">this page</a> was the photo below:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlzGnCSzD-I/AAAAAAAAANY/jg6uB4hc_U4/s1600-h/blackwater.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlzGnCSzD-I/AAAAAAAAANY/jg6uB4hc_U4/s320/blackwater.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, I found <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/press/bwhk.asp">this picture</a>: </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlzHjCSzD_I/AAAAAAAAANg/v6O1A_0KtUc/s1600-h/blackwater+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlzHjCSzD_I/AAAAAAAAANg/v6O1A_0KtUc/s320/blackwater+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/press/newsdefault.asp">Fox News Video</a> that allows you to see, among other things, Blackwater folks doing their job in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also gives you a look at Blackwater&#8217;s new vehicle, the Grizzly.</p>
<p>Now, the other day I had <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/iraq.html">a post</a> that stated things like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Put another way&#8230; the Iraqis don&#8217;t seem to think that Blackwater is in their country legally, but the company is clearly there at the request of the American government. Seems kind of an odd situation for a sovereign country.</p>
<p>And another thing&#8230; (as one of Steve Benen&#8217;s commentators asks): are Blackwater employees readily identifiable as not being American troops? Somehow, I doubt it. In the minds of the average Iraqi, when they see something done by a Blackwater employee, they automatically assume its done by &#8220;Americans.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, look at the above pictures, and watch the Fox video. Say that some folks from Blackwater light up another carful of Iraqis or has another standoff with Iraqi troops. (I don&#8217;t think either of these events is particularly unlikely given the state of chaos that exists in Iraq.  The best trained personnel in the world cannot avoid causing damage to third parties, even innocent victims, in such an environment.) Perhaps some of the Blackwater folks are in a Grizzly when it happens, and the rest are dressed as Blackwater publicity photos might lead us to believe they would be dressed.  (Note &#8211; I really don&#8217;t think those are stock images.  Those look to me like official Blackwater photos.)</p>
<p>If you asked some Iraqis who happen to witness that, who are they going to say did it? Are they going to say, &#8220;It was some folks from Blackwater. The US military had nothing to do with it&#8221;? My guess&#8230; they&#8217;re going to say, very simply and succinctly, &#8220;It was the Americans.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, for those who will insist on misinterpreting this post, I am not against the US military, nor am I against Blackwater. I am merely trying to point out &#8211; the activity of military contractors reflects on US troops in Iraq and affects how the locals see US troops, and whether its right or wrong, fair or unfair, its true. Period. End of story. If the contractors are subject to looser rules, and are less likely to be punished for infractions, both of which seem to be the case, US troops will suffer for it. Hearts and minds.</p>

<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; In defending the Iraq war, leading Republican presidential contenders are increasingly echoing words and phrases used by President Bush in the run-up to the war that reinforce the misleading impression that Iraq was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>
<p>In the May 15 Republican debate in South Carolina, Senator John McCain of Arizona suggested that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden would &#8220;follow us home&#8221; from Iraq &#8212; a comment some viewers may have taken to mean that bin Laden was in Iraq, which he is not.</p>
<p>Former New York mayor Rudolph Guiliani asserted, in response to a question about Iraq, that &#8220;these people want to follow us here and they have followed us here. Fort Dix happened a week ago. &#8220;</p>
<p>However, none of the six people arrested for allegedly plotting to attack soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey were from Iraq.</p>
<p>Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney identified numerous groups that he said have &#8220;come together&#8221; to try to bring down the United States, though specialists say few of the groups Romney cited have worked together and only some have threatened the United States.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is cactus again&#8230; I would go farther. I&#8217;ve always found that I can&#8217;t be an expert on everything, or even very many things, so its necessary to have some trust in other peoples&#8217; judgements. Which other people should I trust? Well, if someone misleads or flat out lies on something that I have a bit of information about, I&#8217;m not going to trust them on other things either. Everyone makes mistakes, but most of us stop when our mistakes are pointed out. What can one make of candidates for President that don&#8217;t.</p>

                                <p>It is my pleasure to respond to the many interesting responses I have received to my posting on Angry Bear. I&#8217;m starting with responses to the 18 comments on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/bob-hormats-here-tuesday-morning.html">initial announcement</a> of my visit. Tomorrow I will respond to the dozens of comments on my first post. Thanks for your patience &#8212; you are an active group and I&#8217;m trying to keep up.</p>
<p>Coberly is correct.  We should not cut Social Security to pay for a war.  My concern about the growing outlays from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is that if they continue on their current trajectories they will swamp all other programs in the budget — and lead to higher interest rates and higher taxes, and since the tax that pays for Social Security is the Payroll tax — which is very regressive –- it will hurt low and middle income wage earners. I favor cutting a lot of non-essential domestic programs before cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits, but I am afraid that at some point we will need to find a way of increasing inflows into such programs — preferably from high income earners, and curbing the growth benefits to upper income people to make these programs sustainable for those who really need them.</p>
<p>This would have to be done even if the Defense Budget were zero. But because it is not zero, and we still will have international and Homeland Security expenses well after the Iraq War, this is yet another reason to put these programs on a more sustainable basis. And I also agree with Coberly that Social Security is less than 5% percent of GDP now; in fact it has a surplus now. The issue comes toward the end of the next decade; my book <i>The Price of Liberty</i> describes this concern in its last chapter. I want to be sure there is money for our elderly and medically needy; that is essential. But I also think we need to make sure there is also money for our national security. That will require some better long-term planning than we are seeing today.</p>
<p>To Dale: Thanks for making the point about waste in military spending. This needs to be corrected, as does the earmarking of defense and homeland security projects. Correcting these things are both good economics and good for national security in that it will strengthen the credibility of the funds that the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department do ask for. And as for an attack on entitlements, as I mentioned to Coberly, I do not attack entitlements.  I want to put them on a sustainable basis for those who need them. And to do so we need to look ahead. I am sorry I was not clearer on this. It should not be a zero sum game. All programs, military spending and entitlements need to be looked at to be sure that the funds are well spent; entitlements need to go to those who need them. And those who do not should do with a little less.</p>
<p>To Sammy: Good point.  I think that asking Americans to make sacrifices for any war does two things; one, it gives citizens a vested interest in the war, as was the case in World War II and it avoids hiding of the war, as was the case in Iraq and Vietnam. All I am asking for is an honest dialogue with the American people on what a war costs — so they understand that it cannot be financed by sleight of hand. That would enable Americans to make an informed decision as to whether they want to make sacrifices to support their troops — which most Americans will — and our leaders to have a more direct dialogue with Americans. Skirting the budget issue neither promotes an open dialogue nor enables Americans to determine what the war will actually cost them. Since no war is free, understanding the cost at the outset is good politics and good for a democracy.</p>
<p>To Patrick R. Sullivan: We do have bonds today, since much of this war is paid for by borrowing, but we do not have a candid presentation about how much of our current borrowing is war related, tax cut related, or for other things. In fact, it is for all of them. But because borrowing can be done relatively easily at relatively low rates it looks easier than borrowing for past wars.</p>
<p>To PGL: Very well put.  Better than I could have done myself. If we do not pay for our war, the cost is passed to the next generation.  And you are also right on Social Security; the Social Security Surplus is disguising the actual size of the deficit and making the war easier to finance because it disguises its cost and indeed the cost of running the entire government.  I describe this in greater detail in the last chapter of my book; the Concorde Coalition also highlights it.  I am concerned about deficit financing not only for financial reasons — although that will be a huge problem in the next decade when the costs of entitlement and discretionary spending and interest payments are added up and compared against the inflow of revenues — but because it is a horrible legacy for coming generations. In my book, I cite a wonderful quote from George Washington’s farewell address in which he warned against “ungenerously throwing upon future generations the debts we ourselves ought to bear.”  That goes for us too. </p>
<p>To Ken Melvin: I am not sure whether we are spending too much for these programs or not, but we should certainly take a hard look at them through the use of Congressional oversight — as in the case of the Truman Commission during World War II. My concern is that we are not spending some of the money smartly. And a lot of stuff is added by Congress for local constituency benefits which is not needed — or put into Homeland Security not on the basis if risk but for more political reasons.</p>
<p>To Sammy: I do care that some Social Security and other benefits go to people who don’t need them. Correcting that should be one part of the reform process.<br />Coberly asks some additional questions about the cost of future entitlement programs. All these are valid. The best way to get the answers is from the reports of the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare and from groups such as the Concord Coalition. These numbers are very similar — and these are the figures I cite in my book. One key point is that borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund now finances a substantial portion of our budget deficit. This misleads Americans into thinking that the deficit is lower than it really is. But when the surplus turns to a deficit in the next decade that will change.</p>
<p>To Josh G.: I am not arguing to slash social programs to pay for the military. They should be put on a more sustainable basis for their own internal reasons of keeping faith with the people who will need them in coming decades. These numbers didn’t come from me; I got them from the people who run these programs. And, on another point, I think that terrorists do represent a threat — not only the ones in caves but the ones who are planning attacks here and on our allies.</p>
<p>To Lysistrada: I am not suggesting using the payroll tax to finance the military budget. Soon it will not even cover the costs of the Social Security System. Also, I do not believe and did not believe at the time that we needed a tax cut for people in the upper income bracket — and if one were to be passed I did not think it should last for ten years. And I have been all in favor of raising the minimum wage. But regarding FDR, he did cut programs for a lot of middle income people; many New Deal programs were cut during World War II. But I am not suggesting that now. I am not suggesting that any programs for low or middle income people should be cut; my discussion of Social Security and other reforms goes to the point of ensuring that they are around for coming generations for those who need them. And there are risks if they are not reformed; even with a zero defense budget that would be needed. Please read the reports of the people who run these programs and look at the numbers and look at the reports of the bipartisan Concord Coalition. And then let&#8217;s discuss this further.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much for your contributions.  More responses will be posted tomorrow.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_05/011386.php">Kevin Drum</a> had an amazing post the other day:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]here&#8217;s a distinction between &#8220;rational&#8221; and &#8220;good,&#8221; and most of us know it when we see it. Thomas Jefferson, for example, kept slaves because it was, after all, a rational thing to do. He needed the money his slaves brought in and he was too weak-willed to forego that money and free them. However, he also argued that slavery was wrong and should be banned — a position that&#8217;s usually presented as an unfathomable paradox. But it&#8217;s not. Jefferson wanted slavery banned because he understood that individuals often lack the willpower to do individually what they know is right. Sometimes it takes the power of community action to force ourselves to do good things that we can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) do on our own. </p>
<p>In the marketplace we are competitive, selfish, meanspirited, and xenophobic, so it&#8217;s no surprise that left to its own devices that&#8217;s the kind of society a free market will produce — in fact, has produced at various points in history. But although we&#8217;re seldom strong enough to personally sacrifice our own immediate economic self-interests (yes, that means you too), we often recognize as a society that we ought to do better. And so, as long as the rules apply to all of us, we occasionally allow our better natures to be shamed, cajoled, or inspired into insisting on it. And civilization slowly progresses because of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would note&#8230; that&#8217;s not just a ballot box issue. that&#8217;s the way civilization as a whole works. As I&#8217;m writing this, my neighbor is out of town. Now, it occurs to me that it would make me better off in the short term to enter his apartment and, well, relieve him of items that I can use. No doubt there are a few million people in Los Angeles that can look at their neighbor&#8217;s stuff and state something very similar. </p>
<p>And in the short term, that&#8217;s true. But in the long run, society breaks down if we don&#8217;t accept some limits on our freedom. The only reason I feel its safe to leave the house most days in the knowledge that my stuff will be here when I get back is that I feel it is a bad idea to enter my neighbor&#8217;s place while he is away. The former cannot be true without the latter being true. (Though, the latter being true doesn&#8217;t always make the latter true.) So we choose to put limits on our freedom, to accept concepts like property rights. </p>
<p>But I have a few more thoughts. The line is drawn in an arbitrary place. It would probably disturb most Americans of others trekked through their turf simply because its inconvenient not to do so. (I understand that in the English country-side, you can go through someone else&#8217;s property to get to the other side under some circumstances.) </p>
<p>Closer to home, how many people in LA would think nothing of breaking into a refinery in Torrance and taking stuff we wanted away? Or using that refinery&#8217;s logo or trademarks. But is vice versa true? How much thought does the refinery in Torrance put into not taking away some of the clean air of the residents of LA, the same residents that wouldn&#8217;t dream of breaking into the refinery. What&#8217;s the difference?</p>
<p>I think the difference is this&#8230; we, as a society choose not to enforce property rights associated with physical or tangible things if the boundaries in which those things exist are not fixed. The refinery in Torrance kills fresh air first above its own property, than above everyone else&#8217;s. The @$$hole that drives down the street on a Harley which can be heard six blocks away every morning at 3AM first abuses his own eardrums, then everyone else&#8217;s. </p>
<p>Now, one might argue convenience. Its not convenient for the refinery to do something about its emissions, or for the guy on the Harley to do something about the noise he generates. But then, its not particularly convenient for people to have to purchase stuff when equivalent stuff is just lying around in their neighbor&#8217;s home, ripe for the taking.</p>
<p>Have we drawn the line in the right place?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;d like to thank the team at Angry Bear for giving me this opportunity to answer questions about my new book, &#8220;The Price of Liberty: Paying for America&#8217;s Wars.&#8221; If you haven&#8217;t gotten a chance yet, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/04/AR2007050402558.html">read the Outlook piece</a> I wrote for the Washington Post on May 6. This piece contains a few ideas distilled from my book. The Post has been kind enough to let us circulate it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a popular post on this blog called &#8220;How Not to Run a War.&#8221; Taking a cue from that, I want to briefly talk about &#8220;How Not to Pay For a War.&#8221;</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t pay for a war by INCREASING spending on non-essential domestic programs, particularly by increasing spending for &#8220;earmarked&#8221; politically inspired projects meant to satisfy domestic constituencies. In every war of the past, our government has cut non essential spending to make room in the budget to pay for the war. Not this time.</p>
<p>We should not pay virtually the entire cost of a war with &#8220;emergency supplementals&#8221; which skirt the normal budget process and thus avoid the normal scrutiny of determining what is really needed and what the tradeoffs are; even during the unpopular Vietnam War the use of supplementals was limited after the first couple of years.</p>
<p>And we should reflect in this post-Memorial Day period on a situation in which most Americans have been treated to tax cuts and many benefit from domestic spending for politically-inspired projects and generous subsidies while Americans fighting abroad and their families are making major sacrifices. That is unfair and unjust, and not consistent with the best traditions of America. No matter what one thinks of the war the troops should be well equipped, our wounded veterans should be given the best of care, and military families should be given the help they need to live at decent standards while their breadwinners are fighting abroad.</p>
<p>The challenge now is to learn from our mistakes and take them into account as we as a country determine how to pay for the longer war against terrorism and to be sure that the US remains financially resilient enough to counter future threats to our well being &#8212; whether from a catastrophic act of terrorism,  foreign crises that may erupt in areas such as the Middle East that threaten our allies or oil, another devastating hurricane or a major    pandemic.</p>
<p>So how should we prepare to pay for our future security over coming years? It won&#8217;t be easy given other demands on the budget, particularly projections for the rapidly growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the decade ahead.</p>
<p>And how do we meet the costs of these programs and our national security requirements without producing massive budget deficits and/or huge tax hikes? Or are these unavoidable?</p>
<p>I have some thoughts on these issues, which are included in my book and which I am looking forward to discussing on this blog tour over the next several days, but my major objective is to develop a dialogue in the hope that thoughtful people of various views can come up with sound solutions.</p>
<p>I welcome YOUR thoughts on these questions and promise to respond as soon as possible. Many thanks for joining me in the quest for answers to these difficult but important questions.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Tim Russert is getting a lot of credit for his “hard hitting interview” with <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18818527">Bill Richardson</a>.  Governor Richardson is said to have done poorly, which surprised me as I watched this interview, including this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. RUSSERT:  But let’s go through the resume a little bit.  First, there’s governor of New Mexico.  As you well know, they rank states in a whole variety of categories from one being the best, 50th being the worst.  This is New Mexico’s scorecard, and you are the governor.  Percent of people living below the poverty line, you’re 48.  Percent of children below, 48.  Median family income, 47.  People without health insurance, 49.  Children without health insurance, 46.  Teen high school dropouts, 47.  Death rate due to firearms, 48.  Violent crime rate, 46.  You’re the very bottom of all those statistics of all 50 states, and you’re the governor for five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the governor tried to explain that New Mexico has seen improvement in these areas, Russert fired back:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. RUSSERT:  But these rankings are troubling.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I watched this exchange, I thought to myself that for the executives of NBC to let Russert get away with such dishonesty is the troubling part.  Let me explain by pointing to a comparison of the poverty statistics over time.  Russert’s staff was likely looking at this <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/pov/new46_100125_01.htm">Census table</a> that does indeed show that two other states and the District of Columbia has higher poverty rates than New Mexico’s 17.9% rate.  But couldn’t that staff find <a href="http://www.unm.edu/~shri/images/NMReport200304.pdf">this report</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-too-familiar refrain in public discourse is that New Mexico is a poor state. Public recognition of New Mexico’s poverty in part comes from the state’s perennial ranking as one of the poorest states in the nation. Comparing state averages from 1998 to 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau lists New Mexico as No. 1 – with the highest percent of people in poverty in the nation (Dalaker, 2001). The 2000 census (which shows poverty rates for 1999) indicates that 18.4% of New Mexico’s population lives below the poverty level. The 2003 Kids Count report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation singled out New Mexico, Mississippi, and Louisiana with the highest child poverty rates in the nation – with 26% of children in each of these states living in poverty (Bryan, 2003).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h08a.html">This source</a> shows median income in 2005 was only $39,916 but it was only $37,509 in 2002 (both figures in real 2005$).  In other words, real median income rose by 6.4% over this three-year period and poverty has declined.  Russert’s focus on levels rather than changes had to be so transparent in its dishonesty, the executives at NBC had to know this. So why does this hack still have a job?  At one time, Meet the Press was a very good show.  But it has gone steadily downhill under the watch of Tim Russert.  Why NBC hasn’t fired him yet is beyond me.</p>
