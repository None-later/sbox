<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>My insurance in MA was cancelled on property due to ‘limiting risk exposure’ by my insurance company.  While near the coast, my investment property is not on a flood plain and well protected as well as being higher by far (40 ft.) than downtown.  I wound up having to buy from a MA backed plan at 1.5 multiplier for less coverage.</p>
<p>I got to thinking.  If I am getting cancelled, what’s up.  I went to Florida via the web because I had heard that Allstate was canceling most of its coverage in the state, and other companies were considering the possibility.  I found <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/22/national/main2381698.shtml">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Florida homeowners could see property insurance rates cut by as much as a total of 40 percent under a plan finalized Sunday by lawmakers hoping to reverse hurricane-fueled increases many residents say have threatened to price them out of their homes. </p>
<p>Lawmakers said the wide-ranging proposal they&#8217;ll vote on Monday is expected to provide savings of up to 20 percent for many of the coastal customers of Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-created company that has become Florida&#8217;s largest property insurer.</p>
<p>Getting the 20 percent rate reduction would require a number of factors, and the only guaranteed savings across the board appeared to be closer to 5 percent. But many customers will see much larger reductions, lawmakers said. </p>
<p>Rates for property owners insured by private companies are also expected to come down under the plan, which would still need approval from Republican Gov. Charlie Crist. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>   &#8230;</strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The state-created company was envisioned as a last-resort insurer for those who can&#8217;t get private coverage, but it has grown to be the state&#8217;s largest property insurer with 1.3 million customers. </p>
<p>Insurers including Allstate Corp., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., MetLife Inc. and State Farm have canceled or limited homeowners policies or significantly raised rates in an effort to reduce exposure to future catastrophes since the devastating hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, in which insurers lost $36 billion in Florida. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The industry also says the plan is a quick-fix bailout that puts more risk on the government. The plan increases the amount of backup coverage, or reinsurance, available to private insurance companies through the state&#8217;s Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. </p></blockquote>
<p>While the insurance is for homeowners, business also needs flood and hurricane insurance to operate in the area.  If Dade county is hit with a 4 or 5 force, the consequences would be huge.  The season is just starting.  Is this simple economics?  Which homeowners get the most benefit?  Does it preclude good zoning?  Are there any social aspects to consider?  How do businesses cope?</p>

                                <p>I often disagree with Craig Newmark of Newmark&#8217;s Door &#8211; now and then throughout the years we have exchanged correspondence. Here he <br /><a href="http://newmarksdoor.typepad.com/mainblog/2007/05/krugman_and_foo.html">disagrees with Krugman&#8217;s recent piece on food poisoning</a>, itself in response to the recent pet food poisonings. The post includes data from the CDC on the rate of foodborne disease outbreaks from the CDC, which seems to indicate a peak in 2000 and a decline in recent years. Presumably the data is accurate. So what&#8217;s responsible for the improvements in food safety? Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan sends along this little Editorial from the St. Petersburg Times about <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/23/Opinion/Private_troubles__pub.shtml">privatization in Florida</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In pulling the plug on an $89-million accounting system disaster, Florida Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink has delivered a potent message to those who do business with the state: Get the work done right, on time and on budget, or be gone.</p>
<p>Private companies can and often do perform valuable work for government, but the failed &#8220;Project Aspire&#8221; is a case study in how wholesale privatization can run amok.</p>
<p>The state set out to integrate all of its accounting systems so it could track every transaction from every agency. Three years later, it has spent $89-million with little to show for it. The primary contractor, BearingPoint, has already left the job. It blames bureaucrats for constantly changing their minds. Bureaucrats blame lawmakers for changing the funding. Meanwhile, the state still uses its old accounting methods.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This may be the first of more to come. Project Aspire is one of three major privatization projects begun during the tenure of former Gov. Jeb Bush and shielded from oversight. People First, a nine-year, $350-million agreement with Convergys Corp. to privatize personnel services, is at least as problem-plagued as the BearingPoint venture. A legislative analysis last year reported that 21 state agencies still kept paper files because they didn&#8217;t trust People First. One agency was forced to increase its human resource budget by $1.3-million to cope with the new system.</p>
<p>Bush once vetoed a legislative attempt to review the contracts, but Sink and Gov. Charlie Crist have committed to holding the businesses accountable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all for privatization,&#8221; Crist said in response to the Project Aspire action, &#8220;but only if it benefits the taxpayer and it&#8217;s done with integrity. &#8230; If it&#8217;s bad, get out and stop the waste.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Dan follows this up with a series of very naive questions: </p>
<blockquote><p>Why would anyone spend $350 or $89 million with no oversight? Anyone! How is efficiency even inserted into the project? How does any privatizing proponent let this happen or not blow the whistle? Does it not hurt the cause? </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers may recall that most of my income these days comes from building statistical models for use by the military NASA.  But I do a bit of telecom work too and I&#8217;d be interested in doing some political consulting.  One thing that comes up now and then is the opportunity to do a project for a small company.  It doesn&#8217;t happen often &#8211; small companies rarely realize someone can help them by running numbers.</p>
<p>This afternoon I met a very nice guy &#8211; the guy who printed out my wedding invitations.  I never met him before since the Ex-GF took care of all of those details.  Anyway, he&#8217;s been in business for 25 years, and seen the business change dramatically.   (One detail of which I was unaware &#8211; a lot of the big printing jobs are outsourced to&#8230; the Netherlands?!?)  As kind of a not-unrelated aside, he has a computer system that compiles all his invoices into a nice summary format, but he&#8217;d have to pay another $700 to buy the module that allows it all to be exported into Excel in non-summary format.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to look over the summary information and decide what services I can offer him and make a proposal.  His costs would be my fee plus $700 to buy the module.</p>
<p>My thought process&#8230; and I haven&#8217;t looked at the data carefully yet, nor had time to digest everything I&#8217;ve heard, plus I&#8217;m just thinking aloud so to speak (so to write)&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  The big jobs get outsourced<br />2.  In terms of medium sized and small jobs, he has one thing that differentiates him.  A brand new piece of equipment ($80K) that does some nifty digital copying.  Most other printers don&#8217;t have that equipment yet.  <br />3.  But I wonder how long item 2 will be true.  Put another way&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what he can do to differentiate himself, and competing on price is alone is never a good idea.<br />4.  Its a mature industry&#8230; costs to consumers have dropped tremendously in the past five years.<br />5.  He&#8217;s thinking of hiring a company to do some marketing for him.</p>
<p>So where does that leave a printer like the gentleman I met this afternoon?  Well, my off-the-top-of-the-head thought is that perhaps I cannot help him by running numbers.  I have little doubt I can build a nice interactive model for him that computes his costs to the penny for each project, computes demand elasticities, and proposes the best possible price to charge customers for any given job.  I&#8217;ve done it before for other clients.  But perhaps at this point what he needs is advice.  Perhaps, as he joked, it is time to try to sell the business, and perhaps next week that will be the conclusion I will have reached when I call him with a proposal.  (I.e., I would proopse that he not waste his money hiring me, but instead try to sell the business.)</p>
<p>But perhaps there is something that can be done to turn around the business.  It occurs to me that while competing on price with other printers is a loser&#8217;s game, competing on price with people&#8217;s imagination might not be.  Most people don&#8217;t realize how much prices have dropped for printing services &#8211; informing them of this might drive some business.  </p>
<p>But what else is there?  What should someone in his position do?</p>

<p>David is correct.  When discussing our current account deficit, the biggest issue is our low national savings rate, which is partly being driven by our fiscal recklessness.  If Matthew Slaughter had written the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the Chinese Central Bank were a small part of the story, he would have been correct.  Our problem is that his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117980288989610442.html">WSJ oped</a> suggested that these policies had no effect.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the &#8220;minor curiosity&#8221; file: A report from Switzerland, the acknowledged masters of banknote printing, concludes that it&#8217;s unlikely that North Korea is the source of the counterfeit &#8220;supernotes&#8221; that have been circulating around the world for the past few years. But <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/17264993.htm">there&#8217;s also this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, analysts have wondered why the supernotes — which are detectable only with sophisticated, expensive technology — appear to have been produced in quantities less than it would cost to acquire the sophisticated machinery needed to make them&#8230;..&#8221;What defies logic is the limited, or even controlled, amount of &#8216;exclusive&#8217; fakes that have appeared over the years. The organization could easily circulate tenfold that amount without raising suspicions,&#8221; says the Swiss police report, which also says Switzerland has seized 5 percent of all known supernotes.</p>
<p>Moreover, it noted that the manufacturer of the supernotes had issued 19 different versions, an &#8220;enormous effort&#8221; that only a criminal organization or state could undertake. The updates closely tracked the changes in U.S. currency issued by the Federal Reserve Bank.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  I play with a lot of a data.  Its been my experience that if the results are just flat crazy, and don&#8217;t fit any reasonable scenario, when you go back and check the data its wrong.  My guess&#8230; there are a heck of a lot of fake dollars out there, somewhere.  They&#8217;re either not in use right now, or they are in use, and not being detected.  Which makes them equivalent to the real thing.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Pew Research Center did <a href="http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=329">survey of Muslim Americans</a>. I won&#8217;t comment on the bulk of it &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you can get plenty of commentary elsewhere. What I find extremely interesting is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just 40% of Muslim Americans say groups of Arabs carried out those [September 11] attacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that behavior of various population groups go in waves. In the 1990s, it was almost stylish to be a militia member. After the Republican Revolution, actual militia members were invited to testify about some of their, um, grievances to Congress. I can&#8217;t speak for all of them, but some of these folks were just plain unadulterated crazy. They believed that Black helicopters were flying around spying on US citizens, and that foreign military powers had military bases on US soil. Some of them believed that the Queen of England owns the Federal Reserve, and/or that a group of Jews run the world. For many of the militia folks, the attention from Oklahoma City and having their people testifying before Congress fed on itself, and the militia movement grew.</p>
<p>In recent years, militias have become less a part of the public arena. But Islamic militants have taken their place. And right after 9/11, among those that were so inclined, it was a time to imitate. The 15 year old kid who crashed a Cessna into a building in Tampa after voicing support for Osama was, predictably, an Arab American, just as a kid that looked up to Tim McVeigh or Eric Rudolph and started trecking through the woods and torturing small animals in the late 1990s would have been, predictably, a Caucasian Christian.  (And by this I don&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s a believer in Christianity, just as its quite possible many violent Muslims are not real Muslims.  I would prefer not to have this post degenerate into a discussion of that issue.)  The folks that went to Afghanistan to train (and train for what, if not to fight against those that Osama felt were enemies &#8211; i.e., us) likewise. As were the bombers in London and Bali and Madrid and so forth.</p>
<p>I wonder about this dual tendency by groups, to both claim credit for an act and to pretend no involvement, both at the same time. Of course, no group &#8211; not Caucasian Christians after Oklahoma City, not Muslim Americans after 9/11, is monolithic, and the folks claiming credit may not be the same folks that say no member of the group was involved. Consider, in some number of years, no doubt there will be another incident. That incident will probably involve another group &#8211; some group that we haven&#8217;t begun to grow suspicious of yet. Korean-Americans, Quakers, South Dakotans, philatelists, whatever. Whichever group it happens to be, there will be some members of the group denying that any members of the group were involved, while fully aware that many other members of the group (perhaps mostly the young) not only take pride in that incident, but are being recruited into extremist organizations on the strength of that incident. And I wonder if its the wisest course of action, or if its the kind of thing to create even more animosity and resentment among the rest of the population.</p>

                                <p>A few stories out at Steve Benen&#8217;s place&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10882.html">First</a>, a link to Wired Magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/05/military_dragge.html">Danger Room</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Marine Corps waited over a year before acting on an &#8220;priority 1 urgent&#8221; request to send blast-resistant vehicles to Iraq&#8230; the request for over 1,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles came in February, 2005.  A formal call to fulfill that order did not emerge until November, 2006.   &#8220;There is an immediate need for an MRAP vehicle capability to increase survivability and mobility of Marines operating in a hazardous fire area against known threats,&#8221; the 2005 &#8220;universal need statement&#8221; notes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long story short&#8230; the military claims the capability to produce the items wasn&#8217;t there.  The story closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is what happens when industry isn&#8217;t put on a war footing,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the military families are at war, and everyone else is out shopping.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But then, I do recall GW saying something about us all going shopping after 9/11.</p>
<p>And then <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10876.html">this post</a> linking to <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/05/us_government_g.html">this ABC News story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Al Hurra television, the U.S. government&#8217;s $63 million-a-year effort at public diplomacy broadcasting in the Middle East, is run by executives and officials who cannot speak Arabic, according to a senior official who oversees the program.</p>
<p>That might explain why critics say the service has recently been caught broadcasting terrorist messages, including an hour-long tirade on the importance of anti-Jewish violence, among other questionable pieces.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots&#8230;  (sorry about writing out &#8220;three dots&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;ve found that simply three dots placed between paragraphs are hard to see)</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, the network&#8217;s news division also had no assignment desk, he said. That left decisions over al Hurra&#8217;s content in the hands of its reporters and producers, who are, according to Blaya, hastily-hired Arabic-speaking journalists with insufficient understanding of Western journalistic practices or the network&#8217;s pro-Western mission. </p></blockquote>
<p>three more dots&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The station&#8217;s gaffes have included broadcasting in December 2006 a 68-minute call to arms against Israelis by a senior figure of the terrorist group Hezbollah; deferential coverage of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#8217;s Holocaust denial conference; and a factually flawed piece on a splinter group of Orthodox Jews who oppose the state of Israel, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has reported the network&#8217;s travails for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve Benen also notes that  &#8220;Al Hurra is a project of the administration’s Broadcasting Board of Governors, which is led by Ken Tomlinson.&#8221;  Steve has posted on Tomlinson before&#8230; it seems the State Department inspector general found that he &#8220;had repeatedly used government employees to perform personal errands and that he billed the government for more days of work than the rules permit.&#8221;  Additionally, in 2005, he was caught breaking the Federal Broadcasting Act.  The US Attorney&#8217;s Office (yeah, that one) was provided with all this information, but declined to prosecute him.  (If he wasn&#8217;t a Bush appointee, would they have declined to prosecute?)  All of which allowed him to move onto bigger and better things.  Like providing a venue for anti-Semitism to flourish, at US taxpayer expense.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fact 1: China runs a large and growing trade surplus with the United States. In 2006, the goods-trade surplus exceeded $232 billion. This was an increase from 2005 of $31 billion, an amount larger than the entire deficit just 12 years ago. Fact 2: China focuses its monetary policy on fixing the exchange value of its currency, the yuan, relative to the U.S. dollar. Many policymakers and pundits connect these two facts by asserting that an unfairly low value of the dollar-yuan peg is causing the massive bilateral trade imbalance. The 109th Congress introduced 27 pieces of anti-China trade legislation. &#8230; These misgivings about the dollar-yuan peg are misplaced. Economic theory and data are very clear here on two critical points. Controlling a nominal exchange rate is a form of sovereign monetary policy. And monetary policy, in turn, has no long-run effect on real economic outcomes such as output and trade flows.</p></blockquote>
<p>That <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/05/slaughter-on-yuan.html">Greg Mankiw</a> approves this is no surprise, but <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/05/focus_on_yuan_m.html">Mark Thoma</a> was also in agreement.  Sorry fellows – but time to turn the microphone over to <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2007/05/aaaargh-slaughter-on-china.html">KNZN</a>.  OK, sorry about his screaming Aaargh, but continue to listen anyway:</p>
<blockquote><p>What the People’s Bank of China is doing is something quite different. Even as it maintains its effective dollar peg, it is attempting to cool the economy by raising interest rates. It is not controlling “one nominal price”; rather, it is attempting (with limited success) to control two things at once. It is trying to keep exports strong by keeping the currency weak, and at the same time, it is trying to reduce domestic demand by tightening domestic monetary policy. As a result, it is accumulating a huge, huge, huge quantity of dollar-denominated assets, and this rate of accumulation is clear evidence of a policy conflict.  The conflict might be a bit more obvious if things were going in the other direction. If China were trying to peg the yuan too high rather than too low, while at the same time trying to stimulate, rather than cool, its domestic economy, it would be losing reserves rapidly. The process couldn’t continue, because it would run out of reserves. Then it would be forced either to abandon the peg or to tighten the domestic money supply dramatically. Because the process is now going in the opposite direction, there is no “crisis”, but otherwise what we are seeing is the exact inverse of conditions that would normally have led to a foreign exchange crisis. Of course, when a country does have a foreign exchange crisis, we don’t read economists saying that it is just “sovereign monetary policy” and nothing to worry about. When the process happens in reverse, though, apparently central banks can find plenty of apologists for their unsavory policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole policy debate is over China’s beggar-thy-neighbor Central Bank mercantilism that has caused its real exchange rate to be “too low”.  The rationale for those trade protection proposals in Congress is to have our own beggar-thy-neighbor policies.  While I would prefer that we rely on exchange rate realignment as opposed to trade protection, it seems two former members of Bush’s CEA are either ignorant of the real issue here – or choosing to ignore them.  </p>
<p>In fairness, an exchange rate realignment is going to have only a small dent in our current account deficit unless we choose to also reverse the Bush fiscal fiasco which has lowered our national savings rate.  I’m not holding my breathe for these two former Bush advisors to hammer their former boss on fiscal policy – but I will scream out a plea to our friend Mark Thoma not to go so soft on Slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDlhZDdkNTg3Y2JhYjcwZTQ5ZDY4ZTMzYThlYmE5M2I=">James Dorn</a> is supposed to be a China specialist at Cato, which must explain his confusion here:</p>
<blockquote><p>the balance of payments must always balance because of double-entry bookkeeping.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Mr. Dorn thinks China has a policy of freely floating exchange.  And I thought Slaughter was ignorant on the basics of this issue!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/05/does_chinas_exc.html">Brad DeLong</a> suggests that Lord Keynes and Milton Friedman join the vowel-less economist blogger brigade in also screaming Aaaargh from their graves.  Brads adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s frustrating: Matthew Slaughter&#8217;s assertions are based on his assumption that full long-run monetary and price-level adjustment has already taken place, yet the pace and magnitude of Chiana&#8217;s reserve accumulation (and Japan&#8217;s) are very strong signs that the PBoC and the BoJ are blocking monetary and price-level adjustment&#8211;and that is the problem. To state that if we assume that the problem doesn&#8217;t exist then we conclude we don&#8217;t have a problem is just not very helpful. And not one in a hundred readers of the WSJ op-ed page will be able to diagnose just how Slaughter&#8217;s piece is a misleading tautology.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is frustrating to see a former member of the CEA writing something fit only for the National Review or the WSJ oped pages.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve had a few posts comparing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">performance in various series by presidential administration</a>. As a general rule, in most of the series I looked at, Democratic Presidents have done better than Republican Presidents, JFK/LBJ and Clinton have better than Carter, and Reagan has done better than the other Republicans. Among the exceptions was my last post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median income</a>, in which JFK/LBJ and Clinton led the pack, but Carter brought up the rear.</p>
<p>Some readers have said that one cannot read much into the results of all these series, that they do not, in fact, show that Democrats do a better job at these measures than Republicans. These readers tend to want to vote Republican, and they insist that most of a President’s policies have long lag times, so their effects may not even show while a President is in office.</p>
<p>And to some extent, they’re right. For instance, to use a little publicized piece of policy… when GW (temporarily) retired the 30 year bond in 2001, he in effect prevented the country from locking in the very, very low rates that prevailed until the 30 year bond was reinstated. This will result in higher interest payments, probably for decades to come. Similarly, abstinence only programs – children not having the benefit of sex ed are likely to have unexpected and unwanted pregnancies with all the problems that entails, including abortions, as much as 30 years later.</p>
<p>But most of a President’s policies have a much more immediate effect. And most people who insist on the long lag explanation believe that too – most of them are quick to credit the performance of the economy in the last few years (though, I would imagine, not in the last quarter) to the President’s tax cuts in 2003. And they are quick to credit Reagan for turning the country around – early in the Reagan administration, not during the GHW administration. (Though if one reads the National Review or Clown Hall, one can sometimes find examples where they credit Reagan for everything good that happened in the Clinton years.) </p>
<p>Furthermore, I’ve had posts looking at the correlation between deficit spending and growth, and between taxes and growth. The correlations are there, and they kick in very quickly.</p>
<p>But in the end, the big problem with the lag theory is that the length of the lag magically changes. If Republicans are responsible for the growth during Democratic admnistrations, and vice versa, how do we account for the poor performance of GHW in almost every measure? Did Reagan’s virtues only begin to kick in 4 years after he left office? And why didn’t that happen with Ike, or Nixon/Ford, both of whom were followed by Presidents that outperformed them on most measures? </p>
<p>Similarly, if Reagan had to struggle to build things up after Carter… why did GHW have the same struggle? And if it took Carter only four years to screw things up, why wasn’t that true of the other Democratic administrations? Why didn’t things hit the proverbial fan from 1965 to 1968, or from 1996 to 2000? </p>
<p>And then there is one other problem. To which President would the lag proponents credit the performance during the Reagan administration? Carter? Nixon &#038; Ford? Or does it go back farther, to LBJ? I think none of the above. They will tell you that Reagan was the one that made things the way they were in the Reagan administration, at least the good thing. (I’ve seen the Reagan deficits blamed on Congress many a time.) </p>
<p>I don’t buy the lag story at all. If the data shows that things generally went better in Democratic administrations, its either because God doesn’t like it when we vote Republican, or because Democratic Presidents have followed better policies. Take your pick.</p>
