<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=05&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=is_the_post_prohibited_from_ma#016699">Dean Baker</a> wishes the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">Washington Post</a> knew how to put budget numbers in context:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article briefly recounts the trend in NiH funding over the last decade and points out that the 2008 appropriation is $28.9 billion.   It would have been far more informative to readers if the article had pointed out that NIH appropriation is equal to approximately 1.0 percent of federal spending or $97 per person.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is worth a read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stanford University biochemist Roger D. Kornberg won a Nobel Prize last year for work he began in the 1970s, but he is pretty sure that if he had been born a generation later, he never would have had the chance. The scientist, 60, is convinced that his groundbreaking research, in which he figured out how information in the DNA of a gene is copied to provide instructions for building and running a living cell, would never have gotten the necessary funding support in today&#8217;s tight budget environment at the National Institutes of Health. … Congress nearly doubled NIH&#8217;s budget &#8211; to $27.1 billion between 1998 and 2003 &#8211; as officials sought to capitalize on new lines of research opened up by the Human Genome Project. Medical schools and other research institutions responded accordingly, adding faculty and beginning construction on new facilities. At the same time, the number of grant applications rose 44 percent, from 24,151 in 1998 to 34,710 in 2003.  But eventually the flood of new cash slowed to a trickle. At $28 billion, the NIH&#8217;s fiscal budget for 2004 was only 3.3 percent higher than the previous year&#8217;s. President Bush has recommended $28.9 billion for fiscal 2008 &#8211; $379 million less than the NIH got this year, according to agency figures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows NIH funding as a percent of GDP from 1977 to 2006.  Before 1993, this ratio has remained below 0.15%.  The ratio peaked at 0.247% as of 2003.  Since then, the share of national income going to the NIH has declined.  The article ends by noting that some Democrats think we should increase funding for the NIH.</p>

                                <p>Steve Benen has a few posts up apropos of the Memorial Day weekend. <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10932.html">First up</a> is a post that links to this link to <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10932.html">NY Times</a> story about Delta Company of the First Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division, stationed in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>But now on his third deployment in Iraq, he is no longer a believer in the mission. The pivotal moment came, he says, this past February when soldiers killed a man setting a roadside bomb. When they searched the bomber’s body, they found identification showing him to be a sergeant in the Iraqi Army. </p>
<p>“I thought, ‘What are we doing here? Why are we still here?’ ” said Sergeant Safstrom, a member of Delta Company of the First Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division. “We’re helping guys that are trying to kill us. We help them in the day. They turn around at night and try to kill us.” </p>
<p>His views are echoed by most of his fellow soldiers in Delta Company, renowned for its aggressiveness. </p>
<p>A small minority of Delta Company soldiers — the younger, more recent enlistees in particular — seem to still wholeheartedly support the war. Others are ambivalent, torn between fear of losing more friends in battle, longing for their families and a desire to complete their mission.</p>
<p>With few reliable surveys of soldiers’ attitudes, it is impossible to simply extrapolate from the small number of soldiers in Delta Company. But in interviews with more than a dozen soldiers over a one-week period with this 83-man unit, most said they were disillusioned by repeated deployments, by what they saw as the abysmal performance of Iraqi security forces and by a conflict that they considered a civil war, one they had no ability to stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the battle was over, Delta Company learned that among the enemy dead were at least two Iraqi Army soldiers that American forces had helped train and arm. </p>
<p>“The 29th was a watershed moment in a negative sense, because the Iraqi Army would not fight with us,” Captain Rogers said, adding, “Some actually picked up weapons and fought against us.”</p>
<p>The battle changed the attitude among his soldiers toward the war, he said. </p>
<p>“Before that fight, there were a few true believers.” Captain Rogers said. “After the 29th, I don’t think you’ll find a true believer in this unit. They’re paratroopers. There’s no question they’ll fulfill their mission. But they’re fighting now for pride in their unit, professionalism, loyalty to their fellow soldier and chain of command.”</p>
<p>To Sergeant O’Flarity, the Iraqi security forces are militias beholden to local leaders, not the Iraqi government. “Half of the Iraqi security forces are insurgents,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying for a while, a big difference between Iraq and Vietnam is that our supposed allies weren&#8217;t shooting at American troops in their spare time.</p>
<p>Its worth reading both Benen&#8217;s post and the NY Times article.</p>
<p>Benen goes on with this post about <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10930.html">Blackwater</a>. It seems that recently Blackwater employees in Iraq have gotten into at least two firefights last week. Details are fuzzy in both. In one, an Iraqi driver was shot dead. In another, a Blackwater convoy had a tense standoff with Iraqi Interior Ministry forces, which only ended when a US Military convoy intervened <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5048766">according to the Washington Post</a>. I wonder form that intervention took.</p>
<p>The Washington Post also has another interesting tidbit&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Interior Ministry officials said Blackwater has not applied to operate as a private security company in Iraq. That process has been completed by several security firms with U.S. government contracts, including ArmorGroup International and Aegis Defense Services, two British companies.</p>
<p>Tyrrell wrote that Blackwater is &#8220;working lawfully in Iraq,&#8221; adding, &#8220;We comply with all contractual obligations, including obtaining all appropriate registrations in the very dynamic environment in Iraq whose requirements for registration and licensing are always evolving.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way&#8230; the Iraqis don&#8217;t seem to think that Blackwater is in their country legally, but the company is clearly there at the request of the American government. Seems kind of an odd situation for a sovereign country.</p>
<p>And another thing&#8230; (as one of Steve Benen&#8217;s commentators asks): are Blackwater employees readily identifiable as not being American troops? Somehow, I doubt it. In the minds of the average Iraqi, when they see something done by a Blackwater employee, they automatically assume its done by &#8220;Americans.&#8221;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post looks at disposable income by presidential administration – as usual, there’s a graph and a table.  (I wasn’t going to do it, as noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/disposable-personal-income-personal.html">here</a>, but I was convinced otherwise by reader’s comments.)  </p>
<p>Disposable personal income data is available from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=58&#038;FirstYear=2005&#038;LastYear=2007&#038;Freq=Qtr">BEA’s NIPA Table 2.1</a>.  It seems to be income of all types, including wage income, rental income, receipts from government, and employer contributions to social security, just to name a few.  It subtracts off things like one’s own contributions to social security and personal taxes.  </p>
<p>Consider –the government can drive up disposable personal income in any given year simply by cutting taxes (after tax income rises) and/or spending more money (unless the government simply burns the money, government spending is necessarily income for someone).  But my fellow Angry Bear PGL is always repeating Milton Friedman’s immortal words:  to spend is to tax.  If the government runs a deficit, that may boost things in the short run, but it drives up our long term obligations.  We need to take that into account somehow.</p>
<p>(As an analogy – if you run up your credit card, you can’t consider your purchases to be income.  But if the government runs up its credit card, it is considered income.)  </p>
<p>So… the honest way to look at real disposable personal income is to also subtract off the increase in each person’s future tax obligation throughout the year.  </p>
<p>So… the graph below shows the real disposable personal income less the change in the Federal Debt per person in 2000 dollars.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlsRCSSzD9I/AAAAAAAAANQ/HcmXymvrIzU/s1600-h/real+disposable+income+less+change+in+real+debt+per+capita,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlsRCSSzD9I/AAAAAAAAANQ/HcmXymvrIzU/s320/real+disposable+income+less+change+in+real+debt+per+capita,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The Table below summarizes the results, showing the annual percentage change in the series under each President.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlsQ7iSzD8I/AAAAAAAAANI/39Hga7YXKuc/s1600-h/real+disposable+income+less+change+in+real+debt+per+capita.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RlsQ7iSzD8I/AAAAAAAAANI/39Hga7YXKuc/s320/real+disposable+income+less+change+in+real+debt+per+capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As with a large number of series we’ve looked at already here at Angry Bear, the top 3 slots go to the Democratic administrations, and the bottom 5 go to the Republican administrations.  Remind me again why anyone buys into this supply side nonsense.</p>
<p>OK.  Now another thing.  Call it an editorial comment.  This matters.  The difference between Republican and Democratic performance is important.  Perhaps you’re a devout Republican, and you’re thinking…  well, OK, so Republicans don’t do all that well on the economy, but I like Ronnie so I’m gonna vote for Mitt Romney ‘cause he’s just like the Gipper.  What harm can it do?</p>
<p>Well, let’s look at Reagan’s performance… he was the best of the Republicans by this (and a number of other measures).  Before we begin, note that in 1952, the year before Ike took office, real disposable income less the change in real debt per person in year 2000 dollars was $8,981, as shown in the above graph.  In 2006, it was $27,634.</p>
<p>Now, say Reagan’s Republican-best 2.26% annual growth rate had been maintained throughout the entire sample.  In that case, by 2006, the real disposable income less the change in real debt per person would be at $30,069.  Thus, at the same level debt, we’d have, on average, more real disposable income.  Or, we’d have the same real disposable income on average, but less debt.  Or, more likely, some combination of the two.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good, huh?  The miracle of compound interest and all that good stuff. </p>
<p>Now what if the growth rate achieved during the JFK/LBJ years – the worst performance by any of the Democrats in the sample – had been maintained throughout the entire period?  By 2006, we’d have $45,059.  Almost 50% more.  In 54 years.  Carter, of course, did even better, and Clinton better still; at $55,507 its not enough to lap Reagan, but its coming up on the stretch.  </p>
<p>Consider the difference between $27,634 that we actually observed, and $45,059 – what we could have achieved with JFK/LBJ’s annualized rates.  That money could have bought real things, and made real people better off.  It could have bought food and medicine, extended lives, created jobs.  How much better things could be if people voted for candidates that support real growth and fiscal responsibility.  </p>

<p>Methodology notes…<br />Note…  data on the Federal Debt was obtained from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">White House OMB Table 7.1</a>.  Because the data is for the end of the fiscal year (which ran through June until 1976, and until September in subsequent years), and the disposable income is provided quarterly, I used 2nd quarter real disposable personal income per capita through 1976 and 3rd quarter thereafter.  In addition, I adjusted using the average of 12 consecutive months’ CPI-U <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI-U</a> to compute inflation.  To match the other series, the twelve months ended in June for years through 1976, and in September for years thereafter.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded the series &#8211; real disposable income less change in debt obligations per pserson &#8211; what a mouthful &#8211; into <a href="http://www.swivel.com/data_sets/show/1006034">Swivel</a>, as per suggestions by reader Mcwop.  If you want my spreadsheets showing the step by step computation, let me know.</p>
<p>FWIW&#8230; I&#8217;m not happy about this approach.  I have to see what it takes to make the spreadsheets downloadable from my own website.  My anonimity will be disappearing soon anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>There is a lag in the Q&#038;A process on blogs, and it seems that Hormats, or more likely his publicist, has come up with a clever way to deal with it. How would you do it?</p>

                                <p>Sadly, I&#8217;m working today. So I took a break from work, and on a lark, looked up Victor Davis Hanson. </p>
<p>He <a href="http://victordavishanson.pajamasmedia.com/2007/05/19/not_with_a_bang.php">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I support globalization, and see that at its essence it is Westernization, and that bright people make the world better by allowing an exhange [sic] of ideas and life-saving appurtenances. But I want no part of the necessary globalized CEO, who believes in nothing, says nothing, knows nothing other than a sort of adolescent watered-down Gorism. Every MBA program should have one, just one introductory class in Western Civ to introduce to these historically illiterate that the basis for their present globalized system was the West, so that they might not so often preen that it was cobbled together from the Middle East, the Orient, Africa, in some sort of alaphabet [sic] soup concoction.</p></blockquote>
<p>From this, we learn that Hanson feels that business school grads don&#8217;t know much about history, and as a result of that, believe in nothing, say nothing, yadda yadda yadda, a couple more yaddas thrown in for good measure, and maybe one more yadda, no take back that last yadda, it was too many, but preen (in this context, does that involve belief?) that the &#8220;present globalized system&#8221; was &#8220;cobbled together from the Middle East, the Orient, Africa.&#8221; </p>
<p>I would remind readers that it <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/josh-marshall-notes-that-recently.html">wasn&#8217;t long ago</a> that we here at Angry Bear had occasion to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702046.html">quote Hanson</a> ourselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>The war is not lost &#8212; no more than it was in winter 1776, July 1864, December 1945 or November 1950. The challenge is winning back hearts and minds at home, rather than in Iraq, where brave thousands join us each day to fight an evil sort the likes of which we haven&#8217;t seen in recent memory.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I noted at the time, this amounts to stating that the low point in the Civil War came a few months after the Declaration of Independence, the low point in the Civil War came right before Sherman began cutting a swath of terror through Georgia and Grant was cutting off Petersberg, and most obviously, the low point in World War 2 came a third of a year after the war ended. He is more or less right about Korea, but from what I&#8217;ve read, things probably looked bleakest in Korea in December 1950, not November. Since Hanson is in the ballpark on this one, I shouldn&#8217;t quibble.</p>
<p>So why would Hanson complain that B-school grads are historically illiterate. It seems being historically illiterate doesn&#8217;t stop some people from earning a good living as a military historian.</p>

                                <p>While <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/05/turnabout.html">Greg Mankiw</a> is a late comer to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/china-peg-putting-things-in-perspective.html">this controversy</a>, he has some very smart things to say.  </p>
<blockquote><p>I would not argue that Chinese policy is incapable of affecting the real exchange rate. In a world of imperfect capital mobility, Chinese policy can affect international capital flows and thus the real exchange rate that equilibrates trade in goods and capital. But I am skeptical that their policy intervention is adverse to broad American interests. What the Chinese are doing, to boil it down to its essence, is buying U.S. government bonds (and some other American assets). The U.S. government is in the business of selling these bonds. There is no good reason to object when a willing buyer steps into the market &#8230; The more difficult question is whether the Chinese are acting against their own self-interest by saving so much and investing in foreign assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg directs our attention to the larger issues, which relate to the fact that the Chinese have a high national savings rate while we have a very low national savings rate.  I do have a few small quibbles with his close:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before you say, &#8220;They are stealing our jobs,&#8221; let me point out two things. First, while some jobs are lost to import competition, other jobs are gained because of lower interest rates and greater investment spending that capital inflows finance. Second, the U.S. unemployment rate is now low by historical standards. Based on either theory or evidence, the canonical political refrain of &#8220;jobs, jobs, jobs&#8221; makes little sense in this debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The (ab)use of “unemployment rate is now low by historical standards” strikes me as a poor way of judging whether we are near full employment or not.  With that said – I tend to look at these issues in terms of long-term effects so let me agree with Gregs premise that &#8220;jobs, jobs, jobs&#8221; is not part of the debate as to the long-run impacts of our pathetically low national savings rate versus the high savings of China.  The other quibble comes here: “greater investment spending that capital inflows finance”.  We are not investing a lot as a nation.  OK, what little we are investing is financed by borrowing from abroad.  But that’s precisely the point about our low national savings rate.  Which is why I like Greg’s opening:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose the U.S. President were to propose the following policy: &#8220;My fellow Americans, I have just asked the Congress to increase taxes on all of us. After they pass my tax increase, I will instruct the Treasury to lend the additional tax revenue to the government of China.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg thinks Americans would oppose this proposal.  But let’s try a little rewriting based on the real situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>My fellow Americans, I have asked Congress to set current taxes at a level to cover our austere budget proposals.  This way we won’t have to continue borrow from the government of China placing our children and grandchildren in their debt.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18881810/site/newsweek">Michael Isikoff and Evan Thomas</a> takes us back to the Watergate coverup:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Justice Department is supposed to stand for the rule of law &#8211; to be the enforcer of the laws of the United States, not the place presidents go to get around the law. Independence is an important tradition in the columned limestone building on Constitution Avenue. It is worth remembering that before Richard Nixon could find someone at the Justice Department willing to fire the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973, he had to accept the resignations of the attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus. (Solicitor General Robert Bork finally did the deed.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Bork indeed was willing to sell out principles – just as Alberto Gonzales has been.  But just as credit went to Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus back then, credit should go to John Aschroft and James Comey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back at the Justice Department, there is an equally extraordinary scene. Appalled by the White House&#8217;s heavy-handed attempt to coerce the gravely ill attorney general, virtually the entire top leadership of the Justice Department is threatening to resign. The group includes the director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, Associate Attorney General Robert McCallum and the chief of the Criminal Division, Chris Wray. Some of them gather in the conference room of Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who describes Ashcroft&#8217;s bravely turning away the president&#8217;s men from his hospital bed. The mood that night in the conference room was tense &#8211; and sober. &#8220;This was a showdown,&#8221; says a former senior Justice Department official who was there. &#8220;Everybody understood the choice they were making and the gravity of the situation. Everybody knew what the stakes were.&#8221; A different source estimated that as many as 30 top DOJ officials would have resigned.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues discussing the testimony of Monica Goodling but then turns on John Yoo:</p>
<blockquote><p>The trouble began shortly after 9/11, when the administration began looking for tough measures to head off another terrorist attack. The Justice Department has a relatively obscure department known as the Office of Legal Counsel. Typically staffed by brilliant young lawyers, the OLC opines on the legality and constitutionality of administration policies. One of the stars of OLC was a cocky young lawyer named John Yoo. After 9/11, Yoo began writing opinions giving the administration exceptional latitude to fight terrorism. Yoo&#8217;s memos were used to justify both the secret eavesdropping program, which for the first time allowed the government to listen in on American citizens without obtaining a court warrant, and aggressive interrogation methods, like water boarding.  While easygoing and congenial on the surface, Yoo was a fierce bureaucratic infighter with a penchant for circumventing his superiors. Though all the top officials at Justice were conservative Republicans, Yoo seemed to regard them as political dolts. &#8220;He had this calm, unruffled, almost &#8216;devil may care&#8217; attitude when he talked about issues that were extraordinarily sensitive,&#8221; recalled a former Justice Department official. &#8220;He would sort of come flying by your office and say things like, &#8216;We&#8217;ve done a little analysis, it&#8217;s no big deal&#8217;.&#8221; Only later, the official said, would he discover that Yoo had sent the White House an opinion authorizing some sweeping new &#8211; and constitutionally dubious &#8211; program. Yoo was increasingly seen as a rogue operator inside the Justice Department. Officials were suspicious of his ties to David Addington, counsel to Vice President Cheney. The vice president&#8217;s office took a hard-line view that the executive branch should not be trammeled in the war on terror by legislators and bureaucrats. Yoo was &#8220;out of control,&#8221; recalled a former Ashcroft aide. Almost without exception, this conflict stayed behind closed doors. (Yoo declined to respond on the record, but he has told others that Ashcroft was fully briefed by him and approved his memos, and that his critics are now engaged in creative &#8220;Monday-morning quarterbacking.&#8221;) The bad feelings seemed to come to a head in 2003, when there was a vacancy to head OLC. At the White House, Gonzales wanted Yoo, and was so insistent that he took the matter to Bush. According to the former Ashcroft aide who did not want to openly discuss matters involving the president, Bush was surprised to learn that Ashcroft opposed Yoo as a renegade. A compromise was reached: a conservative lawyer named Jack Goldsmith was put in charge of OLC. But the fight was really just beginning. Carefully reviewing Yoo&#8217;s carte blanche memos, Goldsmith became convinced that the Justice Department had been signing off on memos approving initiatives, like wiretapping and water boarding, that were not legally supportable. Goldsmith took the matter to Ashcroft&#8217;s deputy, Comey, and to Patrick Philbin, Comey&#8217;s No. 2. Philbin&#8217;s sterling conservative legal résumé tracked Yoo&#8217;s &#8211; they had both clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas at the U.S. Supreme Court. But Philbin and Goldsmith were adamant. The Justice Department could no longer sign off on the wiretapping program, which had been expanded to wiretap more U.S. residents. &#8220;This was not ideological,&#8221; recalled a former Ashcroft aide. &#8220;This was about the difference between pushing the limits to the edge of the line and crossing the line.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How involved was President Bush in supporting Yoo’s agenda?  This story says it is not clear.  What is clear is that this battle between the Aschroft camp that wanted Justice to actually do its job and the Gonzales that wanted to give King George free reign is why we ended up with Gonzales as Attorney General.  We had the common sense to force the resignations of Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon over 30 years ago.  So why do Dick Cheney and George Bush still hold their positions of power?</p>

                                <blockquote><p>Months before the invasion of Iraq, U.S. intelligence agencies predicted that it would be likely to spark violent sectarian divides and provide al-Qaeda with new opportunities in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a report released yesterday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Analysts warned that war in Iraq also could provoke Iran to assert its regional influence and &#8220;probably would result in a surge of political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups&#8221; in the Muslim world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Iraq invasion might help Iran and Al Qaeda?!  That’s why I thought we should not invade Iraq.  Too bad our intelligence agencies failed to inform the President.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/25/AR2007052501380.html">Oh wait</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The intelligence assessments, made in January 2003 and widely circulated within the Bush administration before the war, said that establishing democracy in Iraq would be &#8220;a long, difficult and probably turbulent challenge.&#8221; The assessments noted that Iraqi political culture was &#8220;largely bereft of the social underpinnings&#8221; to support democratic development.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bush knew this was a really bad idea from a policy perspective – and yet he did it anyway.  Then again – it did help him during the 2004 elections.  Partisan advantage over the interest of the American people – your modern Republican Party!</p>

                                <p>Angry Bear (the site owner, not the site) has arranged for Bob Hormats to visit the website.  He&#8217;ll post something and stick around to answe questions that appear in the comment section on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Bob is author of <strong>The Price of Liberty: Paying for America&#8217;s Wars</strong>. Other information <a href="http://authorviews.com/authors/hormats/oped.htm">about Hormats</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bob Hormats, an investment banker, is Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs (International) and an expert in trade and finance. He&#8217;s no slouch at politics and national security matters, either. Bob has served under four U.S. Presidents, including work as a Senior Staff member on the National Security Council Staff for Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and General Brent Scowcroft.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the circumstances, I think its safe for me to cut and paste a large exerpt from that link:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, President Bush and the Democratic Congress had a showdown over Iraq war funding. Unfortunately, it was the wrong one.</p>
<p>Lost amid the week&#8217;s political struggles was this blunt reality: America&#8217;s political leaders have been reluctant to confront the public with the need to make financial sacrifices to pay for the conflict and for the ongoing struggle against al-Qaeda. And that could spell disaster later on.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t always this way. After Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt minced no words with the American people. &#8220;War costs money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means taxes and bonds and bonds and taxes. It means cutting luxuries and other non-essentials.&#8221; If only today&#8217;s leaders would say something similar.</p>
<p>Instead, Bush and Congress have played down the expense of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather than forthrightly asking the public to shoulder new post-9/11 burdens, the administration has skirted the normal budget process, relying on supplemental appropriations. Not only were no additional taxes imposed to cover extra security costs, but the country was treated to an additional tax cut in 2003.</p>
<p>The Iraq war&#8217;s supporters may have initially figured that the conflict would be short and cheap, making paying for it relatively painless. Later, they may have calculated that relying on emergency funding would make it easier to sustain the public&#8217;s support &#8212; an approach that assumes that most Americans are afraid of wartime economic sacrifice.</p>
<p>In fact, leveling with the American people early on would have been far wiser, especially as war costs have skyrocketed. (According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government has allocated about $503 billion for Iraq, Afghanistan and counterterrorism since September 2001.) After 9/11, many Americans would have supported cuts in nonessential domestic programs to make room for additional spending on homeland security or the battle against terrorism. And large numbers of taxpayers probably would have been willing to check off a box on their 2003 tax returns to pay a few extra dollars to ensure proper body armor and well-protected vehicles for our troops in Iraq, high-quality health care for returning veterans and financial support for families back home.</p>
<p>Earlier presidents directly and candidly asked the public to support extraordinary amounts of war funding. That generally meant new taxes, war-bond drives and cuts in spending on civilian programs. But such honesty did more than mobilize money; it also mobilized the home front and made it feel engaged in the cause.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, for instance, Abraham Lincoln urged &#8220;every person of small means&#8221; to buy war bonds to tie large numbers of citizens to the Union Army&#8217;s cause. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson told Congress that Americans &#8220;know that the war must be paid for and that it is they who must pay for it.&#8221; Wilson&#8217;s Treasury secretary, William G. McAdoo, said: &#8220;A man who could not serve in the trenches of France might nonetheless serve in the financial trenches at home.&#8221; He insisted that &#8220;any great war must necessarily be a popular movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably too late to use earlier leaders&#8217; wisdom to salvage support for the unpopular Iraq war. But these history lessons could still help buttress support for the broader conflict in which the country is now engaged, a global fight against radical Islamic terrorism that will need serious, sustained funding.</p>
<p>For years, Osama bin Laden has been blunt about his plans to kill large numbers of Americans and severely damage the U.S. economy; surely our leaders should be drawing up far-sighted plans to pay for a resolute effort to thwart him and his ilk. The nation must face up to the long-term costs of preventing catastrophic terrorist attacks and responding decisively should they occur. But our leaders haven&#8217;t fully spelled out these costs to the public, let alone discussed the need to change spending and tax priorities to meet them. What&#8217;s more, the absence of another domestic attack &#8212; so far &#8212; is lulling many Americans into questioning the need for substantial homeland-security spending, particularly as the graying baby-boom generation confronts us with dramatically higher Social Security and Medicare payments.</p>
<p>We are living in a post-9/11 world with a pre-9/11 fiscal policy. Without a national dialogue on how to pay our future security bill, we have no plan to replace the hardware used up or destroyed in Iraq, finance the next generation of sophisticated weaponry, care for our wounded veterans, equip our firefighters and police to respond to terrorist attacks, or strengthen our ailing intelligence system. Nor have we seen a plan to maintain the sound underlying fiscal conditions essential to our economic and military strength. Instead, we&#8217;re staring at the virtual certainty of skyrocketing deficits in the next decade &#8212; largely because of growing entitlements.</p>
<p>Entitlement programs have dramatically changed the budget landscape. Today, national security spending accounts for less than 5 percent of the nation&#8217;s gross domestic product &#8212; compared with nearly 40 percent during World War II, 15 percent during the Korean War and 10 percent during the Vietnam War. That makes it sound like it should be easy to win the needed defense funding. It won&#8217;t be. The enormous sums committed to mandatory federal programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid dwarf all other aspects of the budget. Left unchecked for a decade or two, they will consume a larger share of the nation&#8217;s GDP than all our federal programs today combined. Coupled with increasing interest payments on the government&#8217;s rising debt, they will either force up taxes or produce dangerous deficits. Unless we get entitlement costs under control, Social Security will inevitably square off against national security.</p>
<p>Since 9/11, we have also tolerated a series of budget deficits that make us financially vulnerable. In 2001, a flush budget surplus gave the United States the resources to recover and retaliate after al-Qaeda&#8217;s attacks. But now we face a deficit and the prospect of very large ones late in the next decade. Moreover, in 2001, the nation was only half as dependent on foreign money as it is today &#8212; and the more the budget deficit rises, the deeper in hock we find ourselves to countries that may not wish us well. A new act of catastrophic terrorism would weaken the economy, thereby sharply cutting federal tax revenues and increasing the deficit. The high costs of recovery (imagine what it would cost to clean up miles of Manhattan or Washington after a radioactive &#8220;dirty bomb&#8221; attack) and retaliation would further expand the deficit. That, in turn, would make many foreign investors nervous, which could cause them to sharply reduce investment in the United States &#8212; sending the dollar into a nosedive and interest rates through the roof.</p>
<p>Bipartisan efforts could still avert such calamities. The president and Congress must set clear priorities for defense spending, start serious reforms to make entitlement programs sustainable, and begin funding the war through the usual budget process rather than through supplementals and other gimmickry.</p>
<p>As in earlier wars, Americans deserve credible estimates of the costs of protecting the nation &#8212; a burden they&#8217;re likely to tolerate if they&#8217;re given the unvarnished facts. More than 200 years ago, Alexander Hamilton squarely confronted his fellow citizens with the need to pay off the enormous debt the country had incurred during the revolution. Doing so, he wrote, was &#8220;the price of liberty.&#8221; We still need to pay for our freedom today, and all Americans need to share in the cost.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Sens. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., have abandoned the troops with their opposition to a recently passed Iraq War funding bill, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told ABC News Radio in an exclusive interview Friday. Obama and Clinton have &#8220;moved from being not just anti-war, but to being anti-troops,&#8221; Giuliani said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – Rudy is a twit.  Steve writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama joined 12 other Democratic senators in opposing Bush&#8217;s war-funding package, Republican presidential candidates pounced. If Dem presidential hopefuls are willing to reject funding for the troops in a time of war, we now have proof, the GOP concluded, that they must hate the men and women in uniform … Got it. But I have a quick follow up question: If opposing money for the troops in a time of war is necessarily anti-military and un-American, why did Bush reject war funding less than a month ago? If supporting the military means supporting funding measures, didn&#8217;t the president deny those in uniform the resources they need? Or is it more likely that rejecting funding for the troops in a time of war is perfectly acceptable to Republicans, just so long as they think there&#8217;s a good reason to do so?</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds about right but there’s a problem.  It seems <a href="http://www.blogowogo.com/blog_article.php?aid=769194&#038;t=">three</a> of those Nay votes come from Republicans:</p>
<blockquote><p>NAYs &#8211; 14<br />Boxer (D-CA)<br />Burr (R-NC)<br />Clinton (D-NY)<br />Coburn (R-OK)<br />Dodd (D-CT)<br />Enzi (R-WY)<br />Feingold (D-WI)<br />Kennedy (D-MA)<br />Kerry (D-MA)<br />Leahy (D-VT)<br />Obama (D-IL)<br />Sanders (I-VT)<br />Whitehouse (D-RI)<br />Wyden (D-OR)</p>
<p>Not Voting &#8211; 6<br />Brownback (R-KS)<br />Coleman (R-MN)<br />Hatch (R-UT)<br />Johnson (D-SD)<br />Schumer (D-NY)<br />Thomas (R-WY)</p></blockquote>
<p>And 4 of the 6 not voting were also Republicans!  So Brownback, Coleman, Hatch, and Thomas couldn’t take the time to vote for this bill – while Burr, Coburn, and Enzi voted against it.  So by Rudy’s logic, they are against our troops.  I hate to say this about a former mayor of New York City – but the man is an idiot.</p>
