                                <p>Now <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/04/national/main2762113.shtml">this</a> is fascinating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Rifle Association is urging the Bush administration to withdraw its support of a bill that would prohibit suspected terrorists from buying firearms. </p>
<p>Backed by the Justice Department, the measure would give the attorney general the discretion to block gun sales, licenses or permits to terror suspects. </p>
<p>In a letter this week to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, NRA executive director Chris Cox said the bill, offered last week by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., &#8220;would allow arbitrary denial of Second Amendment rights based on mere &#8216;suspicions&#8217; of a terrorist threat.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The NRA is right that with this administration, who the heck knows who ends up on a terrorist watch list. There are a lot of people who apparently aren&#8217;t allowed on planes these days. But the idea of folks that are suspected of terrorist ties buy a gun seems crazy. Perhaps its time the administration narrowed down its suspect list a wee bit.</p>
<p>I note also&#8230; a few other items in the Bill of Rights have already gone by the wayside for those for whom there are &#8220;mere &#8216;suspicions'&#8221;.</p>

                                <p>With free trade, there are always winners and losers. Until about twenty years ago, that wasn’t a big deal here in the US… the losers were generally foreigners. It’s a big deal now because Americans are losing their jobs, or seeing their standards of living fall. What’s changed? (1) The US adopted new technologies/tools/methods far enough in advance of other countries, but these things diffuse much more quickly today. (2) Many jobs were protected from foreign competition. The number of jobs that could be exported were much smaller.</p>
<p>The US has collectively shot itself in the foot when it comes to education. The quality of US education relative to that of other countries seems to have been slowly deteriorating. US graduate schools still seem to be considered the best, but its certainly not true of undergraduate or high school. I remember in grad school… I don’t know precisely what percentage of students that started the program didn’t get complete their Ph.D., but I would estimate it at 50%. Whatever that fraction was, it was much worse for Americans. Why? Because we simply were not as prepared. Period. I remember in week one seeing things for the first time that my Mexican roommate (also in the program) had taken an entire year’s worth of coursework in. It happened repeatedly, on a number of topics. And not just with my Mexican roommate. My Danish, German, Swiss, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Peruvian, Argentine, Brazilian, Chilean, Uruguayan, etc., classmates, all seemed to be a heck of a lot better prepared than I was, and I was one of the few Americans that survived the program. And by the way, in most cases, we’re talking folks who graduated from public schools abroad, so it sure as heck isn’t a function of public versus private education.</p>
<p>In terms of education, we’re collectively shooting ourselves in the foot more and more. Math now is something to be feared. That might not have been a problem in times past, but these days so much data is available on the internet that someone who is afraid to look at data is simply going to be at a disadvantage. And why/how can anyone think there’s a difference between creativity and science and/or math? It doesn’t mean we all have to be mathematicians, but it helps to be literate. And WTF is creationism? (And this is not a knock on religion. There are plenty of religious people out there that nevertheless don’t have much of a problem with science.) I realize that GW thinks we should “teach the controversy” but what exactly is the controversy? </p>
<p>I’ve noted elsewhere – I’m conceptually in favor of free trade. I’m against it if its just being used as a way to facilitate the imposition of externalities onto third parties. For example, if a company is moving to Mexico simply to take advantage of laxer pollution enforcement, I’m against it.</p>
<p>What about the losers in free trade? As noted earlier, people in the US tended to be the winners in free trade for many decades. Hence, the fact that compensation for those who lost out were minimal (unemployment compensation, welfare, etc.) was not a big problem. Now, it is becoming a problem. Maybe its time to revisit the compensation issue. </p>
<p>Why are some of the fastest growing countries (China, Vietnam) run by Communist parties?</p>
<p>Healthcare costs are clearly contributing to the lack of US competitiveness. Something I&#8217;ve mentioned on another post&#8230; I noticed, in graduate school, when the wives of my male Latin American classmates got pregnant, they usually went back to their home country to have the child. (I don&#8217;t remember any female foreign students getting pregnant, nor the wives of non-Latin Americans getting pregnant. But among Latin American students, there was a population explosion during the five years I was there.) Now, these were people that had insurance both at home and abroad. And in every single case, they went back to Mexico or Peru or Argentina to have the kid. It told me something about the much vaunted US healthcare system.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I remember watching “Free to Choose.” Its been half my lifetime ago, so my memory is dim, but as I recall, Milton Friedman noted that there was no reason to be concerned over a trade deficit – in fact, it was a good thing. After all, the Japanese sent us boomboxes and watches and cars, and we sent them little green pieces of paper. Clearly, the Japanese were the ones getting the raw end of the stick. Frankly, if my memory is correct, I think Uncle Milt was a bit blasé about the obligation those green pieces of paper represented, but that’s a topic for another day. I would note… the loss in value of the dollar means we’re getting a lot fewer things from them foreigner people than we used to. And it doesn’t seem to have helped US competitiveness. What happens if them foreigner people realize that there is no particular reason to think of the dollar as being specialer (to use a term that no doubt GW will think up some day) than some other currency? Its happened before… at one time, the pound sterling was the most specialer currency out there. As the English economy became less specialer, their currency followed suit.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s an easy solution out there to the plight of the average American. When I was growing up, it was illegal to import electronic equipment into most South American countries. If they caught you at it, you paid a 200% tariff, even for things like calculators. The goal was to foster the domestic industry, especially the computer industry. The end result was that South Americans were stuck with lousier, more expensive computers than were available in the US. Eventually, it was so damaging to other industries that needed computers that the policy was scrapped.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>CBS Evening News covered <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/020307dntexlotto.43c38852.html">this story</a>, which was reported on February 2, 2007 (yes Groundhog Day) by Emily Ranshaw of the Dallas Morning News:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle raised doubts Friday about Gov. Rick Perry&#8217;s proposal to privatize the Texas lottery, saying the state shouldn&#8217;t sell off assets to meet basic budget needs. Mr. Perry declined to comment on the idea, but he told the Austin American-Statesman this week that he would ask the Legislature to sell the lottery to private parties to raise money for health care and research efforts. He is expected to unveil this plan during Tuesday&#8217;s State of the State address to lawmakers. But some lawmakers on committees that oversee lottery issues said that they think the plan is bad policy and that the state should simply raise the revenue if it needs to fund more health programs. Others said they wouldn&#8217;t comment until they had heard the full proposal. Selling core state assets, particularly income-producing assets like the lottery, is a very short-term solution to a long-term problem,&#8221; said Sen. John Carona, R-Dallas, who serves on the Senate&#8217;s State Affairs Committee. Proposals to privatize the state lottery aren&#8217;t unique to Texas. Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Washington, D.C., have all considered turning over their lotteries to private companies under long-term leases that would include lump-sum payments to the state and, in some cases, annual royalties. So far, none of the 42 states that operate lotteries has approved such a sale. Privatization is attractive because the large upfront payments could be used to dig states out of financial crises, or to fund health or education programs. Illinois, for example, hopes to get up to $10 billion upfront to lease the state lottery system. And it&#8217;s a reasonable option for those who don&#8217;t think the state ought to be in the business of running a gambling operation. In general, day-to-day lottery operations are already farmed out to private companies. But it&#8217;s also hotly contested. Texas&#8217; history of privatizing services is spotty at best – a point highlighted by problems thousands of poor families have had renewing their children&#8217;s health coverage using privately run call centers. Opponents of privatization say taking the government out of the picture could lead to corruption or fraud. And while the lump-sum payment is a draw, some privatization opponents say that eventually, more revenue will be going to a private company and less to the state. &#8220;What it&#8217;s doing is handing out crown monopolies to favored individuals, and probably not doing it in a way that is economically justified nor fair to the Texas citizenry,&#8221; said Earl Grinols, a Baylor University economist. The Texas lottery contributed $1 billion to the state&#8217;s revenue last year. And while it&#8217;s gone through some trying times, Rep. Ismael &#8220;Kino&#8221; Flores said that today, it&#8217;s &#8220;one of the best-run lotteries around.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms.Ranshaw did a nice job starting with the complaint put forth by Senator Carona and Baylor economist Earl Grinols.  CBS News also noted that this lottery contributed around $1 billion in revenues and claimed that the Governor is only asking for $14 billion for this asset.  </p>
<p>Even if one is bothered by the government running a gambling operation, one would think the state could get a better price.  Let’s illustrate by assuming a 4.91% long-term nominal interest rate and a 2.6% expected inflation rate (consistent with the long-term real rate of 2.25% as reported <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update">here</a>).  If real revenues stay the same (nominal revenues rise by 2.6% per year), the present value of 75-years worth of revenues is over $35 billion.  If some private investors purchased these cash flows for only $14 billion, the expected return to this investment would be 9.2%.  A sweet deal if one can convince one’s political friends to give it to you.</p>

                                <p>National security spending …“Elevates inefficiency to a national purpose”  Seymour Melman</p>
<p>Divorced one like Bush sent the link: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1157&#038;Itemid=77">http://www.cepr.net/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1157&#038;Itemid=77</a></p>
<p>“For the report, <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1155&#038;Itemid=8The%20Economic%20Impact%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War%20and%20Higher%20Military%20Spending">The Economic Impact of the Iraq War and Higher Military Spending</a>, by economist Dean Baker, Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) commissioned Global Insight to run a simulation with its macroeconomic model.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The model runs show for a 1% of GDP increase in military spending, similar to what has been since 11 Sep 2001:&#8221;</p>
<p>“After 10 years of higher defense spending, there would be 464,000 fewer jobs than in the baseline scenario with lower defense spending.”</p>
<p>“After 5 years, annual car and truck sales are projected to go down by 192,200 in the high military spending scenario. After 10 years, the drop is projected to be 323,300 and after 20 years annual sales are projected to be down 731,400.”</p>
<p>“Construction and manufacturing are the sectors that are projected to experience the largest shares of the job loss.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It is often believed that wars and military spending increases are good for the economy,&#8221; said Baker. &#8220;In fact, most economic models show that military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment, and ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is in line with a paper by Thomas E. Woods at; <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/woods2.pdf">http://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/woods2.pdf</a>  “Neglected Costs of the Warfare State” </p>
<p>The paper quotes Seymour Melman (1917-2004) and the idea that when resources are devoted to military spending they are taken from other urgent needs.  Melman of Columbia University extended the work of Frederic Bastiat, (1801 to 1850) who stated similar findings to Baker’s.<br />“the costs not only of modern American wars but also of the defense establishment itself.</p>
<p>“Industrial productivity,” he [Melman] wrote, “the foundation of every nation’s economic growth, is eroded by the relentlessly predatory effects of the military economy…. Traditional economic competence of every sort is being eroded by the state capitalist directorate that elevates inefficiency into a national purpose, that disables the market system, that destroys the value of the currency, and that diminishes the decision power of all institutions……..”</p>
<p>Here is why I write about waste in national security projects.</p>

Chris Wallace is not a journalist but rather a liar.  Even the folks over at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTQ2OTZkYjBjN2E0YmM4NmYyZGQxMjczNzM2NTY3MTI=">The Corner</a> has being more honest about this latest Al Qaeda rant. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=3143623">ABC</a> provides a more complete discussion of what Zawahiri really said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a new video posted today on the Internet, al Qaeda&#8217;s number two man, Ayman al Zawahiri, mocks the bill passed by Congress setting a timetable for the pullout of U.S. troops in Iraq. &#8220;This bill will deprive us of the opportunity to destroy the American forces which we have caught in a historic trap,&#8221; Zawahiri says in answer to a question posed to him an interviewer. Continuing in the same tone, Zawahiri says, &#8220;We ask Allah that they only get out of it after losing 200,000 to 300,000 killed, in order that we give the spillers of blood in Washington and Europe an unforgettable lesson.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The 3/19/2003 decision by George W. Bush to invade Iraq did put us in an “historic trap”.  Zawahiri wants us to stay in the trap – and apparently Chris Wallace wants the same thing.  So why is President Bush so incredibly stupid that he continues to play into Al Qaeda’s hands?</p>

<blockquote><p>The detailed mental health survey of troops in Iraq released by the Pentagon on Friday highlights a growing worry for the United States as it struggles to bring order to Baghdad: the high level of combat stress suffered during lengthy and repeated tours. </p>
<p>The fourth in a continuing series, the report suggested that extended tours and multiple deployments, among other policy decisions, could escalate anger and increase the likelihood that soldiers or marines lash out at civilians, or defy military ethics.</p>
<p>That is no small concern since the United States’ counterinsurgency doctrine emphasizes the importance of winning the trust and support of the local population. </p>
<p>The report was provided in November to Gen. George W. Casey Jr., then the senior American commander in Iraq. </p>
<p>Pentagon officials have not explained why the public release of the report was delayed, a move that kept the data out of the public debate as the Bush administration developed its plan to build up troops in Iraq and extend combat tours. Rear Adm. Richard R. Jeffries, a medical officer, told reporters on Friday that the timing was decided by civilian Pentagon officials.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Friday, when the report was released, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/battlefield-ethics-mental-health.html">I noted</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;By Monday, this report will never have happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, I was wrong. If they had wanted to do anything about it, they would have done something (other than delay its release) in the preceding four months. And they certainly wouldn&#8217;t have extended tours of duty even more. I apologize to our readers, and note that the sentence above should be replaced with:</p>
<p>&#8220;By four months ago, this report will never have happened.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>According to a Newsweek poll, GW&#8217;s approval rating is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18491981/site/newsweek/">28%</a>. 28% was as low as it ever got for Jimmy Carter. According to the poll, 62% of Americans also feel that GW&#8217;s recent actions in Iraq demonstrate he&#8217;s stubborn and won&#8217;t admit mistakes.</p>
<p>Now a question&#8230; if Jimmy Carter was currently President, with an increasing debt, an underperforming economy, most Americans dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, and some severe problems in Iraq and Afghanistan&#8230; I suspect most of us would be saying: &#8220;He can&#8217;t even do a good job in this country. The Constitution says we&#8217;re stuck with him for another year and a half. But is it moral to stay in Iraq and inflict his incompetence on the Iraqis as well for that remaining period?&#8221; </p>
<p>And not a soul would call that Carter Derangement Syndrome.</p>
<p>Why is it Bush Derangement Syndrome to argue that GW be given no more (and no less) benefit of the doubt than Jimmy Carter? I see a Bush Derangement Syndrome &#8211; its among those who think that despite all evidence, this administration can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t make things worse. We&#8217;re stuck with him and that fate. Do we have the right to pin the Iraqis to that fate too?</p>

<blockquote><p>Gruma, the world&#8217;s largest tortilla company, unveiled plans Friday to build a major factory in Panorama City, part of a growing influx of Mexican spending in the U.S. In an announcement timed with a visit here by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Gruma said it would spend $51.5 million to build the tortilla and chip plant, which is expected to employ about 350 workers and open in 2008. The factory, which would operate under the Mission Foods brand, would be about the same size as the firm&#8217;s facility in Rancho Cucamonga, billed as the world&#8217;s largest tortilla factory, with the capacity to crank out more than 300 million pounds of tortillas and chips a year. The proposed tortilla behemoth is the latest example of U.S. investment by Mexican businesses searching for new customers and faster growth. In the process they have defied predictions that pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement would send all jobs and investment south.</p></blockquote>
<p>Checking with <a href="http://www.bea.gov/international">this source</a>, we see that U.S. direct investment in Mexico rose from $10.3 billion in 1990 to $71.4 billion in 2005.  It does appear that under NAFTA, a lot of investment went south.  As far as investment coming north, Mexican direct investment in the U.S. was less than $1 billion in 1990 and was less than $9 billion as of 2005.  Nonetheless, I’m happy that Gruma plans to build a tortilla in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>You find Gruma’s Annual Report for 2005 <a href="http://ww.gruma.com/vIng/Relacion/relacion_annual.asp?anio=2005&#038;idEmpresa=1&#038;OpMenu=3">here</a>.  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gmk">Yahoo</a> also provides select information including the fact that in 2005, Gruma sold almost $2.5 billion in tortillas and related products.  Gruma is even opening a tortilla factory in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve become very much part of Los Angeles as I find there isn’t much better than fresh tortillas – especially on Cinco de Mayo!</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/04/AR2007050402359.html?hpid=topnews?hpid=topnews">Atrios</a>, a story in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/04/AR2007050402359.html?hpid=topnews?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD &#8212; Iraq is hemorrhaging doctors as violence racks the nation. To stem the flow, the Iraqi government has recently taken a cue from Saddam Hussein: Medical schools are once again forbidden to issue diplomas and transcripts to new graduates.</p>
<p>Hussein built a fine medical system in part by withholding doctors&#8217; passports and diplomas. Although physicians can work in Iraq with a letter from a medical school verifying their graduation, they say they need certificates and transcripts to work abroad.</p>
<p>It is a common refrain among war-weary Iraqis that things were better before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Electricity in Baghdad was more reliable; sectarian hostility was rare; Iraq was safe &#8212; except for the many victims of Hussein&#8217;s tyranny. But rarely has the government embraced a policy that so harshly evokes the era of dictatorship. To some students and doctors, the diploma decision, like Iraq&#8217;s crumbling medical system, provides clear proof of the government&#8217;s helplessness and the nation&#8217;s decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They have no right to impose such a restriction,&#8221; Jassem said. &#8220;If the government cannot provide security for the doctors, then why should it stand in their way to leave?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Khatib said the Health Ministry had come up with the proposal, noting that the agency that runs the nation&#8217;s hospitals would be its principal beneficiary. Health Ministry spokesman Qasim Yahya denied the assertion.</p>
<p>Not that his ministry is complaining. &#8220;We welcome the decision, even though we know this is against the basic rights of individuals,&#8221; Yahya said. &#8220;But it is in the interest of the Iraqi people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>The Iraqi Medical Association, with which all physicians must register to practice, estimates that at least one-third of the country&#8217;s 40,000 or so doctors have fled to Jordan, Syria and other countries. Waleed Khalid, the association&#8217;s vice president, said the organization issues 30 to 50 &#8220;certificates of good standing&#8221; to Iraqi physicians every day &#8212; forms that any doctor must have to work abroad, he said.</p>
<p>Medical schools have also suffered. At Baghdad University&#8217;s Kindi Teaching Hospital &#8212; where 90 percent of surgeries are trauma cases, mostly involving bomb and shooting victims &#8212; half the teaching positions are vacant, said Hameed Hussein al-Araji, head of the surgery department. General surgery instructors must fill in for specialists, such as the cardiothoracic surgery professor who was assassinated last year, he said.</p>
<p>Only about 25 percent of students are able to attend classes daily, Araji said. The rest, kept away by explosions and gunfire and roadblocks, use lecture notes to study at home and show up only for exams.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Fadhil, who has dreamed of being a doctor since she was a child, said she feels sorry that Iraq is losing its physicians. Then again, she said, fear of leaving her house kept her away from classes for all but 10 days of the first three months of this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>One senior medical school official in Baghdad has no sympathy with such arguments. In an interview in his central Baghdad office, he railed against what he views as &#8220;exploitation&#8221; by graduates, accusing them of stealing away with a &#8220;national treasure&#8221; &#8212; a free medical education. The students have a duty to stay, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put it right: What was happening in Saddam&#8217;s time was better than what is happening now,&#8221; said the official, who said he did not want his name published out of fear for his life. &#8220;There was order. There was discipline. This we are losing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the medical association says it will dispute the diploma decision, doctors and students said they plan no public protest, fearing it could get them killed.</p>
<p>Besides, some said, Iraq&#8217;s disorder could yield benefits &#8212; corruption is rampant, so rules can be broken. Fadhil said there were rumors on campus that graduates could get their degrees from the Ministry of Higher Education by paying a bribe of about $5,700. Araji, the surgery professor, said he has heard it costs a mere $200.</p></blockquote>
