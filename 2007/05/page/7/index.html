                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Which must be why the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWJjODhlYTQ5MWYyZmQ1ZjQ5M2NhODEwZWM1ZTJmNjA=">National Review</a> published his idiocy with this subtitle:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats are poised to reverse over a decade of Republican tax relief</p></blockquote>
<p>McConnell is complaining that the Democratic led Congress might follow in the footsteps of President Clinton and the 1993 tax bill:</p>
<blockquote><p>Until Thursday, the largest tax increase had been in 1993. That’s when Bill Clinton proposed a monstrous budget that even he would later admit had contained too many tax hikes.</p></blockquote>
<p>McConnell is basically saying that raising tax rates might cost a party some votes.  What he fails to address in this NRO oped is the simple proposition “to spend is to tax”, which is often attributed to Milton Friedman.  President Clinton inherited a large deficit, which means that current taxes are not covering spending with the deficit being essentially deferred taxation.  Federal spending as a share of GDP actually fell during Clinton’s Administration.  Since then, Federal spending has increased which means the sum of current taxes and deferred taxes has risen under President George W. Bush.  Notice in his criticism of the current Congress, he does not identify a single place where Congress is proposing a massive increase in Federal spending.  Rather he writes this tired old spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Democrats sounded a thrifty tune in the run-up to the November elections. They know about the tax-and-spend stereotype, so many insisted things would be different this time around. But budget season is always the most telling time of year on Capitol Hill. And as Democrats on Thursday advanced the largest tax hike in history, the story they’re telling is this: The party of tax and spend is back, with a vengeance.</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be compared to the spend and borrow party represented by Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Mitch McConnell.</p>

                                <p>Updated below.</p>
<p>Cactus&#8217; post got me thinking. And, holding true to my thought that we have changed our focus I decided to take a longer view.<br />First is at chart by year from 1929 to 2006 of the savings % of disposable income.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3i_poP6_I/AAAAAAAAACs/--HCvlrCB_o/s1600-h/Personal+Savings+as+%25+of+Disposable+Income.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3i_poP6_I/AAAAAAAAACs/--HCvlrCB_o/s320/Personal+Savings+as+%25+of+Disposable+Income.JPG" border="0"></a><br />Notice the WWII years? This is the same time income from entrepreneurship was peaking. But, we don&#8217;t see the same relationship during the 90&#8217;s.
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3i3JoP6-I/AAAAAAAAACk/UMAOwMYlj4w/s1600-h/Income+from+Entrepreneurship.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3i3JoP6-I/AAAAAAAAACk/UMAOwMYlj4w/s320/Income+from+Entrepreneurship.JPG" border="0"></a>Income from interest looks similar too. As I noted in a prior post, the interest income curve followed the Fed Rate curve. The interest income peak coincides with the percentage peak of savings in the first chart. The savings % of disposable income peaks in 1982 at 11.2 and the income from interest peaks in 1981 for all 3 groups. (Note the scale range is different so that the peak for interest looks greater.)
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3iuJoP69I/AAAAAAAAACc/CLwBXvcHOq8/s1600-h/Income+from+Interest.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/Rk3iuJoP69I/AAAAAAAAACc/CLwBXvcHOq8/s320/Income+from+Interest.JPG" border="0"></a><br />What is most interesting, is that share of income from wages is peaking just after this for the top 5%. The 95 to 99 group at 76.4 in 1983, the to 1% at 66.1 in 1984 and the top 0.1% at 53.9 in 1984. Only the top 0.1% see an greater peak after this and it&#8217;s in 2000 at 58.2 % of their income from wages.<br />Income from rents and dividends decline from the mid to late 20&#8217;s until rent income starts to rise in 88/89 and dividends income changes direction in 2000.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would say that savings is a function of income from wages (updated) and interest rates. There could be a factor related to people investing in entrepreneurship, but it is a special circumstance. That the trend for savings is down after the Reagan revolution continues to suggest to me that we have changed our thinking about how to make money.</div>
<div>As to Cactus&#8217;s concern about increased savings in a down turn, I looked a the individual quarters of each recession (years prior to 1947). Overall, savings goes down during the recession. When it goes up, it is an oddity. They are 1969, 1980 and 1990. The 1969 is truly odd in that the rise is a change of 1.5 where as the other two are only 0.5. And they we have 2001 with it&#8217;s one quarter that has a freakish increase followed by a death dive.</div>

<div>Update:<br />Cactus mentions GW&#8217;s worst years. It is interesting when we look at interest, rent, dividends and entrepreneurship.<br />For the 90 to 95 group we see their income coming from dividends (1.5 rise to 1.9) and rent (.03 rise to 1.2). Are we seeing the effects of investing in 401K&#8217;s and real estate? Interest goes down from 2.1 to 1.8% of total income.<br />The 95 to 99 group is the same. Dividend rise from 3.2 to 4.7 and rent from 1.8 to 2.2 with interest income declining from 3.9 to a low of 2.9.<br />Even the top 1% is similar.  Dividend income rises from 4.2 to 6.6.  Rent rises from 2.5 to 2.7 and interest declines from 5.1 to 4.8.<br />Income from interest is at it&#8217;s lowest in 2004 for all 3 groups.</p>
<p>But, when we look at the top 0.1% we see the greatest rises here. Dividends goes from 5.2 to 10. Rents don&#8217;t rise as great as the lower 2 groups going from 2.9 to 3.1. However, interest income does the opposite of what we saw, it rises from 6.7 to 7.1. The other groups fell.</p>
<p> The key to the puzzle I believe is in the income from entrepreneurship and the amount of income in the top 1%. For the lowest 2 groups income from entrepreneurship rises. 5.0 to 7.4 in the 90 to 95 group, 18.9 to 21.5 in the 95 to 99 group. The top 1% has a healthy change from 26.5 to 29.1, but the top 0.1% only rises form 31.3 to 35.1.  As a % change this is the smallest. </p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The income in 2005 for the top 1% was approximately 2.5 trillion dollars. In 2005 the top 1% has about 22% of the income, the top 0.1% has 11%. We are talking a lot of money in the top 0.1%. I think it is enough to influence savings when you consider that the 0.1% group is earning a rising percentage of income from saving type investments than from income generating investments. They are the only group with an increase in income from interest. The rest of the people, mainly the 90 to 99% group are putting their money into things that make income. That is business,  income generating real estate and stocks . </div>
<div>Thus, what we are seeing is a trend that as income goes up (with the majority from wages for all) people put their money in to savings vehicles of less risk. The 0.1% crowd is packing it away in interest bearing stuff. Those at the lower end will try to increase their income via income generators; entrepreneurship and rents. Being that equity does not count as savings, such only shows up in rents. Entrepreneurship would not show up in the savings rate either. It appears we have a transition from trying to increase income via work through entrepreneurship and real estate to more passive income of dividends to just plain playing it safe with interest when you have income that puts you in the stratospheres (about $5.5 million per year) as oppose to the $96K entry fee to the top 10%.</p>

<blockquote><p>May 21, 2007 issue &#8211; Last week house speaker Nancy Pelosi and congress-man Charles Rangel showed genuine leadership by making a deal with the Bush administration to ease the passage of new trade pacts. But they did so from within a party that is going seriously awry on this issue. Too many Democrats, including most of their presidential candidates, simply wish the subject would go away.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Globalization and technological change produce real anxieties for many people in the developed world. But the basic facts are incontestable: over the past 20 years, as these forces have accelerated, the United States has benefited enormously. Its companies have dominated the new global economic order; its consumers have reaped the lion&#8217;s share of the resulting price reductions.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>In this context it is almost bizarre to listen to the fears of so many Democrats (and increasingly some Republicans). The Central American Free Trade Agreement, which has almost no effect on the $13 trillion American economy but is a huge benefit to the countries in the region, passed the Senate with little Democratic support. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was in Asia last month, I was told by several officials that they found themselves in an uncomfortable position. They liked what they heard from Democrats on America&#8217;s role in the world, but they were terrified by what they heard about trade. One of them, who declined to give his name for fear of giving offense, said, &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s an easy call for us. We don&#8217;t like the Republicans on foreign policy. We think they&#8217;ve been stupid and unilateral. But they are staunchly progressive on free trade and that&#8217;s the most important issue for us by far.&#8221; Democrats cannot plausibly hope to lead the world by abdicating America&#8217;s historic role as the leader of an open global economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>What America needs is a new way to tackle trade. It is a C-and-T agenda: cushion and train. The government should help people to weather the shocks of this roller-coaster ride, and it should help train them to be better equipped for the next round of global competition. We do very little of this today. When someone loses his job in America, he loses his health care and pension. Imagine if that didn&#8217;t happen—and it doesn&#8217;t in other rich countries—would that worker be as terrified of change? And then imagine if he took a series of retraining and education courses to prepare him for a new job or career.</p>
<p>These two shock absorbers would better equip the average American to face a world of global competition. It would ease the genuine anxieties that people have about trade and build durable political support for expanding the world economy rather than walling us in. It&#8217;s a more sensible solution than China bashing, bogus labor standards and protectionist subsidies. It&#8217;s a New Deal for trade. Now is any Democrat willing to say that?</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to head out now, so I don&#8217;t have time to comment.  Have at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>MUSCATATUCK, Indiana (Reuters) &#8211; The National Guard is likely to see an unprecedented level of new funds to fix or replace equipment worn out in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that&#8217;s still not enough to make the force ready for homeland missions, its chief said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president&#8217;s budget is unprecedented in the history of the Guard in providing money to the Army National Guard to reequip,&#8221; said Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau.</p>
<p>But still, it leaves equipment gaps, especially in the area of Humvees, trucks and other transport gear, that do not match the level of risk Blum said he sees.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a serious commitment to do this, but that still only takes us to a level I&#8217;d rather not talk about.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>According to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, state governors have on average about 56 percent of their Guard equipment available. If Congress approved funding the Bush administration requested for the next five years, equipment levels would be up to 76 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Historically, states have had about 70 percent of their authorized equipment, Gates told Congress last week.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan also sends along some questions&#8230;</p>
<p>Is there enough equipment at what level of replacement?  And is it the right kind for disaster relief?  Is 70% good enough for equipment?  Is 56 percent enough?  Is either too much?  How do we know?</p>

                                <p>A huge part of the DoD budget has nothing to do with the common defense.  Filled with waste.  One form is privatized bureaucrats.  Why many love long war and play on a frightened populace.</p>
<p>One reason that there are few examples of wasteful, expensive weapons being terminated like the A-12, is many acquisition programs no longer use career civil servants who are protected by Title 5 United States Code from retaliation.  Program offices are now populated with “non personal services” contractor support who if they raise an issue uncomfortable to the &#8220;agenda&#8221; are eliminated with one phone call.</p>
<p>Thus few in the government office will side with good decisions when the program manager needs to deliver a bad system, “you want it badly, you get it bad”.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I received a a request for utterly mundane information from a “dot mil” e-mail account but after the name was “.ctr”, meaning the person sending the e-mail for mundane, senseless data was a contractor, working for a company performing “non personal services”.  By the acquisition regulations and terms of the contract that person cannot deliver the service, the company he works for has to deliver it.</p>
<p>So, I received an e-mail from a company using the “dot mil” e-mail system to acquire and send them very insignificant information.  Wasting my time and several others.</p>
<p>What should I think of this?</p>
<p>Are services companies making work for other services companies?  Are they making work for the few remaining government people who have little interest in telling the folks in DC some insignificant fact about what they are doing?</p>
<p>Seems to me, with a war going on and not being able to send good personal equipment to the soldiers, the government should fire the contracted out bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I won’t even go into how one would put a price on the services provided by the company whom that e-mail originator works for.  Was the work to put together the request worthy of the labor rate billed?  Were the hours expended spent productively?  Were too many hour used to fill an otherwise empty workday?  Work year?</p>
<p>“Non personal services” are intangibles, a new code for the waste.  An expensive evolution of painting rocks only with profits not privates.</p>
<p>This is not unique to DoD.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The other day I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">changes in a number of series over various Presidential administrations</a> beginning with Ike. I looked over the list, wondering why I never looked at disposable (i.e., after tax) income and savings.</p>
<p>Then I went looking for the data and remembered. Data on disposable income and savings is available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Accounts <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S2">Table 2.1</a>.</p>
<p>And while I trust the BEA when it comes to things like GDP and other big picture series of which they are the ultimate source, I simply don&#8217;t trust their 2 series tables, the ones on personal income and outlays. </p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at annual data since Reagan took office in Table 2.1. In particular, consider lines 26 (disposable personal income) and 33 (personal saving). Since 1981, the correlation between these two series has been -0.75. In other words, a negative 75% correlation between disposable personal income and saving. The greater our collective after tax income, the less we save.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m willing to assume that Americans buy more big screen tvs than is good for our collective health (easy for me to say &#8211; I barely watch tv and thus don&#8217;t have one), but it seems unlikely that one would save more as one&#8217;s income dropped.</p>
<p>But even suspending one&#8217;s disbelief over that, there&#8217;s still another problem. Line 34 of Table 2.1 tells us the personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal<br />income. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like since 1981. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RkzM4SSzD1I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/m7EwE7i7PUo/s1600-h/personal+saving+div+disposable+income.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RkzM4SSzD1I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/m7EwE7i7PUo/s320/personal+saving+div+disposable+income.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I see on the graph&#8230; Savings as a perecentage of disposable income climbs during recessions, downturns and periods of relative weakness (1981, 1984, the GHW years, 2002). It falls when times are relatively good&#8230; the second half of Reagan&#8217;s term and most of Clinton&#8217;s term. During GW&#8217;s term, savings fell once the economy picked up a bit, and have been negative for the last two years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t believe it. I simply don&#8217;t. Unless and until someone convinces me this data makes any damn sense, I am not going to look at how disposable personal income and/or personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income changed over time.  At least not using data originating at the BEA.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Charles C. Krulak was commandant of the Marine Corps from 1995 to 1999. Joseph P. Hoar was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command from 1991 to 1994.  I have borrowed the title from their <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/16/AR2007051602395.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns">WaPo oped</a> which expresses a serious problem with something that occurred during the GOP Presidential debate in South Carolina:</p>
<blockquote><p>The American people are understandably fearful about another attack like the one we sustained on Sept. 11, 2001. But it is the duty of the commander in chief to lead the country away from the grip of fear, not into its grasp. Regrettably, at Tuesday night&#8217;s presidential debate in South Carolina, several Republican candidates revealed a stunning failure to understand this most basic obligation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could list several reasons why neither Mitt Romney nor Rudy Giuliani is fit to be the next President of our nation.  These two former generals do an admirable job of detailing one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader ilsm alerts us to <a href="http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/apr/28/few-candidates-rsums-include-military-service">this AP story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 2008 presidential campaign is long on war rhetoric and short on warriors.  Despite the high-profile roles of the battle against terrorism and conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the presidential campaign, few of the candidates can claim military experience on their resumes. Of the top tier of 2008 candidates, only Republican John McCain has been to war … Draft deferments kept Giuliani, 62, of out Vietnam while he attended law school. In 1968, as the Vietnam War was escalating, he was classified 1-A, or draft eligible. After going to work for a federal judge, he received an occupational deferment. He was classified 1-A again in 1970, but had a high lottery number. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 60, received a draft deferment while serving as a Mormon missionary in France during the war. He was eligible for the draft later, but was not selected.</p></blockquote>
<p>So our two pro-torture GOP leading candidates can be seen as chicken hawks.  Not that I would necessarily vote for him – but isn’t it high time Senator Hagel toss his hand into the ring?  I’m elated that Ron Paul has the courage of conviction to criticize the Iraq War but it’s too damn easy for Rudy Giuliani to go after Mr. Paul with that faux macho garbage that Rudy is known for – especially when the audience in South Carolina whoops it up in response.  </p>
<p>Now if Chuck Hagel were on stage criticizing this war – would the chicken hawks be so willing to go after someone who did bother to serve in the Vietnam War?  Or did I just forget about those Swift Boat liars back in 2004?  How sick has the modern Republican Party become?</p>

<blockquote><p>The chart shows the economic growth of two different sets of countries. The first set comprises nations that are both politically and economically free; the second, those that are repressed politically (have high numbers on the Freedom House scale) but are economically free. In each case, I looked at the average five-year growth rate of GDP, weighted by the size of each respective economy.  The chart tells a striking story: the countries that are economically and politically free are underper¬forming the countries that are economically but not politically free. For example, unfree China had a growth rate of 9.5 percent from 2001 to 2005. But China was not the whole story &#8211; Malaysia’s GDP grew 9.5 percent from 1991 to 1995, Singapore’s GDP grew 6.4 percent from 1996 to 2000, and Russia’s grew 6.1 percent from 2001 to 2005.  The unfree governments now understand that they have to provide a good economy to keep citizens happy, and they understand that free-market econ¬omies work best. Also, nearly all of the unfree nations are developing countries. History shows they grow faster, at least for a while, than mature nations. But being unfree may be an economic advantage. Dictatorships are not hamstrung by the preferences of voters for, say, a pervasive welfare state.</p></blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as supply-side silliness gone wild.  Beyond the cheap shot at the “welfare state” (who knew that the People’s Republic of China was not a welfare state) – Kevin offers us nothing in the way of economic policies to suggest why China is growing faster than the U.S.  And notice that he omits the growth rates of the 1990’s when discussing Russia’s economy.  Maybe it is because Russia’s GDP fell during much of the early part of that decade.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html#Econ">This source</a> describes the Russian economy thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Russia ended 2006 with its eighth straight year of growth, averaging 6.7% annually since the financial crisis of 1998. Although high oil prices and a relatively cheap ruble initially drove this growth, since 2003 consumer demand and, more recently, investment have played a significant role. Over the last five years, fixed capital investments have averaged real gains greater than 10% per year and personal incomes have achieved real gains more than 12% per year. During this time, poverty has declined steadily and the middle class has continued to expand. Russia has also improved its international financial position since the 1998 financial crisis. The federal budget has run surpluses since 2001 and ended 2006 with a surplus of 9% of GDP. Over the past several years, Russia has used its stabilization fund based on oil taxes to prepay all Soviet-era sovereign debt to Paris Club creditors and the IMF. Foreign debt has decreased to 39% of GDP, mainly due to decreasing state debt, although commercial debt to foreigners has risen strongly. Oil export earnings have allowed Russia to increase its foreign reserves from $12 billion in 1999 to some $315 billion at yearend 2006, the third largest reserves in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also notes that Russian’s average real GDP per capita was only $12,100 – as compared to $43,500.  China’s real GDP per capita was only $7600.  The CIA World Factbook writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>China&#8217;s economy during the last quarter century has changed from a centrally planned system that was largely closed to international trade to a more market-oriented economy that has a rapidly growing private sector and is a major player in the global economy. Reforms started in the late 1970s with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, the foundation of a diversified banking system, the development of stock markets, the rapid growth of the non-state sector, and the opening to foreign trade and investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>China – like Russia – has a higher national savings rate than does the U.S.  Conventional Solow like growth models suggests a convergence hypothesis where nations that begin with a lower capital to labor ratio will grow faster than those with a higher capital to labor ratio even if the two nations have the same savings rates.  Add to this the fiscal irresponsibility that the U.S. had to endure during the Reagan and Bush43 Administration, which was accompanied by a reduction in our national savings rate, as compared to the higher national savings rates of China and Russia – is it any surprise that their growth rates have exceeded ours in the last few years?</p>
<p>Kevin ends noting that democracies are still in the same but their victory is not assured.  Let me respond by defining the game as a marathon where one runner ran the first 25 miles at a 5 minute pace only to hit the wall having to slow down to a 12 minute mile for the last mile and a quarter.  The other runner did the first 25 miles at a 9 minute pace so he could sprint the finish at a pace that was faster than a 5 minute mile.  This analogy describes the comparison of a nation with high income per capita growing at a rate less than 3% per year versus one with low income per capita growing at a rate around 7% per year.  In my running analogy, the first runner clearly won the race.  Likewise – anyone who thinks income per capita in China will be higher than it is in the U.S. any time soon is not thinking clearly.</p>

                                <p>Back when I was an adjunct professor, I had a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal. My opinion&#8230; their reporting is excellent, but their op eds are awful. Now that I don&#8217;t get the paper for free, I don&#8217;t read it&#8230; but some of their stuff appears online for free. Including this by <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010080">Bernard Lewis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the Cold War, two things came to be known and generally recognized in the Middle East concerning the two rival superpowers. If you did anything to annoy the Russians, punishment would be swift and dire. If you said or did anything against the Americans, not only would there be no punishment; there might even be some possibility of reward, as the usual anxious procession of diplomats and politicians, journalists and scholars and miscellaneous others came with their usual pleading inquiries: &#8220;What have we done to offend you? What can we do to put it right?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>These different responses evoked different treatment. While American policies, institutions and individuals were subject to unremitting criticism and sometimes deadly attack, the Soviets were immune. Their retention of the vast, largely Muslim colonial empire accumulated by the czars in Asia passed unnoticed, as did their propaganda and sometimes action against Muslim beliefs and institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>We in the Western world see the defeat and collapse of the Soviet Union as a Western, more specifically an American, victory in the Cold War. For Osama bin Laden and his followers, it was a Muslim victory in a jihad, and, given the circumstances, this perception does not lack plausibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>From the writings and the speeches of Osama bin Laden and his colleagues, it is clear that they expected this second task, dealing with America, would be comparatively simple and easy. This perception was certainly encouraged and so it seemed, confirmed by the American response to a whole series of attacks&#8211;on the World Trade Center in New York and on U.S. troops in Mogadishu in 1993, on the U.S. military office in Riyadh in 1995, on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, on the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000&#8211;all of which evoked only angry words, sometimes accompanied by the dispatch of expensive missiles to remote and uninhabited places.</p>
<p>Stage One of the jihad was to drive the infidels from the lands of Islam; Stage Two&#8211;to bring the war into the enemy camp, and the attacks of 9/11 were clearly intended to be the opening salvo of this stage. The response to 9/11, so completely out of accord with previous American practice, came as a shock, and it is noteworthy that there has been no successful attack on American soil since then. The U.S. actions in Afghanistan and in Iraq indicated that there had been a major change in the U.S., and that some revision of their assessment, and of the policies based on that assessment, was necessary. </p>
<p>More recent developments, and notably the public discourse inside the U.S., are persuading increasing numbers of Islamist radicals that their first assessment was correct after all, and that they need only to press a little harder to achieve final victory. It is not yet clear whether they are right or wrong in this view. If they are right, the consequences&#8211;both for Islam and for America&#8211;will be deep, wide and lasting.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I guess he&#8217;s saying, in plain English:<br />1. For the longest time, Muslims treated the Soviets with respect and disdained the Americans because the former were stronger and the latter acted weak<br />2. Defeating the Soviets was therefore a priority of Osama bin Laden <br />3. Once the Soviets were defeated, Osama and company thought the US weakling would be quickly defeated<br />4. The US attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq made Osama and company doubt item 3.<br />5. US wavering on Afghanistan and Iraq may yet prove Osama and company right, and if it does, we&#8217;ll all be wearing veils and bowing toward Mecca or some such outcome. </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not expert on the Middle East like Lewis. But I have a different take on things. I want to cover what seem to be his points.</p>
<p>1. Its possible at some point the Soviets were seen as stronger than the Americans. Certianly, most Arab countries cast their lots with the USSR. But by the mid-1970s, its hard to believe that anyone in the Middle East would regard that as having been a good bet. I understand that US military aid to Israel was relatively small before the 1973 War, and that in fact, before the 1970 &#8220;War of Attrition&#8221; Arab countries had actually received more US military aid than Israel had. </p>
<p>And then came 1973 and a surprise attack on Israel. A weak Israel &#8211; outgunned, with less soldiers, with less equipment, all of it older than anything in the Arab arsenals. (In some battles, Israeli units were using equipment from WW2, while their Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian counterparts were using five year old Soviet planes and tanks.) The Arabs also had Soviet training and support. And yet, despite engaging in a surprise attack on Israel, a few weeks later these same countries had to count on US pressure to stop the Israelis&#8230; about 60 miles from Cairo and Damascus, with the much of the Egyptian Army cut off, surrounded, and days from annihilation.</p>
<p>The shock of this turn of events was very damaging to the Arab psyche. And the fact that Soviet doctrine, equipment, training, and advice had failed was lost on nobody in the region. Arab governments continued to receive Soviet assistance&#8230; but out of lack of choice. By then they had made their beds and had to lie in it.</p>
<p>2. Defeating the infidel was a priority for Osama. Why would he have started in Afghanistan? Easy&#8230; of every place where infidels could be found, it was where they were weakest. The ones with the lousiest equipment and worst training (as proven before), in a place where they couldn&#8217;t control their supply lines. If the goal was simply to fight infidels, he could have done that in Israel. The PLO or the PFLP would have taken him in a moment. He could even have worked on taking down the House of Saud, and not left home at all. But even this was more difficult than fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>3. There is talk, and there is propaganda. In 1973, Arab radio stations were broadcasting that &#8220;pushing the Jews into the sea&#8221; was right around the corner even after events on the ground made that impossible under any circumstance. Heck, US news sources were reporting on how well things going in Iraq until around September of last year. </p>
<p>4. Well, least for a while, which leads to&#8230;</p>
<p>5. If the US had performed as advertised &#8211; and we all remember we were promised a cakewalk, Osama and company wouldn&#8217;t be so bold. But where are we? Afghanistan doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; our puppet regime controls 20 square miles around Kabul, and that&#8217;s when US soldiers pretend he does. As to Iraq&#8230; the pro-establishment Chatham House <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6663935.stm">just issued a report saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he Iraqi government is now largely powerless and irrelevant in many parts of the country. </p>
<p>It warns there is not one war but many local civil wars, and urges a major change in US and British strategy, such as consulting Iraq&#8217;s neighbours more. </p></blockquote>
<p>What emboldens Osama and company is that the US fails. At this point, GW isn&#8217;t going to pull a rabbit out of the Iraqi hat. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there is no hope but a US failure in the eyes of Osama and company&#8230; another option is simple. Pull out of Iraq. Declare we did what we intended to do, but don&#8217;t want stay when its clear we&#8217;re fomenting a Civil War (or many). Instead, what Lewis should be advocating is to move the troops to Afghanistan. Do what the Soviets failed to do&#8230; beat Osama. Make Afghanistan work. If he&#8217;s so concerned about showing weakness to Osama, here&#8217;s a way to salvage a victory.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Talking Points Memo has a <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/leahy-gonzales-subpoena/">letter from Patrick Leahy</a> to Alberto Gonzalez:</p>
<blockquote><p>You did not appear before the Committee or produce any documents and you have provided no explanation for your failure to do so.  Today at 2 p.m. was the return date and time for you to appear before the Committee and bring with you the documents compelled by the Judiciary Committee&#8217;s May 2 subpoena.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Administration has ignored laws before, and has said that it would ignore various subpoenas in the past.  Some of the recent evidence that members of the Executive have provided to Congress, even under oath, seems to be at least less than truthful and might even be considered perjury should someone be interested in prosecuting.  And here we have an example of a subpoena by Congress simply being ignored.</p>
<p>In each case, the explanation tends to be something that in plain English amounts to:  &#8220;The Administration feels that complying with this will unconstitutionally interfere with the powers of the executive&#8221; or &#8220;The Administration feels that compling with this will hurt the country in the war on terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>What stops GW from doing this any time he feels like it from now on?  For instance, if November 2008 comes around and the American public elects a &#8220;surrendocrat&#8221; as President, what keeps GW from simply refusing to step down on the grounds that doing so will embolden Osama?  </p>
<p>In the end, there is nothing to compel compliance except the fragile thread that is democratic tradition and Will.  Congress&#8217; failure to exert any oversight for the past few years has frayed the democratic thread to the snapping point.  And what is the Will that is left?  That is the Will of someone who would retain power beyond the limits of the Constitution, the Will of those whose support he/she would need, and the Will of the people to oppose him/her.</p>
<p>I hasten to add&#8230; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in any danger of that happening.  Even if the thought occurred to him to behave in such a way, GW seems to be more or less demoralized.  Why would he want to cling to power beyond January 2009 if that means he&#8217;d still have to find the solution to Iraq and Afghanistan that has eluded him so far?   Those who would have to support him &#8211; well, GW does have his supporters.  </p>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU0NGQ0ZTQzZTU4Zjk4MjdjZWMzYTM4Nzk2MzQ0MGI=">Thomas Sowell</a> and his ilk might support GW becoming a dictator, but I don&#8217;t see the military or the rest of the security apparatus going along at this point.  As to the people&#8230; I don&#8217;t think they enter into the calculation at all.  If GW did feel like it, and the military/security apparatus did go along with it, tens of thousands of marchers here and there would make no difference.</p>
<p>But what worries me is that just because GW is incompetent, demoralized, and lacking in support by any except the most irrational 28% by the end of his term doesn&#8217;t mean the next guy to push the envelope will be.  The time for &#8220;we the people&#8221; to have agitated was before the precedent was set.  Now, what is left is the Will of the President and the Will of those who would have to support him.</p>
