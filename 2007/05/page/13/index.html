<p>Shouldn’t <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/07/AR2007050701582.html">Lori Montgomery</a> be writing for the National Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, spending in Iraq amounted to less than 1 percent of the total economy … Total defense spending is 4 percent of gross domestic product, the figure that measures the nation&#8217;s economic output. In contrast, defense spending ate up 14 percent of GDP at the height of the Korean War and 9 percent during the Vietnam War.  And this time, the war bill is going directly on the nation&#8217;s credit card. Unlike his predecessors, Bush is financing a major conflict without raising taxes or making significant cuts in domestic programs. Instead, he has cut taxes and run up the national debt. The result, economists said, is a war that has barely dented the average American&#8217;s pocketbook and caused few reverberations in the broader economy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/05/guns_butter_and.html">Mark Thoma</a> also notes that Ms. Montgomery claims that the cost of this war did not lead to the “guns and butter” problem or higher interest rates.   Mark also objects to the omission of the cost of human lives.  While Mark is right to raise the human cost of this failed military adventure, but let’s stick to the macroeconomics.  Three simple points:</p>
<p>1) Defense spending in 2006 was $621 billion according to <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>.  That’s 4.7% of GDP – not the 4% that Montgomery’s sources told her (I guess she thinks Karl Rove is a reliable source).</p>
<p>2) The rising debt does represent an increased in deferred taxes – which will dent the pocketbooks of Americans at some point.</p>
<p>3) Her implicit claim that interest rates have not increased since the start of the war isn’t quite true.</p>
<p>Now one can argue that this war began at a time when we were below full employment.  But as we approached full employment, the Federal Reserve did decide to raise interest rates.</p>

                                <p>Last night, Stormy had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/globalization-multinationals-us-wages.html">post</a> in which he quoted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/globalization-multinationals-us-wages.html">Robert Reich</a> who stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s largest corporations have decoupled from the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point made by Stormy and Reich is that companies are acting in the best interests of their shareholders, and that hasn&#8217;t (lately) benefited US workers in general. Now, in finance class, you&#8217;re told that&#8217;s what companies are supposed to do: benefit their shareholders by maximizing profits. </p>
<p>Kind of apropos of nothing (its certainly not related to the point made by Stormy or Reich)&#8230; as ownership gets more diffuse (through 401-Ks and the like), what happens if a company&#8217;s actions to maximize its own profits (on behalf of its shareholders) requires it to act in ways that harm the shareholders (economically and/or otherwise)? Does the company still have the moral obligation to maximize its profits in that case?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan continues his series on water issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5690e/y5690e08.htm">Many legal, institutional, and administrative preconditions</a> such as the need for enforcement mechanisms, clear methods of complaint/dispute resolution and administrative transparency, are common to any pricing tool. (my emphasis) However, volume-based, demand management tools require infrastructure capable of volumetric measurement.</p>
<p>Sampath (1992) observes that pricing is dependent on type of physical delivery system suggesting that volumetric pricing is only possible under demand and closed pipe systems as opposed to rotation and continuous flow systems. However Malano and van Hofwegen (1999) take a broader view and describe the classes of service delivery including all the on-request (or arranged) types of delivery. In practice there is a wide range and mix of delivery services and service standard negotiation. The extent to which different service modalities are arranged in such projects as VWRAP, cited above, indicate the complexity of the issue. However. even though there may well be potential for changed patterns of water delivery, volumetric pricing to farmers does not appear suitable on the vast majority of surface irrigation systems in developing countries &#8211; including all those where rice is grown. In the case of VWRAP, it is anticipated that at the level of the water user associations, there will be contracts specifying volumetric deliveries, but no volumetric pricing as such. The primary emphasis is on delivering an agreed level of service and building the capacity of the service provider to do so by modernizing management and infrastructure.</p>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em><br />Many social, political, economic, cultural and geographical factors affect pricing and production, highlighting the diversity of irrigation systems in general. Thus, various commentators emphasize the need to take diversity into account when implementing water pricing. Molle (2001) points out that economists could come to face similar criticism to engineers for being too discipline-oriented and unrealistic. Ahmad (2000) emphasizes: ‘There is not a general strategy or model to adopt for a specific water pricing policy of a country. Every country has to develop its own strategy.’ There is a danger of pursuing a ‘one-model-fits-all approach’ because administrators find such an approach easier to implement. Therefore, there needs to be a change of attitude within agencies implementing reforms.</p>
<p>I want to reinforce Bruce Webb’s and MG’s comments as well as my own with this note from my last post. I thought drinking water and agriculture needed separate evaluations aside from the food issues themselves. One is the delivery as a closed pipe system from source to customer as is more common for drinking water systems.</p>
<p>Another for agricultural use that one day might have to be closed pipe like oil as water might be treated as a scarce commodity, but currently is not as open irrigation schemes consider water as a relatively non-scarce commodity.</p>
<p>The difficulties to consider in capitalization of infrastructure with varied market and needs of different locales is complex.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional issues make for a fragmentation that might be necessary instead of something to iron out as in the WTO GATS format. Benefits and costs with a very special need to guarantee proper regulation is a pre-requisite. These are normal preconditions to ANY pricing strategy, and involve negotiation by the parties involved. Current WTO GATS 2000 expansion needs a look.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As a newly married guy, I figured it was time to redo some legal stuff&#8230; will, medical power of attorney, etc. At some point in the process, you always think about children. I have none, but I remembered a conversation I had with some friends a few months back on paternity fraud. From an article on <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1144414531354">Paternity Fraud</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>According to a recent study in New Hampshire, as many as 30 percent of those paying child support are not the biological fathers of the children being supported.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Michigan State University Law Professor Melanie Jacobs cautions states about passing new paternity-fraud laws, arguing children could get hurt in the long run. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think the problem with those laws is that, No. 1, they need to consider a child&#8217;s best interest. I&#8217;m not trying to minimize the trauma to the nonbiological father, his feeling of betrayal,&#8221; Jacobs said. </p>
<p>&#8220;But I can only imagine how traumatic it is for the child who learns that someone is not their father, and suddenly that father goes to court and says not only do I not want to pay for this child&#8217;s [upbringing], I want to legally be declared the nonfather,&#8221; Jacobs added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, it seems that in many cases, if its considered in the best interest of the child, a man who was fraudulently fooled into thinking he was the child&#8217;s father is forced to continue paying child support even when he has evidence that he is not the father. In most cases, the &#8220;father&#8221; has no custody and no &#8220;rights&#8221; to see the child. In some (many?) cases, the father has never even met the child. In a few cases, the father has never even met the mother of the child. Which leads me to a few questions:</p>
<p>1. Wouldn&#8217;t it be even more in the best interest of the child to force Bill Gates to pay child support? I don&#8217;t see how Bill Gates should have any less obligation than any other random dude that isn&#8217;t the child&#8217;s father, and surely Bill could afford it more than most.</p>
<p>2. How is a judge forcing someone to pay child support on a child that isn&#8217;t his and who he will never meet any different from a judge forcing someone to make the car payments or mortgage for a randomly selected random stranger?</p>
<p>3. If I had to guess, the numbers are higher in the US than in places like Europe that candidates like Mitt Romney point to as being morally decadent. Anyone have anything that look like real figures?</p>

                                <p>The Philippines beats out China in a bid for a $1 billion dollar Texas Instrument semi-conductor test and manufacturing plant.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>We have broken the myth of China here</i>,&#8221; said Ernie Santiago, executive director of the Semiconductor and Electronics Industry in the Philippines, Inc. (SEIPI).</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed before all roads are going to China, but we have made a point here that the Philippines is also a smart choice for investment.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;China myth&#8221; is that China is the best export platform for multinationals. Whether it has been broken is still an open question. Other developing countries, such as the Philippines, are doing their best to compete with China as export platforms. India will certainly give China a run for its money.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BT/Monday/Corporate/BT621448.txt/Article/">Business Times</a>, Robert Sears, the executive director of American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, said:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;What the Texas Instruments deal shows is that the Philippines can compete with the best of them if it wants to.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>By the &#8220;best of them,&#8221; I am sure Sears meant China.</p>
<p>The choice of the Philippines over was made for number of reasons, a few of which might be of interest to AngryBear readers:
<ul>
<li>Philippine corporate income tax is only five per cent of gross income earned compared with the normal rate of 32 per cent. (China competes well in this area.)</li>
<li>Philippine import of capital equipment and raw materials is duty free.</li>
<li>China has hidden costs: due diligence on local partners or suppliers and the cost and quality of life for expatriate staff. (This may be China&#8217;s problem.)</li>
<li>China is not yet a consumer market; hence, the choice of the Philippines was made on other factors. (See below how the new plant will affect Philippine exports.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Texas Instruments has another plant in the Philippines (Baguio) which &#8220;accounted for 35 to 40 percent of Texas Instrument&#8217;s Revenue, which was US$3.2 billion for the first quarter of the year.&#8221;<br />According to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070503/bs_nm/philippines_texas_dc_5">Yahoo News</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Philippines supplies about 10 percent of the world&#8217;s semiconductor manufacturing services, including mobile phone chips and microprocessors. Texas Instruments and Intel Corpare two of the biggest companies with manufacturing plants in the country.</p>
<p><i>Texas Instruments&#8217; exports from the Philippines last year totalled US$3.5 billion, which could double once the Clark site is operational.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The Philippine minimum wage varies by region but the national daily average wage is around P283. In Metro Manila, the minimum wage is P350 a day. See <a href="http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2007/jan24.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of U.S. dollars, average wage is $5.98/day; minimum wage in metro Manila is $7.40/day.</p>
<p>What is so interesting about TI&#8217;s choice? First, the U.S. was not in the running, for obvious, important business reasons. Second, the choice was between China and the Philippines. Third, TI is an American company. Fourth, even though China was in the running and is an export platform for American companies, the Philippines may be, in this case, a better export platform.</p>
<p>When Krugman laments that &#8220;high profits have not led to high [U.S.] investment,&#8221; he should look at the portfolios and investment decisions of companies like TI.</p>
<p>When Krugman complains about companies not interested in rewarding labor, he should understand that TI is not interested in rewarding U.S. labor for work done by Philippine labor.</p>
<p>When Krugman thinks U.S. investment is low because U.S. economic outlook is &#8220;cloudy,&#8221; he does not understand that in the global arena, investment decisions are not based on the economic outlook of a particular country; rather those decisions are based on the global economic outlook.</p>
<p>Too often, our view of the world is U.S.-centric.</p>
<p>Some will say that I am overly generalizing using one U.S. company. I suggest that they read carefully the quotations above. Clearly, Ernie Santigo would agree with me. Furthermore, I suggest they look at Delphi, at Intel, at Apple, at Dell&#8230;at a host of other multinationals. China may be the biggest magnet for multinationals, but it is far from the only magnet.</p>
<p>Until we confront this reality, we will continue to do nothing for the American worker or for stagnant wages. <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2007/05/record-breaking-dow-and-supply-side.html">Robert Reich</a> understands when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s largest corporations have decoupled from the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to this dilemma is not an easy one. Brad Setser sees the answer as revaluation of the yuan. That may handle China, but I am not sure. Others see the answer in &#8220;re-training&#8221; or education. I do not think that is the answer.<br />My answer involves four lines of approach:
<ol>
<li>Refashion WTO principles so that the rights of workers to organize and bargain are part of the fundamental groundwork of all participating nations. Workers rights world-wide need protection. <i>Guarantee Chinese workers&#8217; rights; you improve U.S. wages.</i></li>
<li>The U.S. must seriously address its health care issue. The cost to business is excessive.</li>
<li>We must think through the tax and other incentives that countries offer. I have no simple solution here. Companies play one country off another in a race to the bottom. Some parameters may be needed. Again, the WTO.</li>
<li>Currency manipulation has to be addressed. Again, the answer is not simply &#8220;let the yuan float freely.&#8221; In order for some countries to &#8220;catch-up,&#8221; a &#8220;loose but rising&#8221; peg may be necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple protectionist measures may be counterproductive. It is far better to deal with the root of the problem than to treat the symptons.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, trade and account imbalances pose a serious long-term threat to world economic well-being. Capital is mobile. As the wages and standard of living start to rise in one country, capital will simply trot off to a cheaper place.</p>
<p>I am happy that Mexico decided to send us a tortilla factory.</p>

The terms of the contract, fixed price, were enforced and the government demanded the contractor repay the government for money paid for “progress” not achieved.</p>
<p>If only the contracts managers working the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, or any number of failed weapons, had realized the developers were no likely to meet the terms and conditions of the contract, as upheld by this judge, there would be less waste in the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Court Backs Pentagon In Killing Fighter Jet</p>
<p>By Renae Merle, Washington Post Staff Writer</p>
<p>“A federal judge sided with the government yesterday over General Dynamics and Boeing in a 16-year saga over a canceled fighter-jet program.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. Court of Federal Claims upheld the government&#8217;s 1991 decision to terminate the companies&#8217; contract for the A-12 radar-evading plane, General Dynamics and Boeing said.”<br />“The &#8220;contracting officer could have concluded that McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics had &#8216;no reasonable likelihood&#8217; of delivering the aircraft on time as measured by the schedule,&#8221; Judge Robert H. Hodges wrote in the decision. McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997. &#8220;We must again uphold the Government&#8217;s default termination.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In 2002, the Navy told General Dynamics and Boeing to pay $2.3 billion to settle the case, which the companies refused to do. That demand included $1 billion in interest.”</p>
<p>Today, the contracting officers look out for the profits of the contractors, look the other way at failed performance, and allow more time and vastly increased cost while the systems do not perform.</p>
<p>Some contracting officer should have determined that any numbers of weapon systems (B-2, C-17, MV 22, F/A-18E/F,…..) that were not being designed to meet required performance, on time and at the required cost.</p>
<p>But defense contracts are not legal obligations to deliver performance they are locked solid demands on the treasury despite the failure of the vendors to meet any obligations.</p>

<p>Governor Kathleen Sebelius said much of the National Guard equipment usually positioned around the state to respond to emergencies is gone. She said not having immediate access to things like tents, trucks and semitrailers will really handicap the rebuilding effort.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We have a pretty good idea of how many Americans will turn 62 and start collecting Social Security in 2068, because they’ve all been born, and we can estimate with near certainty how many will die then and, with a bigger but tolerable margin of error, how many will immigrate from foreign countries. The Social Security Trustees’ report issued on April 23 paints a pretty clear picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can estimate all of the relevant factors with near certainty?  Then why do we bother with three scenarios?  Then again, Barone has trouble reading any of these forecasts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security costs will exceed Social Security revenues by 2017. That’s a big problem, because for years Social Security revenues &#8211; FICA taxes &#8211; have been far greater than the cost of benefits, and so those monies have in effect been spent on other federal programs. But roundabout 2017 &#8211; that’s just ten years away &#8211; we’ll have to dip into other revenues, or borrow or increase taxes, to pay Social Security recipients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Mr. Barone did not see that table showing that the Social Security Trust Fund balances will be between 300% and 500% of annual payouts in 2017 depending on which scenario one uses.  That’s a big problem?</p>

<blockquote><p>Many many years ago when I was a recently minted assistant professor, I heard Gary Hufbauer tell an anecdote at a conference on international trade. A government economist is called in by his superior, who tells him &#8220;Look, I have to make a case for this policy in front of Congress, and I need a number real bad.&#8221;  The economist responds, &#8220;well, I haven&#8217;t done a proper analysis, so I can give you a real bad number.&#8221; Perhaps it was a true story based on Gary&#8217;s own government experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll have to pin this to the wall of my office and think about it every time a read some alleged evidence that seems to be inflated.  Dani was thinking about a recent post from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/05/the_benefits_fr.html">Mark Thoma</a> on the benefits from trade, which noted a paper written by Gary Hufbauer and two other authors that was cited by Ben Bernanke.

<blockquote><p>Since World War II the United States has led the international quest to liberalize world trade and investment. With leadership from the White House, Congress has slashed the simple average tariff rate from 40 percent in 1946 to 4 percent today, and other industrial nations have done much the same. After a half-century of steady liberalization it is fair to ask, what do Americans have to show?  As it turns out, quite a lot. Using four different methods, we estimate that the combination of shrinking distances &#8211; thanks to container ships, telecommunications and other new technologies &#8211; and lower political barriers to international trade and investment have generated an increase in U.S. income of roughly $1 trillion a year (measured in 2003 dollars), or about 10 percent of gross domestic product. This translates to a gain in annual income of about $10,000 per household.</p></blockquote>
<p>Efficiency gains on the order of $10,000 per household or 10% of GDP sound almost too good to be true.  Dani thinks they are and explains what may have lead to such incredibly high estimates.  He also walks us through an alternative methodology for estimating the gains from trade:</p>
<blockquote><p>The standard partial equilibrium formula for calculating the gains from moving to free trade is 0.5 x [t/(1+t)]^2 x m x e, where t is the tariff rate, m is the share of imports in GDP, and e is the (absolute value of the price elasticity of import demand).  In the U.S.  average tariffs stand in low single digits and imports are less than 20% of GDP. There is no way of tweaking this formula under reasonable elasticities that would get us a number anywhere near the Bradford et al. estimates. For example, using the generous numbers t = 0.10, m = 0.2 and e = 3, the gains from moving to complete free trade are a meager 0.25% of GDP (compared to Bradford et al.&#8217;s lowest estimate of 3.4% of GDP).</p></blockquote>
<p>Dani notes the shortcomings of the simple approach as well as some research that tries to address these shortcomings.  In general, when alternative procedures exist for estimating anything give such wildly different results, one should closely scrutinize each methodology before touting the results of any procedure that does appear to reach an extreme conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003041.html">Max Sawicky</a> also picks up on Dani’s post as well as the sensible argument that not everyone gains from free trade.  None of this stops Max from calling Lou Dobbs a nitwit:</p>
<blockquote><p>I caught the Lou Dobbs segment on 60 Minutes last night, which I hardly ever watch. His hysteria level about immigrants undermines whatever usefulness he has about trade. As for industrial policy, one logical arena for dealing with globalization, does he have any? I don&#8217;t think so. He&#8217;s a lot like Pat Buchanan, albeit without the racism/sexism/homophobia/anti-semitism. It doesn&#8217;t help that Lesley Stahl lent him credbility by throwing hostile, stupid questions at him.</p></blockquote>
<p>I often do watch 60 Minutes but for some reason I felt compelled to watch Tim Russert interview George Tenet.  Guess my choice was the lesser of two evils.</p>
