<p><a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/05/sowells_coup.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> catches Sowell writing something amazing:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I see the worsening degeneracy in our politicians, our media, our educators, and our intelligentsia, I can’t help wondering if the day may yet come when the only thing that can save this country is a military coup.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Many conservatives suggest that Social Security should be there for those who want to participate in it, but those who don&#8217;t want to participate in it should be allowed to opt out and do their own investing for their retirement. It sounds like a reasonable suggestion, but it ignores one detail. </p>
<p>Social Security is not just a retirement program, it is an insurance program. One type of insurance provided by Social Security are a guarantee to pay children and families some amount of money every month should their parent die. Another is to provide payment to a child for its whole life should it have some debilitating disease that does not allow it to work.</p>
<p>But it is a strange kind of insurance program &#8211; it only collects premiums once someone is able to earn income.</p>
<p>Which means&#8230;. if one were allowed to opt out of the system upon reaching that point, one will never pay for the value of the insurance received as a child. (Obviously, those children that are not able to work upon growing up would never opt out of the system.) This is the equivalent of having a home-owner&#8217;s insurance policy for which one can defer payment for twenty odd years. Then, at the end of the twenty odd years, one decides the insurance wasn&#8217;t necessary, and cancelling, while refusing to pay for the insurance policy one had up until to that point.</p>
<p>So&#8230; I think people should be allowed to opt out of the system. But they should be required to pay for that health insurance policy they used first.</p>

Stormy fires off some <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-about-us-investment-abroad.html">theoretical tale</a> that we would expect a lot of U.S. direct investment in China.  Fine – but that leaves a big puzzle as to what is happening in the real world, which my data suggested and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/05/the_china_syndr.html">Paul Krugman</a> also noted.  </p>
<p>If AB readers are frustrated with this spat between me and Stormy – you have a right to be.  But readers of this blog also have a right to expect our posts to be based on the data.  Theories are fine – and I have no problem with Stormy’s latest theory, but Paul Krugman was try to have us focus on the evidence.  Please don’t insult him for doing so.</p>

                                <p>Movie Guy who is superior to me in research provides the following from the GAO report GAO-06-349 on EFV reliability 2 May 2006:</p>
<p> &#8220;In 2005, the Marine Corps received approval to lower the EFV&#8217;s reliability requirement from 70 hours before maintenance is needed to 43.5 hours before maintenance is needed.[Footnote 10] This decision was based on a revised analysis of the EFV&#8217;s mission profile and the vehicle&#8217;s demonstrated reliability. At the start of SDD, the EFV&#8217;s operational reliability requirement was 70 hours of operation before maintenance is needed. Program officials told us this 70-hour requirement was based on the EFV&#8217;s mission profile at the time, which called for a &#8220;do-all&#8221; mission for one 24.3 hour period of operation.”</p>
<p>The Marine Corps has dumbed down reliability requirements.  This will increase maintenance costs, demand more marines on the ship be maintenance men and women rather than riflemen, mean there are fewer vehicles in the line for combat each day, with more spares, support equipment and training delays.  To say nothing of increased support costs and burdened lines of communication.  GAO does not go here.</p>
<p>Here is another quote:</p>
<p>“Unit costs have increased from $8.5 million to $12.3 million. The Program schedule has grown 35 percent or 4 years, and its reliability Requirement has been reduced from 70 hours of continuous operation to 43.5 hours (it is testing to 24 hours, usually better in tests than in use). Program difficulties occurred in part because not enough time was allowed to demonstrate maturity of the EFV design during SDD.”</p>
<p>Not only dumbed down in performance but unit costs are rising too.  If the unit vehicle cost is $12 million dollars (about the price of 15 Lamborghini’s, not telling how many meals for the hungry) then the 20 year operation costs could be close to $36 million per vehicle to have a major breakdown every 24 operating hours, is quite expensive.  GAO does not go here.<br />Figure 3 shows estimates of acquisition costs, for FY 2006 through 2011, for the EFV to be $8.6 B in 2001 when the design was mature enough to tell the designers to build articles representing the hardware and software for test, to $12.1 B in 2006, a 45% cost increase, while the thing was “rebaselined”, less performance more costs 3 times since 2001.</p>
<p>On page 26 the GAO makes a short comment on “defects” delaying deliveries and increased support and production costs.</p>
<p>At what point, with rising costs and declining performance, is the EFV no longer worth the expenditure of scarce our resources?</p>
<p>Is the thing so vital that it will be bought despite the cost and the reduced usefulness?</p>
<p>GAO does not investigate beyond the limited issue of rising acquisition costs and does not evaluate impacts due to degraded reliability; if they did they may be more useful.</p>

<blockquote><p>NEW ORLEANS &#8211; When the Army Corps of Engineers solicited bids for drainage pumps for New Orleans, it copied the specifications — typos and all — from the catalog of the manufacturer that ultimately won the $32 million contract, a review of documents by The Associated Press found.</p>
<p>The pumps, supplied by Moving Water Industries Corp. of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and installed at canals before the start of the 2006 hurricane season, proved to be defective, as the AP reported in March. The matter is under investigation by the    Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.</p>
<p>In a letter dated April 13, Sen. David Vitter (news, bio, voting record), R-La., called on the Corps to look into how the politically connected company got the post-Hurricane Katrina contract. MWI employed former Florida Gov.  Jeb Bush,        President Bush&#8217;s brother, to market its pumps during the 1980s, and top MWI officials have been major contributors to the Republican Party.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Economists who claim that trade surpluses in developing countries, i.e., China and elsewhere, have nothing to do with corporate profits have not looked closely at what is happening. Do they think that suddenly these countries developed manufacturing skills comparable to the developed nations, that suddenly China, for example, has become a major exporter of IT products without the presence of global corporations?</p>
<p>Can they explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>why corporate profits rise as median wages in the U.S. stagnate?</li>
<li>the U.S. trade deficit as a function of high corporate profits?</li>
<li>how China suddenly has become one of the leading IT exporters?</li>
</ul>
<p>Have those who depend on FDI data ever done a survey of what our multinationals are doing in China? Do they understand that China is an export platform?</p>
<p>Do they understand the difference between FDI in China and FDI in the U.S.? Or are they simply comparing apples and oranges? Putting up an automobile plant in the states is expensive. Are the costs similar in China?</p>
<p>China enjoys a trade surplus with the U.S. What does the U.S. send to China? In 2005, the top four U.S. exports to China were: aircraft products ($41b), semiconductors and other electrical parts ($4.5b), waste and scrap ($3.7b), soybeans ($2.3).</p>
<p>Without question, China has become an assembly plant. The question is: Where does it go from here? And what is happening in China?</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf">Sam Palmisano</a>, IBM CEO, said</p>
<p>
<blockquote>By one estimate, between 2000 and 2003 alone, foreign firms built 60,000 manufacturing plants in China. Some of these factories target the local Chinese market, but others target the global market. European chemical companies, Japanese carmakers, and U.S. industrial conglomerates are all building (or have declared their intention to build) factories in China to supply export markets around the world. Similarly, banks, insurance companies, professional-service firms, and it companies are building R &#038; D and service centers in India to support employees, customers, and production worldwide&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>he was certainly supporting the view of China and India as export platforms for multinationals.</p>
<p>And whom are we to believe, those who cite the BEA with its antiquated and flawed measure of FDI as a measure or <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200602/15/eng20060215_243015.html">Yi Xiaozhun</a>, China’s Vice Commerce Minister when he says,</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Foreign-funded enterprises in China enjoyed 83 percent if China&#8217;s total foreign trade surplus and accounted for 58 percent of China&#8217;s total exports, announced Vice Commerce Minister Yi Xiaozhun at China-US Business Forum in Beijing on Feb. 14, 2006</p></blockquote>
<p>Yi went on to say that</p>
<p>
<blockquote>that foreign investors remitted some 270 billion US dollars of their profits out of China, which did not include much of their profits used for reinvestment</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same article, the American Chamber of Commerce in China states:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>American companies, in particular, stood out due to their strong competitiveness. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in 2004 shows that 86 percent of US businesses in China saw their earnings increase and <i>42 percent of them made more profits in China than globally</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are those profits from Chinese markets? I don&#8217;t think so. Consider this <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601093&#038;refer=home&#038;sid=aHdszWoQEitA">description</a> of a giant China mall:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The world&#8217;s largest shopping center looks almost deserted on a recent afternoon. While schoolchildren ride the sidewinder and roller coaster, there are few shoppers and fewer tenants at South China Mall in central Dongguan, a city of 6 million north of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did this mall all wrong,&#8221; says Stephen Liu, a Hong Kong businessman visiting clients in Dongguan who came by to see the place for himself. &#8220;They never found out if there were enough people to fill it. All the Chinese in this town are factory workers, they can&#8217;t afford to shop here.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The Chinese are not buying. Those who are not too poor to buy, save. What is happening? Simple: China is an export platform. We are the consumers. Who are the major corporations manufacturing the goods in China? Simple: Often ours!</p>
<p>In fact,according to <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200703/17/eng20070317_358589.html">Wu Xioling</a>, deputy governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China:</p>
<p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>a major part of China&#8217;s trade surplus is created by multinationals as they eye low labor costs in the country and choose to produce their labor-intensive products in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in the same article, but this time citing Mei Xinu, trade expert with the Ministry of Commerce:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The fact is that China&#8217;s trade surplus mainly comes from the manufacturing industry and that most exports by large multinationals have been included in China&#8217;s trade figures. <i>A high proportion of export profits in fact stay in the pockets of multinationals.</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly Yi and Wu have a better understanding of what is happening in China than anyone in this blog or this country, or those who rely on the FDI BEA data.</p>
<p>Yi’s understanding of the nature of China’s trade is a bit more reliable. How much of China trade is FDI driven. The answer: Close to sixty per cent.</p>
<p>Consider again the <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200602/15/eng20060215_243015.html">following</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>American companies, in particular, stood out due to their strong competitiveness. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in 2004 shows that 86 percent of US businesses in China saw their earnings increase and 42 percent of them made more profits in China than globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Acquisitions and mergers inside of China happen daily, with multinationals buying or merging or setting up partnerships with local firms. Note the <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/detail.asp?ID=89475&#038;GRP=E">following</a>:</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions of Chinese firms: June 30,2005-June 30,2006<br />U.S&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. 5.37 billion<br />U.K&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..3.46 billion<br />Singapore&#8230;. 1.84 billion<br />Belgium&#8230;&#8230; 764 million<br />Hong Kong&#8230;. 584 million<br />Germany&#8230;&#8230; 399 million<br />France&#8230;&#8230;. 321 million<br />Japan&#8230;&#8230;.. 242 million</p>
<p>This merger and acquisition activity, by the way, is of concern to China.</p>
<p>But the counter to what is happening is always FDI. Forget about Yi and other Chinese experts; forget the mergers and acquisitions occurring in China; forget about trade and how it is really functions; forget about off-shoring, out-sourcing, and the myriad annoying facts. Forget about how an impoverished nation can suddenly become an economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>What about FDI?</p>
<p>Looking at FDI levels without any further metrics or measures of what FDI investments involve and achieve in terms of value-added production and market development is misleading, comparing apples to oranges. For this reason, BEA FDI data alone isn&#8217;t the magic answer. Go look at the corporate SEC filings that corporations make in order to determine what is really happening. Read the corporate business plans. Enter the realities of the business world. Economists are not businessmen.</p>
<p>Why do comparative FDI statistics fail as good metric?</p>
<p>FDI in developing nations brings a far higher rate of return than in developed countries. Take China, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap labor. As I pointed out in an earlier <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_angrybear_archive.html">piece</a>, the average iPod worker in a Chinese SEZ makes approximately .60/hour. Yes, that is where your iPod comes from. SEZ’s are perfect manufacturing platforms for foreign firms.</li>
<li>Taxes. Foreign firms in China can receive up to a ten-year tax holiday. More importantly, they are taxed at half the rate of indigenous firms. Now, you mean to tell me that those indigenous Chinese firms have suddenly stepped onto the world stage and are now competing with multinational American corporations when they are taxed at twice the rate?</li>
</ul>
<p>FDI cannot measure how profits within a multinationals are allocated. How FDI is reported&#8211;or even measured&#8211;is antiquated and flawed. Global corporations can and do shift profits from one branch or division to another. It&#8217;s called book-keeping, transfer pricing, black matter, take your pick. FDI cannot and does not reflect these &#8220;nuances.&#8221;</p>
<p>In summary, FDI is not a good measurement of what is happening. It fails to explain rising corporate profits and our growing trade deficit. It fails to account for differing returns on FDI. It fails to explain the gutting of our manufacturing sector or where those companies have gone. It fails to explain the growing disparity of wealth both here and abroad. It fails to identify the the real sources of corporate profits.</p>
<p>Those who forward this argument chose to ignore Chinese economists and major U.S. CEO’s who are where “the action is.”</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_17/b4031048.htm">quotation</a> says it all:</p>

<blockquote>Today, however, virtually every major company is trying to reduce costs and get closer to fast-growing markets by spreading manufacturing operations and research facilities around the world. As a result, a U.S.-centric view of capital spending, says Steven R. Appleton, CEO of Micron, is &#8220;almost meaningless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Or to put the FDI argument another way: Comparing FDI investments made in the U.S. and China by corporations solely on a dollar basis overlooks the differences in what corporations can achieve with the same pile of dollars. FDI investments in China go a lot further in terms of acquisition and corporate rates of return. Otherwise, why are there thousands upon thousands of U.S. corporations and companies in and flowing to China as opposed to a much smaller number of corporations trying to break down the door to get into the U.S. and build plants. Where is the comparison of new plants builds in the U.S. and China? Why aren&#8217;t U.S. economists talking about that?</p>
<p>Yes, automobile plants are being built in the U.S. by foreign corporations and that certainly involves a large share of FDI investment in the U.S. But note that the automobile plants fall under a separate trade &#8220;agreement&#8221; not being applied to all other production goods. Instead of duplicating the automobile import agreement, the vast majority of other manufactured goods fall under the general accords of WTO and U.S. trade agreements that have resulted in the significant transference of production offshore from the U.S. as well as the large U.S. trade deficits.</p>
<p>Why are corporate profits high? Look at our trade agreements and the WTO.</p>
<p>In short, we are watching America being gutted as corporate profits soar.</p>

                                <p>A reader who wishes to remain anonymous sent me a list of failures by the GW administration.  I won&#8217;t reproduce the list, but rather some of the message that accompanied it:</p>
<blockquote><p>In looking at the list I think one clear common thread to his policy initiatives is the attempt to privatize government functions.  The social security debate was the most obvious example, but one sees the same trend in his appointments of business leaders to regulate their own industries, his letting of enormous contracts with huge private companies in Iraq, to the structure of his Medicare D policy, to a tax system which skews benefits to the top 10%, and particularly the top one half of one percent.  Perhaps the issue is too polemical for your site, but is it not fair to query whether the private sector can actually compete with well-trained, experienced bureaucrats with a sense of the common good?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Water Solvable?</p>
<p>I want to discuss the political issue of water in a non-partisanand non-religious way.  I am not an economist and only have sole proprietary business experience. I want to avoid Dem/Repub issues so I have included examples of &#8216;liberal&#8217; actions by one of my own.  I also could be labeled a slightly left of center person, although I am also personally surprised at being called just sort of right of socialist.  I think of myself as atheist in this sense of economics, since I know I do neither believe in the invisible hand nor the inherent inefficiency of government.  I do believe that human interests and belief drive market behavior and performance.   I have chosen to go from local arenas to N. and S. America in this post, and have taken a position of strong caution.</p>
<p>As reported in the <a href="http://www.alternet.org/envirohealth/50994/">documentary Thirst</a>, Snitow calls the under funding of public water systems and public infrastructure as a whole, &#8220;systematic&#8221; under the Bush administration:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On water, President Bush says he wants to fund private companies to do it. He does not want to give money, even loan money, to government agencies at the local level to improve their own water systems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But this issue is not a partisan problem. As reported in &#8220;Thirst,&#8221; in 1997 the Clinton administration changed the law to the benefit of private companies. Previously municipal utility contracts were limited to five years, but Clinton changed it to allow contracts to be extended up to 20 years. &#8220;The rule change unleashed a wave of industry euphoria with predictions that private companies would soon be running much of what is now a public service,&#8221; they wrote. In the following five years, municipal water contracts with private companies tripled.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1793an">Lee, MA</a>,   fought this battle backed by a liberal Senator, so to speak, with a water company from Houston.  The <a href="http://www.itt.com/waterbook/Boston.asp">Boston</a>  area copes in a different way.</p>
<p>The South and North American continent are being looked at another way. To limit this post to this area might be useful at first, and a second post on world wide data on another might be useful, in that most of us have first hand knowledge of our own systems&#8230; There&#8217;s more information <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/070417_ap_gw_water.html">here</a>  and <a href="http://www.ledevoir.com/2007/04/25/140832.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/042607G.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to me the intense capitalization needed to renew water systems is a stumbling block, and that to date neither local government nor private companies have the nerve to invest the money needed.  If true, then the profit motive, to me, might create huge problems in delivering safe water for drinking for regular people as opposed to mega-deals, which seem to represent a different sort of market altogether.  Accountability and integrity at a local level means at least I can throw bricks through my selectman or water owner’s windows.  I trust big corporations to have little interest in long-term difficulties of water as a commodity, and examination of performance to date is not encouraging. <br />This is in addition to ‘externalities’ such as <a href="http://news.aol.com/partners/usa-today/_a/ebola-like-virus-kills-fish-in-great/20070430091909990002?ncid=NWS00010000000001">this sort</a>  of problem. How this plays out in agriculture is probably different to some degree, but food is a different sort of problem.</p>

<p>During what I thought was a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/krugman-doesnt-get-he-will-never-get-it.html">regretable attack on Paul Krugman</a>, a few AB readers pointed our attention to a story from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_17/b4031048.htm">Michael Mandel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When is a slowdown not a slowdown? On the face of it, the government&#8217;s statistics tell a very convincing story about cautious companies and weak business investment … There&#8217;s only one problem. Corporate America is still spending big time, just increasingly outside the U.S. A BusinessWeek analysis of financial reports from more than 1,000 large and midsize U.S.-based companies shows that global capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2006 were actually up 18.1% over the previous year, a number that includes nonresidential construction as well as info-tech equipment and machinery. The comparable growth for domestic business investment, which is all the government reports each quarter: only 8.9%, without adjusting for inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few things to note.  Mandel is not talking U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (USDIA) in total, not just in China.  Also note – he does not mention Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  But we can turn to the Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting on our <a href="http://www.bea.gov/international/#IIP">International Investment Position</a>, which reports USDIA and FDI annually through 2005.  We have provided two graphs (all figures in millions $).  The first shows USDIA in China.  From 2004 to 2005, this figure rose from $15 billion to $16.9 billion.  So Stormy’s claim that he has explained away Paul Krugman’s <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/opinion/30krugman.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1&#038;OP=7d3ffb4fQ2FQ22VclQ22ImwQ20Q20IQ22Q3AQ7CQ7CEQ22Q7CZQ22iQ7CQ22Q20hQ2AQ5EQ2AQ20Q5EQ22iQ7C_wonabQ5EQ2B6IaH">puzzle</a> does not cut it.  But what about Mandel’s claim?  It seems Paul Krugman <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://krugman.page.nytimes.com/b/a/258224.htm">addressed this claim</a> as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve A., New York: What do you see as the impact of global capital flows on U.S. investment? While U.S. companies are booking record profits, how much of their investment is being made in the U.S. vs. overseas?</p>
<p>Paul Krugman: A number of people have asked me this question. The short answer is that diversion of investment abroad doesn&#8217;t seem to be the big story. Overall, money actually flowed into the United States last year, on a massive scale, although a lot of that was the Chinese government buying bonds. In terms of &#8220;direct foreign investment&#8221;, basically investment by corporations, $249 billion went out, but $183 billion came in, so the overall effect was only about $85 billion. I know, $85 billion here, $85 billion there, and soon you&#8217;re talking about real money, but it wasn&#8217;t the main factor in low investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our second graph shows USDIA and FDI from 1990 to 2005, which does not include the 2006 data that Dr. Krugman refers to.  Mandel’s argument might have been a good one for the 2001 to 2004 period.  But notice something.  For both 2000 and 2005 FDI grew more than USDIA.  In fact, the increase in USDIA for 2005 was less than $19 billion.</p>

                                <p>Last week I had a few posts on the conservative position on free markets.  I thought the position had some real inconsistencies.  I admit I hadn&#8217;t thought through the best way to state my objections, and the discussion seems to have continued on at Bill Polley&#8217;s place where I wrote <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/04/where_are_the_f_1.html#comments">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the private sector is more efficient than the public sector, and I think we all could agree that most US laws and regulations are not relevant to EBay and the business of its buyers and sellers, why wouldn&#8217;t it make sense for an EBay to come around that was not subject to those laws, and in fact, set its own rules. Those rules would be only those parts of the law that would be beneficial to EBay and its users.</p>
<p>I assume a true conservative would feel that EBay can do a better job of determining what such rules would look like than the US government and would produce something better suited to its needs and the needs of its customers than the hodge podge that is the current body of US law. (We&#8217;re not talking about something excessively complex. A few good attorneys and a legal budget of $10K ought to do it. Even if I&#8217;m off by two orders of magnitude, we&#8217;re talking peanuts to EBay.)</p>
<p>Given how easy and inexpensive it would be to reach this happy state of somewhat less regulation, where the amount of &#8220;less&#8221; is defined by EBay and/or its users, one can only wonder why nobody is doing it. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/04/free_markets_an.html">Bill&#8217;s response</a> is that institutions matter.  EBay is willing to put up with US regulations because they get US institutions as part of the bargain.  I agree with this, of course.</p>
<p>But I still have a few questions about the conservative position:</p>
<p>Are the institutions and the regulations separable?  If not, then it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to say one is for less regulation but for stronger institutions.  If yes, well, it should be possible to create those institutions elsewhere.</p>
