                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/05/the_taxcut_myth.html">John Stossel</a> has a weird discussion, which starts off OK:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government keeps growing, as I pointed out last week, but the Bush administration has cut tax rates a few times since 2001. How can that be? The answer is simple: deficit spending.Some Republicans argue that deficits don&#8217;t matter; that if you cut taxes, everything else takes care of itself. But that&#8217;s a myth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then he launches into the free lunch myth of the Laffer curve.  This is followed by what appears to be a return to reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>there&#8217;s a downside to cutting tax rates without cutting spending. Deficit spending disguises the real burden of government. As a result, we get more than we&#8217;d want &#8212; and that&#8217;s not good. Government makes up the deficit either by borrowing, which removes productive resources from private hands and must be repaid by future taxes, or by creating money out of thin air &#8211; inflation &#8211; which steals purchasing power from us by devaluing our money. In other words, tax cuts without spending cuts are an illusion. The burden of government has not really been lightened. As the late Milton Friedman constantly pointed out, that burden is better measured by the level of spending, not the level of taxes. Shame on the Bush administration for trying to pull a fast one on the American public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice!  Even better, he follows this by correctly noting that the falling unified deficit is due to the increase in Trust Fund surpluses.  So this was not fit for the National Review.  But maybe he felt bad for joining the Reality Based Community, which is why he had to write this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s give President Bush some credit for the falling deficit. Because of his tax cuts, tax revenue &#8211; our hard-earned money &#8211; is pouring into the government&#8217;s coffers, Government spending is keeping ahead of that torrent, but at an ever-slower rate. Hence the shrinking deficit. But this is not necessarily a good thing.  Bush boasted last year, &#8220;This economy is growing, federal taxes are rising, and we&#8217;re cutting the federal deficit faster than we expected. Some in Washington say we had to choose between cutting taxes and cutting the deficit. Today&#8217;s numbers show that that was a false choice. The economic growth fueled by tax relief has helped send our tax revenues soaring.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t want tax revenues to soar.</p></blockquote>
<p>This kind of Laffer lunacy set <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/05/john_stossel_sh.html">Mark Thoma</a> off.  Mark has some real choice words for John.  But if John takes this Laffer Curve stuff seriously and he wants less tax revenues, wouldn’t his policy prescription be an increase in tax rates?  But let’s be fair.  Stossel is hopelessly confused here – which is the kind of stupid nonsense we see from the National Review on a routine basis.</p>

                                <p>A word about blogs that provide summaries of posts on other blogs.</p>
<p>1.  Steve Benen of the Carpetbagger does the <a href="http://blogreport.salon.com/default.aspx">Blog Report</a> for Salon.  (Angry Bear has been featured a few times.)  It provides a glimpse into what blogs from the left and the right have to say on any given day.</p>
<p>2.  For some reason, I managed to forget about the <a href="http://www.rtable.net/index/rt/economics/recent/">Economics Roundtable</a> for a long time, and have only recently rediscovered it.  Its run by Professor William R. Parke of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and it produces blurbs (the first few sentences) from posts on 135 different economics blogs.  Its a good way to see what&#8217;s being said out there, and if you like the blurb, you can jump to the blog itself.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had a post the other day summarizing findings from a bunch of other posts I had previously written looking at<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">changes in a number of series over various Presidential administrations</a> beginning with Ike. The striking thing is that in general things (economic growth, abortions, drug use, dollar valuation, etc.) tend to go much better when Democrats are in office than when Republicans are in office.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on? Well, maybe one place to start is with things that have been consistently different between Republicans and Democrats over that period of time.</p>
<p>1. Republicans are more inclined to say they think the government should be smaller (whether they actually shrink the government or not is a different story) and even view the government as the enemy. With that attitude, Republicans are likely to put less effort into thinking of ways they can use the government to benefit the economy.</p>
<p>2. Another consistent difference is that Republicans have consistently claimed to be the pro-business party. In practice, that has generally meant a more laissez-faire attitude toward business. The idea is: let business do its thing and it will improve the economy. But in the real world of the profit motive, the easiest way to improve one&#8217;s profits is often to export some of one&#8217;s costs onto others. (i.e., impose externalities on third parties) Some increases in output may come at the expense of much, much greater costs upon society, leading to a net reduction in the economy. (Examples may include pollution from manufacturing, cost avoidance by health insurance companies, etc.) Even with the exact same laws and regulations on the books, the President can push the emphasis on enforcement toward one or another direction. (Anyone who doubts that hasn&#8217;t been paying attention to the Justice Department in the past few years.)</p>
<p>3. Republicans have typically billed themselves as the party of law and order. In practice,the ratio of enforcement of concern over blue collar crime to concern over white collar crime goes up under Republicans and down under Democrats. But blue collar crime is more likely to be a crime of necessity. When it is believed that people get more time for robbing $50 than for looting a pension fund, respect for society diminishes. </p>
<p>4. Republican economic plans have typically taken the form of &#8220;what&#8217;s good for General Motors is good for the country.&#8221; Put another way&#8230; make things easy on the folks at the top, and eventually everyone benefits. Democratic economic plans have typically taken the opposite approach, whether one considers LBJ&#8217;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221; or Clinton&#8217;s attempt to reform healthcare. Perhaps the easiest way to raise all boats is to raise them directly, not with a warm stream of suspicious provenance trickling down from above.</p>
<p>5. Republicans are less likely to think much of the safety net. But as an entrepreneur myself, though not (yet) a successful one, I can tell you that the lack of a safety net makes me less likely to go out and try again. And it makes me less likely to continue operating as an independent contractor. I&#8217;m not worried about OSHA regulations or even a 5% increase in my taxes. I am scared to death that insurance costs will continue to rise at the rate its been rising and that I may not be able to eat if business dries up for a few months. From my own personal perspective, Republican policies are less conducive to entrepreneurship than Democratic policies.</p>
<p>6. Republicans are the party of lower taxes. But, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society. They pay for roads and public health and keeping the Canadian hordes at bay &#8211; things that allow businesses to function and improve the economy. They also mean less government borrowing, which means less debt, which means less interest on the debt.</p>
<p>Your thoughts? Agree or disagree? Have I missed anything that might explain some of the difference in performance?</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll just cut to the chase: we suck. Despite the fact that we see doctors less often, go to the hospital less often, and stay in the hospital for shorter times than any of the other countries in the report, we still spend by far the most money. In return for this we get lousier care.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, is there anyone out there that doubts this?  Regardless of the reasons for it, is there anyone out there that doubts that we pay more and get poorer (or charitably, comparable) service to folks in other countries?</p>
<p>The reason typically given&#8230; other countries are free-riding on the drug research paid for by Americans &#8211; that might go some way toward explaining higher costs for pharmaceuticals, but for hospital visits?</p>

<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s all sorts of things you could work out from this quick study. One is the illusion that the Republicans are the party of rich people and the Democrats are the party of the poor. Another is the possibility that Democrat states are more likely to enrich their people than Republican ones, and if that is true, then perhaps there is something to be said for increasing spending on welfare.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After a frustrating search for a new &#8220;war czar&#8221; to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, ABC News has learned that President Bush has chosen the Pentagon&#8217;s director of operations, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, for the role. </p>
<p>In the newly created position of assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan policy and implementation, Lute would have the power to direct the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies involved in the two conflicts. </p>
<p>Lute would report directly to the president and to National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. </p>
<p>Filling the position had become a priority for the White House, after a handful of retired generals told the White House they did not want the job. Among them, retired Marine Corps four-star Gen. Jack Sheehan, who proved an embarrassment to the White House after he wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington Post saying there were &#8220;huge shortcomings&#8221; in the White House view of the strategy in Iraq. </p></blockquote>
<p>Not content to leave well enough alone, <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_05_13_archive.html#9038632410903863931">Atrios locates something Lute said</a>.  From an article in the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9f81fef2-14de-11da-9df1-00000e2511c8.html">Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US is expected to pull significant numbers of troops out of Iraq in the next 12 months in spite of the continuing violence, according to the general responsible for near-term planning in the country.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Douglas Lute, director of operations at US Central Command, yesterday said the reductions were part of a push by Gen John Abizaid, commander of all US troops in the region, to put the burden of defending Iraq on Iraqi forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>He said: “We believe at some point, in order to break this dependence on the . . . coalition, you simply have to back off and let the Iraqis step forward.</p>
<p>“You have to undercut the perception of occupation in Iraq. It&#8217;s very difficult to do that when you have 150,000-plus, largely western, foreign troops occupying the country.”</p>
<p>While he cautioned that any troop reduction would be conditional on continued political progress and ongoing improvement in Iraqi force training, he said Centcom planners believed “the political process will play out, that we will see a constitution, that we will see, by some political machinations, the Sunnis brought into the process and we will proceed to national elections in December”.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that was in 2005.  I remember when the goal was to get the Iraqis to be less dependent.  I remember being told how it was working and that anyone doubting was an America-hater.</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan sends a link to <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/12/1136/">testimony by Jeremy Scahill</a> before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.  Scahill, a reporter for the left wing magazine <em>The Nation</em>, was testifying &#8220;on the impact of private military contractors on the conduct of the Iraq War.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>As this Committee is well aware, we are now in the midst of the most privatized war in the history of our country. This is hardly a new phenomenon, but it is one that has greatly accelerated since the launch of the “global war on terror” and the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Many Americans are under the impression that the US currently has about 145,000 active duty troops on the ground in Iraq. What is seldom mentioned is the fact that there are at least 126,000 private personnel deployed alongside the official armed forces. These private forces effectively double the size of the occupation force, largely without the knowledge of the US taxpayers that foot the bill.</p>
<p>But despite the similarity in size of these respective forces in Iraq, there are key differences with the way our government approaches the active-duty military and these private war contractors. For instance, we know that nearly 3,400 US soldiers have been killed in Iraq and more than 25,000 wounded. We do not know the exact number of private contractors killed or wounded. Through the US Department of Labor, we have been able to determine that at least 770 contractors had been killed in Iraq as of December 2006 along with at least 7,700 wounded. These casualties are not included in the official death count and help to mask the human costs of the war. More disturbing is what this means for our democracy: at a time when the administration seems unwilling to subject its war strategy to oversight by the Congress, we face the widespread use of private forces seemingly accountable to no effective system of oversight or law.</p>
<p>While tens of thousands of these contractors provide logistical support, thousands are heavily armed private soldiers roaming Iraq. We do know that there are some 48,000 employees of private military companies in Iraq alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>There is slang in Iraq now for this jump. It is called “Going Blackwater.” To put it bluntly, these private forces create a system where national duty is outbid by profits. And yet these forces are being used for mission-critical activities. Indeed, in January Gen. David Petraeus admitted that on his last tour in Iraq, he himself was protected not by the active-duty military but by private “contract security.”</p>
<p>Just as there is a double standard in pay, there is a double standard in the application of the law. Soldiers who commit crimes or acts of misconduct are prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. There have been some 64 courts martial on murder-related charges in Iraq alone. Compare that to the lack of prosecution of contractors. Despite the fact that tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, have streamed in and out of Iraq since March of 2003, only two private contractors have faced any criminal prosecution. Two. One was a KBR employee alleged to have stabbed a co-worker, the other pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography images on his computer at Abu Ghraib prison. In four years, there have been no prosecutions for crimes against Iraqis and not a single known prosecution of an armed contractor.</p>
<p>That either means we have tens of thousands of Boy Scouts working as armed contractors or something is fundamentally wrong with the system. Brig. Gen. Karl Horst of the 3rd Infantry Division became so outraged by contractor unaccountability that he began tracking contractor violence in Baghdad. In just two months he documented twelve cases of contractors shooting at civilians, resulting in six deaths and three injuries. That is just two months and one general.</p>
<p>They have not been prosecuted under the UCMJ, under US civilian law or under Iraqi law. US contractors in Iraq reportedly have their own motto: “What happens here today, stays here today.” That should be chilling to everyone who believes that warfare, above all government functions, must be subject to transparency, accountability and the rule of law.</p>
<p>These are forces operating in the name of the United States of America. Iraqis do not see contractors as separate from soldiers–understandably, they see them all as “the occupation.” Contractor misconduct is viewed as American misconduct.</p></blockquote>

<p>cactus notes:  Yes, the guy is from a lefty publication, but does any of this sound, well, wrong?  Does it sound exagerated?  </p>
<p>Dan sends a few questions:</p>
<p>This huge experiment in privatization of armed forces has not been done with US forces before. It appears to have many intended and unintended consequences. Care to parse the dozens of ideas that come to mind?</p>
<p>1.  Incentives for performance appears to be contradictory in nature and to divide loyalties because ratio of soldier to contractor is almost 1:1. How would this look to AB military experienced readers? <br />2.  Lack of oversight by the Pentagon staggers the imagination. <br />3.  The links to private companies appears to be more than suppliers of equipment and such. Does using private food contractors actually free up soldiers to fight? Or do other things happen that can be posited?  </p>
<p>cactus again&#8230; I add one comment.  Remember the letter Petraeus wrote the troops?  About how soldiers need to behave in such a way to win over the hearts and minds?  Does anyone think its happening?  Does anyone think the lack of accountability of contractors has nothing to do with the losing of Iraqi hearts and minds?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070515/could_we_afford_a_president_ed.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> starts off with a decent summary of the fiscal proposals from John Edwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ve got to give John Edwards some credit. Unlike most of the presidential candidates of both parties, he&#8217;s actually proposing some very specific economic policies&#8211;and even putting some price tags on them. (Hint to GOP candidates debating tonight in South Carolina.) Universal healthcare? Somewhere between $90 billion and $120 billion a year. Then there&#8217;s his $20 billion spending program to end poverty. And his $13 billion spending program to revamp American energy use. So where&#8217;s all the money coming from to pay for all this wonderful stuff?</p></blockquote>
<p>Edwards has had the courage to say he’d raise taxes but Pethokoukis suggests that the recommended tax increases might not be enough to pay for this extra spending.  Even though I’m support Mr. Edwards, I should say – good point.  But then Pethokoukis had to write this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the pace of tax revenues, Uncle Sam might have a balanced budget sooner rather than later. Economist Michael Darda notes that if tax revenue growth continues to outpace spending growth by 6.1 percentage points, the budget will move into surplus by April 2008. It will be hard for fiscal hawks to argue the budget is in crisis when it&#8217;s in the black. Score a point for Edwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>No – score this a case where Pethokoukis got suckered by Darda.  If taxes continue to grow by 6.1%?  Please.  Besides, they are talking about the unified deficit which has improved mainly because the Trust Fund surpluses are growing.  The General Fund deficit is still quite large.  OK, the GOP candidates will feed the public these free lunch lies based on this kind of garbage accounting – but this deficit hawk Democrat wants candidates to be more honest.  Shame on Michael Darda and shame on James Pethokoukis.</p>

<blockquote><p>John Guido, dealer principal of Arlington Heights Ford, thinks his sales have suffered from a combination of rising car prices and longer loans, leaving fewer buyers in a position to trade for a new vehicle when the new-car itch typically appears after a few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;They used to be able to trade after three years. Now it&#8217;s four years,&#8221; Guido said. &#8220;If they owe $16,000 on a car that&#8217;s worth $12,000, they can&#8217;t get to a payment they&#8217;re comfortable with. That could mean a $100 swing&#8221; in their monthly payment.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite a record U.S. population and more licensed drivers than ever, sales of new vehicles slipped nearly 3 percent last year to their lowest level since 1998 and are down the same amount this year.</p>
<p>Analysts and auto manufacturers cite several factors for the sales slide, including high gas prices, sagging home values and sluggish economic growth.</p>
<p>But those who study car-buying habits see another factor keeping a lid on car sales: the aggressive borrowing habits of consumers today.</p>
<p>They say borrowers have stretched out their car loans over such a long period of time that some can no longer afford to replace their vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would like to trade, but they can&#8217;t. They have no equity,&#8221; said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, which studies consumer buying trends.</p>
<p>Three out of five new-vehicle loans made this year, or 60 percent, are for 61 months or longer, and nearly 20 percent are for longer than six years, according to a Consumer Bankers Association study. Some go as long as 96 months.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a dramatic increase since 2000, when just 21 percent of loans were for longer than five years. A longer loan takes more time to build equity usable for the down payment on the next vehicle, thus causing some buyers to delay a purchase.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117909372050801357-9CN_zEDzfJJ38kBXQa0viF2VBm8_20070520.html?mod=regionallinks">Bob Davis</a> of the Wall Street Journal explores why a rise in the price of one’s exports might become a problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>With copper prices soaring, Chile is flush with cash. That may not sound like a problem, but for a commodity-rich country, it can be a big one.  Resource wealth has brought unstable nations in the Middle East and Africa to their knees by spawning war or corruption. Even wealthy nations have a tough time handling commodity booms, which can drive up their currencies, batter their exporters and produce unsustainable surges in imports. In a case much studied by economists, the Dutch economy stagnated after rich natural-gas deposits were discovered offshore in the 1960s. These days, Venezuela and other oil producers riding oil-backed consumption booms are vulnerable to &#8220;Dutch disease,&#8221; especially if oil prices decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max Corden and Peter Neary’s 1982 publication &#8211; <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0133%28198212%2992%3A368%3C825%3ABSADIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L&#038;size=LARGE&#038;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage">Booming Sector and De-Industrialisation in a Small Open Economy</a> is often cited in reference to this so-called Dutch disease.  It would seem Chile’s fiscal policy is addressing the implications of this revenue boom in a sensible way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chile is trying to inoculate itself. In essence, the government is saving what it calculates as windfall profits from its state-owned copper company and windfall taxes from privately owned mines. It is investing the money abroad in bonds and is also considering buying foreign stock funds. The idea is that when Chile&#8217;s economy inevitably falters, the government can tap this &#8220;economic and social stabilization fund&#8221; for revenue. &#8220;The question that plagues Latin America and other emerging markets is: How do you avoid the booms and busts from commodity cycles?&#8221; says Chile&#8217;s finance minister, Andrés Velasco. &#8220;In Chile we have a simple answer: spend that which is permanent and save that which is transitory.&#8221; So far, Chile has set aside about $6 billion for the stabilization fund and expects to add another $6 billion or so by the end of the year. The sum would be equivalent to about 10% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services it produces in a year. That&#8217;s an enormous political accomplishment. Try to imagine the U.S. government putting aside $1 trillion &#8211; about 10% of the U.S. economy&#8217;s annual output &#8211; in a rainy-day fund invested in foreign stocks and bonds. That would be nearly impossible, given congressional pressures to increase spending or cut taxes.  In 1990, oil-rich Norway started a stabilization fund, which now has a portfolio of around $300 billion, a startling sum for a nation of 4.6 million. Chile copied Norway&#8217;s approach, but its fund didn&#8217;t begin to pile up assets until the past few years, as the price of copper soared to more than $3 a pound, triple its 2004 level. Banking part of that windfall requires far greater sacrifice by Chile, where the per-capita income in 2005 was $7,100, about one-seventh of Norway&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
<p>I happened to enjoy how Mr. Davis imagined “the U.S. government putting aside $1 trillion &#8211; about 10% of the U.S. economy&#8217;s annual output &#8211; in a rainy-day fund invested in foreign stocks and bonds.”  If only!</p>
