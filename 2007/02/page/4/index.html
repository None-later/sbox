                                <p>Via Steve Benen, <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10003.html">the scariest thing I&#8217;ve heard about Iraq so far</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maj. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, commander of the Oklahoma National Guard, told the NYT that one-third of his soldiers lacked the M-4 rifles preferred by active-duty soldiers and that there were also shortfalls in night vision goggles and other equipment. Capt. Christopher Heathscott, a spokesman for the Arkansas National Guard, said the state’s 39th Brigade Combat Team was 600 rifles short for its 3,500 soldiers and also lacked its full arsenal of mortars and howitzers.</p>
<p>Think about that — National Guard troops are training for another quick deployment, but some of these soldiers don’t even have the right rifles yet. Body armor and Humvee protection is one thing, but Guard troops don’t have the rifles they want?</p></blockquote>
<p>Two comments:<br />1. Bear in mind&#8230; these are National Guard troops&#8230; not regular military. Most of these folks would never have imagined they were going to be deployed abroad when they signed up. Who knows how many of them have been stop-lossed. Now, what? They&#8217;re supposed to throw rocks at the insurgents?<br />2. This kind of shortage didn&#8217;t just develop. Regardless of blame shifting, we&#8217;ve had a Republican Congress and a Republican administration for six years. Someone should be accountable for this mess.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Earlier this week I had a post looking at changes in the nominal money supply per capita.  I thought the changes hinted at the Fed behaving in ways intended to influence elections.  Others saw only coincidences. </p>
<p>So…  I worked on the data some more.  I adjusted for changes in population and inflation.  And I created a table (near the bottom of this post) that shows the 3 month change in real M2 per capita – that is, the change in M2 money over and above (or under and below) the rate of change of inflation per person.  </p>
<p>Before we look at the table, I’d like to tell you what I expected.  I figured the Fed does try to influence elections.  I would imagine it is more likely to favor incumbents (first, the incumbent is more likely to have appointed or re-appointed the Fed chair, and in 6 out of the 8 observations in the sample in which an incumbent has stood for re-election, the Fed chair came from the same party as the sitting incumbent).  </p>
<p>The way to influence an election is simple… increase the Money Supply in an unusual way (say, more than normal for that month of the year) in the months leading up to an election, making the public feel a bit more prosperous than they otherwise would.  However, to avoid inflation, in the months following an election, the Fed would have smaller increases in the Money Supply than usual for that month of the year.  </p>
<p>The table below shows the 3 month percent change in M2 up to each month of the calendar year.  Results are shown for all years, years preceding a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent, years in which there is a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent, and years after a Presidential election in which there is an incumbent.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rd22moVHjyI/AAAAAAAAAFM/MsQlFjuQNiA/s1600-h/Fed+Independence,+Table+1,+Second+pass.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rd22moVHjyI/AAAAAAAAAFM/MsQlFjuQNiA/s320/Fed+Independence,+Table+1,+Second+pass.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This seems to indicate that:</p>
<p>1.  The three month percentage change in real M2 per capita through September, October, and November seem to be unusually large in years in which an incumbent President is running for re-election<br />2.  The three month percentage change in real M2 per capita ending in December and January following an election in which an incumbent President is running for re-election are unusually low<br />3.  What I cannot explain – I didn’t make a prediction either way, but results strike me as a bit odd – is the fact that in the year before a presidential election in which an incumbent is running for re-election, changes in real M2 per capita are unusually high in many of the early months of the year.  Pure speculation….  It may be related to congressional elections… while most Presidents running for re-election were Republican, most Congresses running for re-election during the same period were Democrat.  Anyone else have a guess?</p>
<p>But, items 1 and 2 seem to indicate… the pattern of changes in the real money in the month of a Presidential election in which a sitting President is running for re-election, in the two months previous to that, and in the two months following that, just happen, by shear coincidence, to be precisely those one would expect if the Fed was trying to influence the election. </p>

<p>As always, let me know if you want my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re interested in where I’m going, here’s my thought process.  I intend to examine this a bit further… I want to break out whether there’s a difference (as I expect there to be) between situations in which the incumbent and the Fed chairman come from the same party as opposed to different parties.  I also want to see what happens when the Fed chairman is a Republican as opposed to a Democrat.  There may be one or two more things to look at… then I want to get back to where I started last week, namely looking at the relationship between changes in the real money supply per capita and growth rates in the economy.</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.  corrected first sentence &#8211; error pointed out by reader Bobby Corcoran.</p>
<p>Update 2&#8230;  Reader Don Lloyd suggested that the Fed might think more in terms of nominal, non-per capita money.  The table below shows the changes in the nominal money supply, by month, in and around years in which an incumbent President sits for re-election.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m attending a bris today. (If you don&#8217;t know what it is, don&#8217;t look it up. If you insist on looking it up, don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.) Assuming I&#8217;m well enough&#8230; I&#8217;m feeling kind of under the weather. The kid&#8217;s parents are very close friends of mine, and now of the ex-Girlfriend as well. They&#8217;re not at all religious.</p>
<p>When they got married, they had a recognizably Jewish ceremony. So did the ex-Girlfriend and I, though we&#8217;re not religious either. This phenomenon is not limited to Jews. I have close friends that are Catholic and various shades of Protestant that are not religious, and those that have been married have done so in ceremonies that are recognizably of the faith they are, um, nominally members of. One friend of mine who is Catholic goes to mass almost every Sunday, but its fairly obvious he doesn&#8217;t believe in God at all.</p>
<p>So why do people participate in these ceremonies in which they don&#8217;t believe?</p>
<p>I can think of several reasons for this:<br />1. Family pressures. <br />2. Social networking.<br />3. Bet hedging. (Pascal&#8217;s wager)<br />4. All of us really do believe.<br />5. We place some value on tradition or history.</p>
<p>I personally would answer #5. What else is there? What am I missing?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/income_inequali.html">Mark Thoma</a> is providing us with thorough coverage of the good, the bad, and the ugly on this debate on whether income inequality is increasing.  I cannot do justice to all of what Mark links to, but I have a reason to focus on what <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/02/16/dirk-krueger-fabrizio-perri/inequality-in-what">Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri</a> said:<br />
<blockquote>Measuring inequality in lifetime consumption and leisure is an impossible task as it would require data on consumption for many households, each followed for a very long period of time. Such data unfortunately do not exist. What is then a feasible and appropriate way of measuring inequality in lifetime consumption? If people would earn constant income throughout their lives, current income would be a very good approximation of lifetime consumption. In the data, though, current income fluctuates substantially over the life cycle and thus it is a potentially poor indicator of lifetime resources. Fortunately, we can use simple theories of consumption decisions of households over time (pioneered by Nobel prize winners Milton Friedman and Franco Modigliani), which show that if households can borrow and lend on financial markets, then there is a strong link between the lifetime resources of a household (sometimes also called its permanent income) and its current consumption. Current income shocks that are not fully permanent (such as seasonal shocks, job losses, bonus payments) strongly affect current income (and thus have a strong impact on the distribution of current income), but only have a moderate impact on permanent income and thus consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I realize that measured consumption inequality has not increased as much as measured income inequality.  And I’m sort of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">on record</a> for suggesting lifetime income inequality has indeed increased.  AB readers will note that I did discuss a research paper by Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri as well as a related paper by Matteo Iacoviello.  AB readers might also recall that that I often appeal to the logic of this Ando-Modigliani model.  So how do I reconcile my respect for this Ando-Modigliani model and my view that income inequality has indeed increased. First of all, Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri note several caveats about using their proxy for lifetime income inequality.  Secondly, consider what I wrote way back then:<br />
<blockquote>Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally. Examining the distribution of current consumption misses the point that living standards should be gauged across individual’s lifetimes. While the very wealthy have ample resources for old age retirement, the evidence suggests that the working poor may not – unless we retain the Social Security Trust Fund as a vehicle to supplement their retirement benefits. Rightwingers like John Hood, however, are advocating that the government substantially reduce Social Security benefits. Go figure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the rise in wealth inequality over time is a statistic that is not consistent with this lifecycle model explanation of why income inequality has grown by much more than consumption inequality has grown.</p>

                                <p>It seems that any debate about the war in Iraq is treason in some quarters.  Via Steve Benen, a look at how <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9985.html">Republicans looked at other wars</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What’s more, this phenomenon isn’t limited to 1995 and Bosnia.</p>
<p>When Republicans didn’t like the conflict in Somalia in 1993, the congressional GOP decided Congress had all kinds of authority to intervene, whether the president liked it or not. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for example, on Oct. 19, 1993, argued that Congress had the power to force Clinton to begin an “immediate, orderly withdrawal from Somalia.” He added, “[I]f we do not do that and other Americans die, other Americans are wounded, other Americans are captured because we stay too long — longer than necessary — then I would say that the responsibilities for that lie with the Congress of the United States who did not exercise their authority under the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p>Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) said Congress should “force the administration to find a way out of the quagmire.” Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho) said it was up to the Senate “to get the American troops home.” Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) said, “It is time to retreat now…. It is time to leave and for this body, it is time to debate this issue.” Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) said, “I cannot continue to support … the continuing endangerment of Americans in the service of a policy that remains absolutely mysterious and totally muddled.”&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Today the LA Times has a story on a recent court ruling that </p>
<p>In a victory for the White House, a U.S. appeals court Tuesday threw out the legal claims brought on behalf of the hundreds of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay and ruled that they did not have a right to plead their innocence in an American court.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-na-gitmo21feb21,1,4762504.story">threw out legal claims of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay</a>. The story notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>In a 2-1 decision, the judges said the Constitution did not extend the right of habeas corpus to noncitizens held outside the sovereign territory of this country. &#8220;Cuba — not the United States — has sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay,&#8221; Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us say this goes to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court rules the same way based on the same reasoning. (I understand its not an unreasonable assumption.) Here are is a question for our readers who are attorneys or otherwise have a good understanding of the law:</p>
<p>What happens when Cuba decides to exercise this sovereignty given to them by the US Courts? I understand Guantanamo has been a thorn in the Cuban side since Castro overthrew Batista. (i.e., since one SOB overthrew another SOB)</p>
<p>As a follow-up, if Scalia and Thomas and Alito and Roberts and one more of the, um, towering legal minds on the Court decide that Cuban sovereignty only applies when it benefits the administration, and not when the Cubans decide to exercise it, what happens to the American concept of property rights?</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>In a past posting, I presented some graphs that suggested to me that we have changed the way we make money. Our focus has changed from the Adam Smith focus on labor to a focus on capital. I think it is important that we understand this change in order to make better choices at the polls. Even the data analysis Cactus has been producing, suggesting there is a party selective results to our overall economy, there has been the signs of the switch to a focus on money. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/spencers-comment-on-relative.html"> Spencer&#8217;s chart of Real Non-residential Fixed Investment </a> further supports that a change was made. The best performing curve in his chart is pre 1980&#8217;s. The mighty Clinton years don&#8217;t come close to the pre 1980&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One could argue that things are different with the move to globalization and thus, we should not expect such growth as pre 1980&#8217;s. I disagree. I would interpret our poor performance since the Reagan revolution not to competition but to poor policy/management in the response to the competition. At least in business that is how it would be interpreted. If you are with or behind the rise, then you are not being successful in growing the business.</p>
<p>The first chart is GDP vs Income types. This is a stacked chart. From the top line to the bottom they are: GDP, Profits after tax, Disposable Income, Personal Dividend, Personal Interest, Wages and Salaries. Again, the greatest acceleration is happening after 1981. Note, that income in the form of wages and salary is rising the least. We know that wages and productivity split in 1973. The extra income from the rise in productivity, based on this chart must be in the form of corporate profits, dividend and interest. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGWoVHjwI/AAAAAAAAAEk/M_Un7nhj_gI/s1600-h/DolB1.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGWoVHjwI/AAAAAAAAAEk/M_Un7nhj_gI/s320/DolB1.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The next chart is Distribution of Profits. The lines from top to bottom are: Profits after taxes, Personal Dividends, Personal Interest, Wages and Salaries, Depreciation, Net Non-residential investment. In my first post, I noted there were 3 distinct changes in tax policy based on the graph. The first was the greater increase in depreciation starting after 1981. However, based on this chart, the profit is not solely from that. The next was Net dividends. It&#8217;s rise started in 1987. The third was a near vertical rise in non-distributed corporate profit. One thing is certain in this chart, the income is not going into wages or investment by the companies (at least not in this country). The money is staying in money.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGRYVHjvI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3O9Wtob-1tk/s1600-h/DolB2.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGRYVHjvI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3O9Wtob-1tk/s320/DolB2.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The third chart compares disposable income (income everyone has left over) to income from assets. The top line is asset income the bottom is disposable income. This supports that a greater share of income is from money and not labor.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGN4VHjuI/AAAAAAAAAEU/EqFCfBoLF8Q/s1600-h/DolB3.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGN4VHjuI/AAAAAAAAAEU/EqFCfBoLF8Q/s320/DolB3.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The fourth chart of distribution of asset income shows dividends rising faster again supporting that we are making money from money.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGIYVHjtI/AAAAAAAAAEM/qOqJVuaBiRg/s1600-h/Dolb4.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGIYVHjtI/AAAAAAAAAEM/qOqJVuaBiRg/s320/Dolb4.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The final chart is Wages vs Industry type. The lines from top to bottom are: Service Industries, Distributive Industries, Goods producing Industries, Wages and Salaries. The first thing to notice is that wages and salaries do not rise as fast as any of the industries. It is probably the most important finding to note if we are concerned about the worker. This chart shows that there is no sector of employment that will allow the employee to benefit from the rising economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGD4VHjsI/AAAAAAAAAEE/WTmB2WqHzbM/s1600-h/DolB5.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGD4VHjsI/AAAAAAAAAEE/WTmB2WqHzbM/s320/DolB5.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>When we look at these charts, is it any wonder that our auto industry (as the most exemplary of goods producing) is in trouble? Is it any wonder that labor (those earning money using their bodies or their minds via employment or self employment) is struggling? Is it any wonder that the market keeps going up even though consumer spending is down? The money that is being earned by companies is not going out side the company. They are not investing within this country, they are not paying the help and they are paying less in taxes. What money they are distributing is going to those who own the company or who have loaned the company money.</p>
<p>Finally, if we look at just 2006s income and use the top 1%&#8217;s share from 1976 of 8.86% there would have been $816.47 billion more for the rest of us. Even at 1948&#8217;s % share, there would have been $556.37 more for the rest of us. Imagine how much more federal revenue that would have generated just in income taxes alone. Or how about the stimulus to the economy in consumer spending? Or how about the local taxes that could be paid because the worker could afford it. But, imagine how much better off we would be if the share of income had stayed at 8.86% for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Under democrats the economy does significantly better than under republicans. That is pretty solid. So why? I do not buy the argument that it is long and variable lags. Rather, I think the difference is in the impact of Keynesian policies as compared to supply side policies. Generally, democrats implement Keynesian type policies. This is based on the premise that you use deficits to give consumers extra income and they will go out and spend it. This generates strong corporate profits and strong markets that in turn lead to strong capital spending. Supply side policy, in contrast is based on the premise that you use deficits to give tax cuts to the wealthy, or the investor class, and they will investment their extra income and this will generate capital spending that pulls the economy up.</p>
<p>So both are based on the premise that using deficits to give different groups extra income will lead to greater capital spending and a stronger economy. If you look at the record of what happens to capital spending you see that democratic or Keynesian stimulus is followed by very strong capital spending so this thesis seems to work. In contrast, supply side tax cuts are followed by weak capital spending so at best the supply side argument is unproven.</p>
<p>So why the difference? Look at the source of nonresidential capital spending. Some 82% stems from the corporate side of the economy while only 11% is accounted for by S corporations, partnerships, households, etc.. that are subject to the individual income tax code. The remaining 7% is from nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>Second look at why people or corporations invest. It is because they think they can make a profit by selling the output of the new capacity when it comes on stream not because they have money burning a hole in their pocket. this is clearly what Keynesian type policies assume about human nature why supply side policies assume they invest because they have investable fund. So which one seems more realistic?</p>
<p>Third, look at what has happened to savings. For a quarter of a century we have implemented supply side type policies on the premise that it would lead to greater savings and investments &#8212; in a closed economy they are suppose to be equal. But again, look at the record. The major tax incentives we have implemented to encourage savings has been accompanied by a collapse in personal savings. It has to be the one of the greatest examples of a policy that completely failed that anyone can ever find.</p>
<p>So it seems pretty clear to me that the reason the economy does better under Democrats than under Republicans is that Keynesian policies clearly work while their is little or no evidence that supply side type policies have worked.</p>

                                <p>Jonah Goldberg <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTYwZmFiZGNhY2I0YzMwMDJmOWExYjZiMTc3ZmMyZjA=">links approvingly</a> to &#8220;a pretty powerful op-ed by <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/48926">Alicia Colon</a> in the NY Sun&#8221; and then goes on to provide this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The total military dead in the Iraq war between 2003 and this month stands at about 3,133. This is tragic, as are all deaths due to war, and we are facing a cowardly enemy unlike any other in our past that hides behind innocent citizens. Each death is blazoned in the headlines of newspapers and Internet sites. What is never compared is the number of military deaths during the Clinton administration: 1,245 in 1993; 1,109 in 1994; 1,055 in 1995; 1,008 in 1996. That&#8217;s 4,417 deaths in peacetime but, of course, who&#8217;s counting?</p></blockquote>
<p>But Goldberg expresses some doubt about the numbers.  And when even Goldberg doubts the numbers intended to cast Clinton in a poor light, some serious spinning is going on.  Long time readers might remember I looked <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/military-deaths-and-competence.html">at military deaths</a>.  </p>
<p>The raw data is <a href="http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/Death_Rates1.pdf">here</a>.  You can look at the data and see the trends for yourself, or you can look at something that was pulled out of Alicia&#8217;s colon.</p>
