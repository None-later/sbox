                                <p><a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005080.html">Jane Galt</a> gets full credit (or blame) for the recent debate among <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/02/social_security_31.html">Arnold Kling</a>, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/guilty_as_charg.html">Mark Thoma</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/social-security-kling-tells-thoma-there.html">this Angrybear</a>.  I have two objections to what Jane wrote here:<br />
<blockquote>I find it interesting to note that if you replaced &#8220;social security crisis&#8221; with &#8220;global warming&#8221;, you&#8217;d find that most liberals and conservatives had neatly switched positions. Why? Because addressing each crisis requires cutting into something that one side values; free enterprise, on the one hand, and the progressive structure of social security, on the other.  Easy for me to say, of course; I&#8217;m one of those rare cats who thinks that we should do something sooner rather than later about both global warming and social security, so it&#8217;s fun for me to sit on the sidelines with my &#8220;Tu Quoque!&#8221; sign. But I&#8217;m trying to make a serious point, which is that all of us look for ways to defer unpleasant decisions into the future; we differ only on which decisions strike us as unpleasant.  Deferral is not a good strategy for problems of these potential magnitudes. Time gets rid of some problems, but it makes others, like demographic crises and cumulative environmental damage, worse, and as most of us know from our own experience, ignoring problems in the hope that they&#8217;ll go away generally results in a full scale disaster rather than a manageable inconvenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Arnold is posing the Social Security problem in terms of a lack of precautionary savings.  Jane suggests we liberals object to more savings, which cannot be true at least for this liberal.  My objection to the Bush tax cuts was precisely because it lowered national savings.  In his comments to my earlier post, Arnold appeared (to me at least) to change his position every time I tried to pin it down.  My Update II basically took his comment that the precautionary savings should come from stripping future benefits from the working poor so we don’t have to tax the “investor class”.  OK, now we are getting to my objection as this strikes me as a transfer of wealth from the working poor to the investor class.  That’s what liberals are objecting to – not a call for more savings.  </p>
<p>But my other objection to the analogy between the two long-run issues goes to the claim that money is fungible (perfect substitutes) to the realization that the global warming debate is over two goods that are not perfect substitutes: (a) a climate more favorable to general wellbeing and productivity; and (b) material goods (including productive machinery).  I trust Arnold Kling and Jane Galt understand that these two are not perfect substitutes.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Two days ago, I had a post looking at the growth rate in real GDP per capita by Presidential administration.  Yesterday, I looked at the grwoth rate in real GDP less change in debt per capita by Presidential administration.  I probably got more critical comments (and e-mail) about these two posts than about anything else I&#8217;ve written.  I thought it would be worth addressing some of those critiques in a post.  (Especially since I&#8217;ve been collecting data to do a follow-up.)</p>
<p>So to begin, I realize there was no analysis in these two posts and that I didn&#8217;t take into account any of the myriad of things that might have mattered.  I&#8217;ve had any number of posts on growth rates before in which I have tried to take into account lags and whatever other factors for which I could find data.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more.  This post was inspired by something else.  Republican Presidents are generally supported by people who call themselves &#8220;pro-growth.&#8221;  Republicans tell us that their policies will lead to more growth.  Presumably, then, we would expect to see faster growth when Republicans are President.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, one might insist that there are lagged effects that only kick in after 8 years of a Republican administration.  That might conceivably explain JFK-LBJ, or Carter, but not why it took so much longer for Reagan’s policies to kick in (i.e., GHW&#8217;s term didn’t go so well, and it took a bit of time for Clinton to start putting up numbers on growth).</p>
<p>Anyway, without redoing all the previous posts I&#8217;ve had, let me speculate on why we see what we see: </p>
<p>1.  Republicans generally (claim to) prefer smaller government.  In effect, this means less social programs.  At the margins, at the levels of spending on those programs that we&#8217;ve observed, additional dollars in those areas produce more growth than additional dollars spent on areas the Republicans prefer.<br />2.  Republicans (other than Ike) seem to have been more willing to run large deficits.  PGL and I (not to say folks at other blogs) have had posts showing that greater growth is achieved with smaller deficits or even small surpluses.  <br />3.  There is an optimal tax rate for producing growth because there is an optimal size of government.  I&#8217;ve had posts showing that this optimal tax rate is probably higher than it was, say, when Reagan left office.<br />4.  Republicans may be less competent than Democrats.  Reagan clearly had no idea what was going on by the end of his term.  Considering several times early on he confused movies with reality, perhaps he was always out of it.  GW has clearly been over his head from day one.  <br />5.  Republicans may take government less seriously.  GW has famously been running up his time in Crawford.  Reagan famously did the same in California and Camp David.  Ike was known for his time in the golf course, and Nixon&#8217;s hobby apparently was criticizing Jews and trying get his enemies.  By contrast, LBJ was known as a consummate deal maker (whether you liked him or not), Carter was such a micromanager he kept track of who was using the tennis courts, and the Clinton administration was known for its late meetings that required pizza deliveries.  <br />6.  Republicans may be more tolerant of corruption and corruption creates its own problems.  I’ve had posts looking at tax enforcement and the funding of the Treasury and the IRS budget that get at this.  Similarly, consider recent scandals.  Clinton lied about sex.  GHW claimed not to be in the loop about a violation of the National Security Act.  Reagan claimed he didn’t remember when it came to sending a couple of planes loaded with missiles to Iran.  <br />7.  Those who vote Republican may be more interested in substance than delivery for whatever reason.  Long time readers might recall my post on <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html">abortions and unwed motherhood</a> showing such a phenomenon may not be limited to economic issues.<br />8.  Shear coincidence/God dislikes Republican Presidents and always throws obstacles in their path.</p>
<p>Anyway, so there… some speculation on why we observe what observe.  Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about all of it.  But&#8230; regular readers know that I will happily put up posts written by the readers.   This includes posts with which I disagree, provided they are well thought out.  (Regular readers no doubt can recall several examples of this.)  My spreadsheets are available to anyone.  In my posts, I have also provided links to the original data.  If you feel something is wrong with the two posts I wrote… write a better one, and I will put it up.  Show me that its something else.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/guilty_as_charg.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/02/social_security_31.html">Arnold Kling</a> are having an interesting debate as to whether we should think of the future of Social Security in terms of precautionary savings – with a hat tip to <a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005080.html">Jane Galt</a>.  This is all very interesting but Arnold really needs to explain this line:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason we should try to fix Social Security now is that the cure can be painless now. The problem is that under conservative assumptions about productivity, promised future benefits exceed future revenues by an ever-growing amount. So cut promised future benefits, and then if productivity does well, you can restore benefits if you like. The point is, planning for the worst case scenario does not hurt anybody in the non-worst-case scenario.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to get nervous when I here someone talking about painless solutions.  There are some conservatives who emphasize the benefits of savings without noting that to get more capital accumulation – we have to cut consumption today.  Arnold may protest that he is talking about cutting promised future benefits.  OK, but then we don’t get more savings if we decide to cut consumption in the future rather than today.  Or as Mark replies:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m confused about something though. If you were to tell me that I will receive 1 million dollars on the day I turn 67 would that change my behavior today? Yes. I&#8217;m pretty sure it would. Would I feel better off today? Yes again. So, go in the other direction. If you tell me I will have less money in the future because my benefits will be cut, maybe not by a million dollars but by enough to matter, will that change my behavior today? Yes it will, and I’ll feel worse off. More importantly, is it reversible like Arnold says? Suppose I give up a vacation and save instead because I believe benefits will be cut in the future. I can&#8217;t always reverse that later (I can&#8217;t necessarily climb the same mountain or ski the same slopes when I&#8217;m older, and even if there&#8217;s no physical constraint, the opportunities will differ with time). Or maybe the benefit cuts make it so I can&#8217;t simultaneously send a child to college and save as much as I need to for retirement due to resource constraints. How does cutting future benefits, even probabilistically, leave me unaffected in such a case? The point is that changing expected future benefits alters the time paths for consumption and saving (a premise, or at least a hope, of those in favor of privatization of Social Security)  which, contrary to the claim above, does affect people &#8220;in the non-worst-case scenario.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Arnold – when you said painless, you seemed to suggest there is a free lunch.  I trust you realize there is no such thing.  I’m as confused as Mark is about this passage.  Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Arnold and I have traded comments under this post.  It would seem his position is that households don’t save enough and there is some magic public policy change that will fix that.  And I thought I was the liberal!  OK Arnold – what is the market failure and how is a change in public policy going to fix that?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Arnold and I have traded comments again.  Arnold seems to be frustrated with me that I don’t get his argument so he tries again.  As I read his latest comment, dare I try to interpret it?  Well let’s see how far I get this time.  He is saying that if we take away people’s promised benefits, they will save more.  Well, this is exactly what Ando and Modigliani might say as well so Arnold must be correct.  So if we take away a person’s expected future income, which is akin to a reduction in lifetime income, then this person will decide to consume less today so they can save more for their retirement.  No quarrel here, but isn’t a reduction in wealth equivalent to pain for that person.  So I ask again – what did Arnold mean by “painless”.  Painless to who?  Yep – I suspected there was some distributional twist to all of this and it seems Arnold has confirmed as much.</p>
<p>Let me go further by suggesting Jane Galt and Arnold have mischaracterized the liberal objection to their proposal.  It’s not that we don’t want people to save more.  Heavens – the deficit hawk wing of my party – to which I’m a member – have hammered the free lunch fiscal fiasco of Bush’s income tax cuts as reducing national savings.  But we have also long suspected that this was part of a grand plan to transfer wealth from the working poor to the “investor class” as Kudlow would have it.  If Jane Galt and Arnold Kling want more precautionary savings, I agree.  The question is how do we get there?  Raise taxes on the rich or go for this backdoor employment tax increase that Arnold is advocating.  I prefer the former.</p>

                                <p>Pseudo-expert on everything decides that the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDA0YzI0YzBlYTc1YmFmMTM3N2QxMDExZWIwYTE0M2E=">Minimum Wage Minimizes Jobs</a> by doing extensive empirical work, while watching checking out <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251578,00.html">Faux News</a>.  Yes, Brit Hume finds some anecdotal evidence in Arizona but then gets serious by checking out a Federal Reserve study. Actually, the Faux News link pulls up 2470 references to the Federal Reserve and Brit forgot to tell us which one.  But he did provide this:</p>
<blockquote><p>for every ten percent increase in the minimum wage &#8211; there is a corresponding two to three percent decrease in employment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that AB readers get the point but let’s say this really slowly so Jonah might be able to follow.  What this line means is that the labor demand curve is INELASTIC.  So with an elasticity of demand of only 0.2, labor income actually goes up by 8% if the wage increase is increased by 10%.  I do hope Jonah got this simple point finally – as I would hate to have to go over this ad nausam during office hours.</p>

                                <p>I often enjoy reading what Robert Reich has to say, but <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-balancing-budget-is-stupid-idea.html">this piece</a> just made me sad:<br />
<blockquote>The federal budget is just an accounting convention – and a lousy one at that. It doesn’t distinguish between three types of spending: (1) spending that&#8217;s necessary to pay off obligations made in the past, (2) spending intended to make us better off today, and (3) spending to make us more productive in the future. Any family knows the difference between past, present, and future – between, say, paying down the mortgage, going on an ocean cruise, or paying college tuition for the kids &#8230; But the federal budget doesn’t at all resemble a family budget. The federal budget is a static account that tells us nothing about past, present, or future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The family budget is also a static concept – and most households look at savings and investment decisions in terms of their long-term impact.  In this sense, the federal budget is like the family budget.  I’m sure Robert has heard of the Ando-Modigliani life-cycle model.  So the real point is whether we are running deficits to invest in our future.  The sad truth is that Bush’s fiscal fiasco has not only caused some to panic that we’ve spent the Social Security reserves but it has also likely reduced investment.  </p>
<p>Robert makes a few good point here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Price supports designed to protect today’s farmers are treated the same way as education and health care for our nation’s children. They both show up as categories in the yearly budget – even though the farm price supports are to keep a group of people secure today, while education and child health care are really investments in America’s future. Social Security surpluses show up in the budget as this year’s revenues that offset this year’s expenses. But in reality the surpluses are payments by post-war boomers who are still working – but who in a few years will be retired and making big withdrawals. What look like revenues will soon turn into big liabilities. The federal budget hides this inconvenient fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the unified deficit understates the general fund deficit precisely because it counts the Trust Fund surpluses as offsets.  So we really should be running unified surpluses.  His other points are that not all government spending is the same.  While that’s true, we still have to honor the long-run budget constraint – just like most families do.</p>

                                <p>His logic with respect to the alleged Iranian government culpability for Iranian munitions is noted <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002576.php">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll resist the temptation to draw an organizational chart, for obvious reasons. They&#8217;re part of the Iranian defense and intelligence establishment. They&#8217;re a major part of the Iranian government. Therefore, the actions of that force are the responsibility of that government. If that force is supplying technology for Shiite militants, that government is responsible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The military police and the CIA officers at the Abu Ghraib prison were part of the American defense and intelligence establishment.  Do we need to draw an organizational chart for the Undersecretary?  Just how desperate is President Bush to launch us into another war that will make us less safe?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">changes in real GDP per capita over Presidential administrations</a> beginning with Ike.  However, real GDP per capita can be boosted by Federal spending, and in any given year, Federal spending can be paid for by debt.  Because, as PGL and others keep reminding us, increasing the debt is merely a way to postpone taxes (preferably into someone else’s administration), it makes sense to look at the growth per capita in the real GDP less the change in the real debt.</p>
<p>Data for the total debt held by the public <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm">from from 1950 to 2005</a> can be obtained from the Treasury; this data set provides data from 1953 to 1985 for December 31st of each year, and for 1985 to 2005 for September 30th of each year.  Data for September 2006 was also obtained <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/NPGateway">from the Treasury</a>.   </p>
<p>As in yesterday’s post, real GDP per capita came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  However, to match the debt series, this time I used Q4 data through 1985, and Q3 data thereafter.</p>
<p>Table 1 below shows the annualized percentage change in real GDP less debt per capita.  It also shows the results for the best and worst years or the administration, and the average of the annual growth rates when the best and worst years are left out.  Growth rates are calculated using the last year before the administration took office to the last full year for which the administration was in office.</p>
<p>Table 1<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7KoVHjgI/AAAAAAAAAB0/pqbqidBc15I/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7KoVHjgI/AAAAAAAAAB0/pqbqidBc15I/s320/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Table 2 is similar to Table 1, but it assumes an administration may have little control over results for its first year.  Thus, growth rates are calculated using the first year in which the administration is in office to its last full year in office.</p>
<p>Table 2<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7PIVHjhI/AAAAAAAAAB8/iyJhI810pZw/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdM7PIVHjhI/AAAAAAAAAB8/iyJhI810pZw/s320/God+Punishes,+part+2,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Whether we look at things Table 1’s way, or Table 2’s, the 3 best performing administrations were the 3 Democratic administrations.  If I remember my probability theory, if you have an urn with 8 balls that differ only by color, where are 3 black balls and 5 are white balls, the odds of randomly selecting all 3 that are white when 3 of them are removed from the urn are (3/8) * (2/7) * (1/6) or 1.8%.  </p>
<p>Put another way, Democratic administrations produce better growth than Republican administrations.  Either its because Democratic administrations have tended to behave more rationally, or its because God really, really doesn’t like it when we vote for Republican Presidents.  Take your pick.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Note… in the comments to yesterday’s post, it was noted that Congress has a lot to do with this.  I hope to have a follow up using Congressional data some time soon.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/02/#000786">Bill Polley</a> discovers some leftwing stupidity on this topic as reported <a href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/W/WISCONSIN_GAS_TAX?SITE=WIRE&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Gov. Jim Doyle proposes taxing big oil companies more than $270 million over the next two years to help pay for the state&#8217;s transportation needs. Doyle said the assessment will equate to $1.50 per barrel of oil sold in the state, and the companies would be prohibited from passing the tax on to customers at the pump. Violations carry a criminal penalty of up to six months in prison.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we did levy a tax on the actual barrel of oil, the incidence of this tax will be jointly borne by consumers and suppliers with the division depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.  I guess the Governor could make like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/rightwinger-praises-jimmy-carters-oil.html">President Carter</a> and impose price controls, which would likely lead to shortages.  </p>
<p>But what about a profits tax?  Bill writes:<br />
<blockquote>Windfall profits taxes are not good policy. They severely distort incentives and change the firms&#8217; attitude toward risk. The capricious nature with which these taxes could be imposed, removed, or changed just adds to the distortion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/did_jimmy_carters_oil_windfall.html#015474">Dean Baker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>While there is probably never a pure rent (meaning someone gets paid more than necessary to get them to provide a good or service), rents are generally a good place to look for revenue. The distortions from a well-designed windfall profits tax  are almost certainly lower than the distortions from income or sales taxes. If we can substitute a windfall profits tax for more distortionary taxes, we are almost certainly coming out ahead.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The U.S. federal budget surplus widened by 82% in January to $38.2 billion from $21 billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department reported Monday.  The surplus is slightly below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of about $40 billion. January usually as a surplus month because many individuals must make estimated tax payments, analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we typically have January cash inflows and this one fell below expectations.  Hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/02/more_fiscal_hokum_from_the_right.php">Mark Kleiman</a> who is having a grand old time with the rightwing’s inability to understand even basic concepts like reading.  Mark is even offering bets up to <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/01/when_will_the_b.html">The Skeptical Optimist</a>.  You would think an optimist would unconditionally take such a bet – assuming he really believes that the Federal government is about to run a surplus.</p>

                                <p><a href="https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/&#038;location=http%3A//www.ft.com/cms/s/0d0fb912-bad5-11db-bbf3-0000779e2340.html">Raghuram Rajan</a> joins the insufficiency of investment demand club:<br />
<blockquote>Signs of extremely benign financing conditions are plentiful, ranging from low long-term interest rates to historically narrow credit spreads on risky assets. Many observers call this a liquidity glut, thereby implicating central banks and their accommodative policies. But in my view, these conditions may primarily be driven by a global shortage of hard assets.  My argument relies on two global ingredients. The first is that, in spite of substantial worldwide income growth, if anything there has been an increase in the desire to save out of it. In emerging markets where income growth is rapid, savings increase. Household consumption in developing countries takes time to catch up with higher incomes – either because households take time to be confident that the increase is permanent or because credit constraints prevent them from borrowing to consume against future incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/the_global_shor.html">Mark Thoma</a> wonders what I might say:<br />
<blockquote>He might also note that while low investment demand is usually explained by factors such as the Asian crisis, the collapse of the dot-com bubble, and 9/11, all of which diminished businesses&#8217; willingness to undertake risky investments, this adds additional factors associated with &#8220;global ingredients&#8221; such as competition from emerging markets. With the additional uncertainty these factors add, it &#8220;makes less and less sense for corporations in industrial countries to make large domestic investments in the manufacturing sector.&#8221; However, if it were just a decline in real investment, we would see low interest rates but also low output (casting this in IS-LM language, think of the IS curve shifting in). However, if there is also a large supply of liquidity, then interest rates would be even lower but output would not necessarily decline, a result consistent with the robust global output we have seen in recent years (think of the IS curve shifting in and the LM curve shifting out). It is also consistent with the low rates of inflation we have seen globally since the low investment demand will offset price pressure from the increased liquidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>That about covers it.  I will say that back in 2001 that I was very critical of Bush’s fiscal stimulus as I thought the expansionary monetary policy itself would take care of any recessionary tendencies from the inward shift of investment demand.  Over time, I began to change my mind as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates below 1% and the recovery was still anemic.  The good news, however, is that the investment slump has started turning itself around and our economy is getting back towards full employment.  The bad news is that Bush’s fiscal stimulus has not turned around – which has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  So the crowding-out effect I worried about then is something that we should worry about now.  Of course we could pray for a miracle and hope that this White House does decide to do something novel during its term in office – get serious about fiscal responsibility.</p>
