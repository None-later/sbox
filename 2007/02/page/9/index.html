                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The latest attempt by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmJiZDEyYzkxYWE0OWYxMWY4Y2ZjYzI2YmNmOGExMDE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> to do economics starts off with an obvious observation:<br />
<blockquote>Public policy is all about trade-offs. Economists understand this better than politicians because voters want to have their cake and eat it too, and politicians think whatever is popular must also be true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that Goldberg lets Lawrence Kudlow oversea the usual National Review economic stupidity that pretends there is no law of scarcity.  But then his latest gets incredibly stupid:<br />
<blockquote>Earth got about 0.7 degrees Celsius warmer in the 20th century while it increased its GDP by 1,800 percent, by one estimate. How much of that 0.7 degrees can be laid at the feet of that 1,800 percent is unknowable, but let’s stipulate that all of the warming was the result of our prosperity and that this warming is in fact indisputably bad</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if average annual growth was between 2.9% and 3% per year, we are producing about 18 times what we produced a century ago.  Of course, that would grossly overestimate the increase in per capita income unless we had zero population growth for the past century.  But this is not why Goldberg’s op-ed was incredibly stupid.  He is assuming that there is some fixed temperature to GDP relationship.  In other words, it is not possible to alter how we produce goods so as to not cause global warming.  But his assumption sort of denies the possibility of improvements in technology that allow us to have more goods and a better environment.  But then – what would you expect from a National Review nitwit?  At least he understands the law of scarcity, which makes this op-ed a vast improvement over the usual nonsense from the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to one of our readers for letting us know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png">this graph</a> showing average annual global temperatures.  It does look like this average rose by 0.7 degrees Celsius over the past century &#8211; but notice something else that Mr. Goldberg failed to mention. In the last half century, the increase has been about 0.6 degrees Celsius.  Was Mr. Goldberg too stupid to check the data – or was he simply exhibiting the standard behavior of National Review writers who deem their readers to be stupid and worthy of being lied to?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2007/02/in_spite_of_eco.html">Martin Wolf</a> leads a discussion on the Economics of Climate Change.  Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/global_warming_.html">Mark Thoma</a> for picking up on a suggestion from <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2007/02/in_spite_of_eco.html#comment-60088170">Andrew Oswald</a> entitled the Global Warming Bond.  Mark notes:<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s a good trick &#8211; charging future generations to prevent environmental damage that would occur before they are born and then affect them. I wonder if we can get the unborn to pay us not to do other sorts of damage, kind of a protection racket. Pay us off in bonds or we&#8217;ll pollute this river!</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Senator <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N06252236.htm">Joe Lieberman</a> as well as a NY Times opinion piece today (behind the subscription wall) both have called for a war tax to fund the Iraq conflict and to have all Americans share in the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now I am definitely of two minds here.  The economist in me says that whether or not we like to admit it, we are passing a de facto tax bill whenever we make an expenditure because even if we borrrow to fund the war effort, those bonds will have to be paid someday and it is tax receipts that will do it.  So if we don’t pay for the war today then our kids will do it later on – not something we ought to wish on them.</p>
<p>The political activist in me says no way do I want to pay for this war.  I was against it and the President lied to get us into it, all the while being cheered on by many who even today cant admit they were wrong.  Let them pay for it if they like it so much.  Add to this the injustice of proposing a broad based tax to pay for the war just after massive tax cuts benefitting the richest among us.  What that means at the end of the day is a massive shift in paying for the war – First make sure the rich get out from under and then stick it to everyone with a regressive tax like the one on phone calls proposed by the NYT opinion piece.</p>
<p>I have a better idea.  Since it isnt possible to target a tax on those who support the war, lets at least make sure it isnt as regressive as some of the proposals out there.  How about lets repeal Bush’s tax cuts on those who make more than, say, a quarter of million dollars a year?  And if Republicans and war supporters are more heavily represented in that group then that would be just little bit of cosmic justice wouldn’t it?</p>

                                <p>Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House ranks right behind Dick Cheney in the line of succession to replace George Bush as President.  So the fact that the Pentagon is providing her with a military jet in the same fashion that they provided the previous Speaker is no surprise.  Yet certain rightwingers – and a few other nuts such as Lou Dobbs – thinks this is a scandal, which is just stupid.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/us/politics/09pelosi.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;ex=1170997200&#038;en=180fe8f62263bb4e&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Carl Hulse</a> recaps this faux story noting Tony Snow calling this a silly story.  Hulse finishes his article with:<br />
<blockquote>Some Republicans were put off by the flight fight. “This is a bunch of baloney,” said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, who said he had flown on Mr. Hastert’s military plane. “Next week,” Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said, “we are going to steal their mascot and short-sheet their beds.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We also learned that some Congressmen were criticizing Pelosi’s love of chocolate. Maybe they should join her on her next flight to San Francisco so they can visit <a href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq">Ghirardelli Square</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since the title of the piece by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020900432.html">Darlene Superville</a> (House GOP Blasts Pelosi for Plane Request) was a lie, her lead had to be dishonest as well:<br />
<blockquote>For most of the past five weeks, House Republicans could do little else but watch as majority Democrats passed major legislation without giving them a chance to propose changes or offer alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Democrats did pass major legislation – often with House Republicans voting for these bills.  And yes, they had opportunities to debate.  More than the previous Speaker allowed the minority party.  In fact, read further in this story and you’ll see:<br />
<blockquote>The Republicans&#8217; amendment to the alternative fuels bill amounted to a dig at Pelosi; it specifically mentioned passenger planes &#8220;capable of transcontinental flights.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a second, didn’t she write that the Republicans did not have any chances of propose amendments? </p>

                                <p>My apologies to our readers but certain rightwing hacks are truly out of control – such of Bowtie Jr. (Tucker – you have to live with the fact that however pathetic you become, you still are not quite George Will):<br />
<blockquote>But first, global warming. An international report appeared the other day echoing what Al Gore has said for a long time: global warming is real and civilization probably is causing it. The majority of climate scientists appear to agree with this conclusion. The majority, but not all of them. George Taylor, Oregon’s longtime state climatologist, holds a contrary view. Taylor believes global warming is mostly the result of what he calls natural variations, long-term trends that humans can’t control. Among climatologists, this is not considered a crackpot view, but political in Oregon, it is heresy. The Democratic governor of that state has announced that he will trip George Taylor of his title for daring to question the causes of global warming. Keep in mind that the governor is not a scientist. He hasn’t cited any dishonesty in Taylor’s scholarship. He just doesn’t think he ought to be allowed to disagree with the conventional wisdom on global warming. But wait. Whatever happened to freedom of speech and the sanctity of the scientific process? The very people you’d expect to stand up for a scientist’s right to practice science in the face of politics have been silent in the case of George Taylor. Why? Because his position isn’t fashionable at the moment, and in the end that’s all that counts, unfortunately.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relax Tucker – no one is taking away your freedom to be always wrong as <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/08/oregon-denier">Faiz</a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>1) Taylor is not the “state climatologist.” Oregon abolished the position in 1989. He was bestowed the title by Oregon State University , not by Gov. Kulongoski or the state of Oregon.<br />2) Taylor is not a “climatologist.” Taylor is a meteorologist.  He does not possess a PhD or have a background in climatology.<br />3) He will not be fired. Taylor will not lose his job or income, which comes from Oregon State University. He will merely be stripped of his title, which he never earned but claims to retain. Gov. Kulongoski has the right to appoint aclimatologist who is an expert in the field and adheres to the state’s climate policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just wish NBC and MSNBC will exercise their right to hire competent people for their news shows.  So why does a goofball like Tucker Carlson still have a job?</p>

                                <p>As most sentient creatures and some of the folks who write at the Corner have noticed by now, the Bush administration tends to announce bad news on a Friday afternoon. I figured I&#8217;d get a jump on the rush and announce my impending demise, and that of the the Girlfriend. Yup, we&#8217;re throwing in the towel. The plan is to get married this weekend. Anyway, the friends, relatives and assorted riff-raff have started showing up, there are some last minute details to look at and I still have actual work that needs doing. Plus it occurs to me that perhaps right about now I should learn how to dance &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want to procrastinate. </p>
<p>All of which is to say you probably won&#8217;t hear from me at least until Monday, possibly Tuesday, but as far as I know PGL and Steve Kyle don&#8217;t have an excuse of this caliber so don&#8217;t go nowhere. </p>
<p>(BTW&#8230; we&#8217;re doing this wedding thing under protest. The Girlfriend wanted the Las Vegas experience and I was eyeing the J of P route, but we were over-ridden.) </p>
<p>Now I know you&#8217;re probably worried we&#8217;ve neglected what&#8217;s really important. However, nothing could be farther from the truth. The Girlfriend and I have been discussing this for weeks now, and we finally came up with an appropriate way for her to be referred to in my posts from here on out. The first thought was Mrs. cactus, but best laid plans often don&#8217;t come to pass, so it seemed a bit presumptuous. (After all, its not too late for one or both of us to weasel out.) So we decided upon a moniker that would be accurate regardless of what happens in the next couple of days. Until further notice, she will be referred to as the &#8220;Ex-Girlfriend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toodles.</p>

<p>Recently both our own <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/david-altig-on-national-savings-and-why.html">pgl</a> and <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/02/us_saving_not_q.html">David Altig</a> take on the debate about savings.  David provides us with a very useful graph (showing some slight  improvement in savings in the most recent quarters) but then throws out the idea that household net wealth is still growing.  <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> replies that net wealth isn’t growing all that fast and is a notoriously noisy series anyway.  I want to make clear a few fundamental issues that I am sure David and <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> know about but which may remain a bit unclear after reading the most recent posts</p>
<p>1.  Savings is a flow and net wealth is a stock.  They are NOT different ways to measure the same thing and comparing them directly is comparing apples to oranges.  Savings is one of the ways in which net wealth is either increased (if savings is positive) or decreased (if savings is negative) in any particular period.  But net wealth also depends on capital gains which for households depend among other things on both the stock market and the value of their houses.</p>
<p>2.  To count capital gains in your house as an increase in your savings is a mistake we saw many people make during the tech stock boom a few years ago.  Your balance sheet may look great for a while but you don’t really have the money until you actually sell the asset.  It would be just as foolish today for people to say “Hey aren’t I the smart one!!  I have so much wealth in this house I am not going to sell that I should buy a new car, a plasma TV, and a European vacation!!!”</p>
<p>3.  <stockticker>PGL</stockticker> is 100% correct that asset values tend to bounce around a lot more than many other values.  I think his point about the growth in household wealth over the past few years is well taken but you could easily get different results if you choose your beginning and ending points carefully.  That is precisely what is worrying &#8211; If the housing boom ends soon as is predicted in some quarters the slight growth in household net wealth pgl notes could very easily turn into a negative number.</p>
<p>4.  The main point in my original post (which remains true even with pgl’s correction and David’s comments) is shown very clearly in David’s graph.  Those of an incurably optimistic bent – certainly a good quality to have – can hang their hat on the slight upturn in savings rates over the past few quarters.  But I defy anyone to draw a regression line through those series for the past two decades and come up with anything that has a positive slope or to be happy about where those rates are at the present time compared with other industrial countries or our own history.  And THAT was the original thought that inspired me to write about this.</p>
<p>Savings rates are usually a slow moving variable.  They don’t typically change drastically from quarter to quarter or year to year unless there is something forcing them to which is why it took 20 years for ours to decline from somewhere in the vicinity of 10% to somewhere in the vicinity of 0% or a little above.  What worries me is the possibility that something may indeed force an adjustment back the other way.  Remember that our desire to dissave must be mirrored by somebody else’s desire to save (i.e. lend us money).  It is still not at all inevitable that we will have an unpleasant adjustment forced on us but we would be foolish to act as if the current situation is either inherently stable or capable of lasting indefinitely.  If such an adjustment IS forced on us, capital gains in our houses wont help us much.  We are unlikely to all be able to sell them very fast even if they maintain their increases in value of the past few years.  And as for the likelihood that those values will keep rising all I can say is that I wouldnt want to bet the rent on it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjYzZWJhMTMyZTBjZTBkYmM2Y2VmNTJiZjQ4Yzg4ODM=">Momma’s Boy</a> wrote yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>But the vitriol and bullying of this crowd is something to behold.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are wondering what this is about, see <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/02/jonah_goldberg_day">Matthew Yglesias</a> about that bet regarding whether they’d be an Iraq civil war.  Well, there is.  But the fun part was Jonah’s “little smear-job”:<br />
<blockquote>One caveat: Because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right to bet on such serious matters for personal gain, if I win, I&#8217;ll donate the money to the USO. He can give it to the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade or whatever his favorite charity is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah can sure dish out the cheap shots, but he can’t take people firing back.  What a cry baby!  </p>
<p>And his ability to predict what will happen in Iraq (or lack thereof) is what one would expect from a National Review neocon nitwit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/47729">Jeff Cohen</a> unloads on Momma’s Boy as he provides some historical context:<br />
<blockquote>The bet was offered near the end of an overheated blogo-debate between Goldberg (at National Review Online) and Dr. Juan Cole, the Middle East scholar from University of Michigan.</p></blockquote>
<p>It did become overheated as Mr. Goldberg refused to stop – even as he was making the usual fool out of himself.  But check it out again as some of Dr. Cole’s comebacks were priceless!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: When <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2005/02/playing-with-human-lives-goldbergs.html">Juan Cole</a> turned down the bet as being disgusting, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_02_06_corner-archive.asp#055680">Momma’s Boy</a> called it HIGH-LARIOUS and wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Lame doc, very, very lame. I&#8217;m going to take my victory lap now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah Goldberg can advocate sending others to war but he stays at home and makes jokes about it.  Dr. Cole was right – disgusting.</p>

                                <p>So what non-Economics blogs should someone interested in Economics read?  I&#8217;m thinking in terms of blogs that sometimes touch on economic issues, such as <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/">Obsidian Wings</a> or <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/">Matthew Yglesias</a>.  Also, policy blogs such as <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/">Ezra Klein</a> or <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/">the Carpetbagger</a>.  And don&#8217;t limit them to merely left leaning blogs.  </p>
<p>So&#8230; what should we all be reading if we want to know what&#8217;s going on?</p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, we had a thread about what people who don&#8217;t know much about economics should read if they want to learn more.  Taking it further, what about blogs?  In your opinion, what are the best economic blogs?  Which are must read?</p>
<p>(BTW.  Two rules.  One:  nobody mentions Angry Bear.  Presumably many of you here get value from the blog, but this post was written more with &#8220;what else should we all be reading?&#8221; in mind than fishing for compliments.  Two:  keep this economics blogs.  I&#8217;ll have a second post about non-economics blogs that those with an interest in economics should read.)</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update.  It occurs to me that comments may be biased toward the larger blogs.  There are many fine blogs that are virtually unknown because most of us have never even heard of them.  If you know of any such blog &#8211; perhaps the writer(s) only puts something up now and then, but its usually incisive &#8211; please mention it.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I grew up in the 1960’s thinking Meet the Press was a first class show on the issues of the day.  Over the past few years, I have watched its current host ruin this once great program.  But I should just turn the microphone over to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/02/08/BL2007020801013_pf.html">real journalist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If you&#8217;re a journalist, and a very senior White House official calls you up on the phone, what do you do? Do you try to get the official to address issues of urgent concern so that you can then relate that information to the public? Not if you&#8217;re NBC Washington bureau chief Tim Russert. When then-vice presidential chief of staff Scooter Libby called Russert on July 10, 2003, to complain that his name was being unfairly bandied about by MSNBC host Chris Matthews, Russert apparently asked him nothing. And get this: According to Russert&#8217;s testimony yesterday at Libby&#8217;s trial, when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record. That&#8217;s not reporting, that&#8217;s enabling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan is not just going over Tim Russert:<br />
<blockquote>And the behavior of elite members of Washington&#8217;s press corps &#8211; sometimes appearing more interested in protecting themselves and their cozy &#8220;sources&#8221; than in informing the public &#8211; is also being exposed for all the world to see. For Russert, yesterday&#8217;s testimony was the second source of trial-related embarrassment in less than two weeks. The first came when Cathie Martin, Cheney&#8217;s former communications director, testified that the vice president&#8217;s office saw going on Russert&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; as a way to go public but &#8220;control [the] message.&#8221; In other words: Sure, there might be a tough question or two, but Russert could be counted on not to knock the veep off his talking points &#8211; and, in that way, give him just the sort of platform he was looking for.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the NBC wing of Faux News.  This is the same Russert who went “no, no, no, no, no” to Howard Dean back during the 2004 campaign when Dean got the number of troops in Iraq correct.  And there was a second “no, no, no, no, no” when Dean answered one of Russert’s Social Security questions correctly.  But I guess we should forgive this last one as Russert is about as stupid on the Social Security issue as it gets – even if he pretends he’s an expert (expert at reader Karl Rove spin perhaps).  </p>
<p>But go back to those Russert interviews of Dick Cheney and watch how many times the Vice President has flat out lied to the host of Meet the Press.  Why does Cheney lie to Mr. Russert?  Because he knows that when he does so – Russert will say “thank you Mr. Vice President for sharing your views”. </p>
<p>Memo to NBC News – fire Tim Russert TODAY and hire someone who can restore Meet the Press to where it used to be when I was young.</p>
