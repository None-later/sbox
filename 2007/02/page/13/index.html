<div>While <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/cutting-farm-subsidies.html">Cactus</a> is hopeful that President Bush meant it when he proposed to reduce <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/site/premium/access-registered.intercept">farm subsidies</a>, permit me to be a bit cynical. Now I know that the Department of Agriculture’s budget for 2006 was only $96 billion, which translates into 0.72% of GDP. But the budget for 2001 was only $68 billion, which translates into 0.68% of GDP. In other words, during the last five years, nominal DOA spending rose by 41% as compared to the 31% growth rate in nominal GDP.</p>
<p>By comparison, total Federal spending in 2006 was 37.7% higher than it was in 2001. In other words, the ratio of Federal spending to GDP rose from 19.4% in 2001 to 20.3% in 2006. The Department of Defense, for example, commands a much larger portion of either the Federal budget or GDP – and it appears that this gigantic spending machine will not face cuts.</p>
<p>President Bush has lately been pretending that he is a small government. He certainly wasn’t for the first six years in office and I seriously doubt we’ll see cuts in Federal spending that will match the reductions in taxes he keeps promising to make permanent.</p></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div><strong>Update</strong>: I owe our readers a couple of things. First, a major thank you to Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation for the comment. He certainly know the details of the Department of Agriculture better than I do – and he sort of goes to the left of me on this one. I expect if he and I could be in charge of our farm policy, we’d find a lot of common ground moving towards less trade restrictions and less Federal spending. I should also note that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/stan_collender_.html">Brad DeLong</a> found common ground with Brian even if Brad added an originally extra “e” to his last name (now corrected). </div>
<p>
<div>The second thing is the graph of defense spending relative to GDP, which had dropped 4% during Clinton’s second term but is now around 4.7%. I suspect Brian and I would agree that it’d be nice if we could reduce defense spending, but this is not likely to happen in the next couple of years. </div>
<p>
<div>I know I’m sometimes hard on the Heritage Foundation, but as a member of the deficit hawk of the Democratic Party – I appreciate Brian’s efforts at pushing for fiscal responsibility. We on the left owe him two things – our support and spelling his name correctly. </div>

                                <p>I cannot believe that Lawrence Kudlow let <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTE4ZGE5OTM5OTc5NjQwNTg5ZjMzOGM3MGE1NzMwNjQ=">Thomas Nugent</a> put this out:<br />
<blockquote>A few years back, traditionalists said that paying for the Iraq war would result in bigger budget deficits and rising interest rates, which would crowd out private investment. Yet, here we are &#8211; four years later &#8211; with low interest rates, rising investment, a booming economy, and a shrinking deficit. Then Hurricane Katrina hit, after which President Bush announced a plan to spend $200 billion to rebuild the ravaged Gulf Coast. The opposition responded that the resulting larger budget deficit would penalize future generations and drive interest rates higher. Some politicians even wanted to cut spending, postpone tax cuts, and raise taxes to pay for the hurricane damage. Yet here we are &#8211; one-and-a-half years later &#8211; with lower interest rates, a growing economy, rising incomes, and mounting wealth via record highs in the stock market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we get to the really stupid parts of this, let me backtrack and say that I can believe that Kudlow would allow stupid writing to be placed at the National Review given all the stupid things Kudlow has written himself. What I can’t believe is that the National Review has let an advocate of more government spending loose.<br />
<blockquote>Bernanke recently spoke extensively about the risks of a growing budget deficit, and of how it could precipitate federal insolvency and slow economic growth as investment is crowded out. Fortunately, Bernanke’s forecasting of Armageddon is based on the same traditional approach to fiscal policy practiced by many of today’s deficit hawks; it’s an approach that is easily refuted, as problem-solvers viewing the situation through an outsider’s lens might attest. Essentially, there is no relationship between budget deficits and insolvency. In fact, as former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pointed out, with a floating exchange rate, there is no such thing as federal insolvency. Rather, the problem is the risk of future inflation caused by excessive federal-government demands on the private sector. But somehow Bernanke, our top inflation fighter, overlooks this fact, focusing instead on nonexistent insolvency risks. This insolvency issue is not unlike the accusation that, unless something is done, the Social Security system will go bankrupt. Again, one must understand how the U.S. government functions in a floating-exchange-rate environment. In effect, fiscal policies &#8211; i.e., spending and taxation &#8211; are not constrained by some fixed asset, such as the gold in Fort Knox. This had been the case prior to 1971, when the U.S. was constrained by the gold standard. But today the federal government can write as many checks as it desires, with the only limitation being the inflation risk created by excessive demands on the private sector. As an example, the federal government writes checks to construction companies for aircraft carriers, just as it writes checks to Social Security recipients in retirement. These entities then deposit their checks at local banks. When each check clears, the Federal Reserve credits the local bank’s reserve account at the Fed, after which the local bank credits the corporate or individual account with what is known as “good” funds. Operationally, virtually all of the federal government’s “spending” consists of the Fed crediting an account — that’s it. So essentially, there is no distinction between printing money and not printing money. Similarly, there is no federal “box of money” which receives tax collections and the proceeds from new Treasury securities, with these proceeds then available for use by the government through spending or lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect that Nugent never read Ben Bernanke’s testimony or the similar testimony from his predecessor. Both Federal Reserve chairmen were warning of the dangers of continuing to run large deficits for decades – not some one-off spending to address a single natural disaster. Heck, even the Iraq War does not constitute very long-term fiscal stimulus. And if Nugent thinks the Federal debt to GDP ratio can rise forever, he’s wrong. At some point, people will lose faith in even Federal bonds if we decide to permanently run the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that has infected us for the past six years.</p>
<p>Nugent’s time horizon seems to be limited to the last four years (dating back to before we invaded Iraq). It turns out that we entered 2003 with an employment to population ratio of only 62.5% and saw this drop to 62.0% by September 2003. So a little short-term fiscal stimulus from more government spending might have been prudent fiscal policy if it were combined with a commitment to move back to fiscal restraint in the long-run.</p>
<p>But could someone tell me what Nugent means by “yet here we are &#8211; one-and-a-half years later &#8211; with lower interest rates, a growing economy, rising incomes, and mounting wealth via record highs in the stock market.” The interest rate on ten-year Federal bonds, which was 4% as of mid-2005 ended 2006 above 4.5%. If Nugent thinks fiscal stimulus lowers interest rates, he really should listen more carefully to Ben Bernanke.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While we’re on the topic of really dumb things, perhaps I should relay something emailed to me by our friend Mark Thoma – the latest from <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/02/float_the_fed_funds_rate.html">John Tammy</a> and his sidekick Wayne Jett:<br />
<blockquote>Laffer Curve adherents should not be surprised that inflation is spurred by rate hikes. Just as a rising income tax rate drives the marginal producer to the sidelines, increased interest costs drain capital accounts and discourage productive investment by reducing profits. Dollar demand decreases and inflationary pressures increase when central bank actions cool economic growth. The dollar weakens as the economy weakens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tight monetary policy leads to more inflation and dollar devaluation?  Thank goodness we have Ben Bernanke heading the FED and not clowns like these two.  Just imagine it – more tax cuts, higher government spending, and monetary expansion all at the same time! Worry about inflation?  Heavens no – not as long as one is wearing the makeup, the big shoes, and the rest of that clown suit!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands of the nation&#8217;s richest farmers would lose their government subsidies under a Bush administration plan to curb farm spending.</p>
<p>Proposals released Wednesday would cut spending by $18 billion over the next five years. They represent President Bush&#8217;s vision of a new farm bill.</p>
<p>Anyone making more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income would be cut off from farm payments under Bush&#8217;s plan.</p>
<p>These producers, about 80,000 in all, are among the top 2.3 percent of taxpayers, officials said.</p>
<p>For those who are eligible, the ceiling on payments would still be $360,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully, this for real.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="content">Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 111,000 in January, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 4.6 percent</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the unemployment rate increased from 4.5% in December to 4.6% last month as the household survey reported an employment of only 31,000. The low growth in employment means the employment to population ratio declined from 63.4% to 63.3%. The enthusiasm of Jonah Goldberg’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-lows-for-unemployment-jonah.html">economic gurus</a> might be a little tempered by today’s news. The average workweek also declined. Combined with a very modest increase in the nominal hourly wage, the fall in the hours worked per week led to a fall in average weekly earnings. In short, a rather disappointing piece of news.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: I need to get up earlier as our friend <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/02/january-employment-report.html">CalculatedRisk</a> reported the news before this sleepy Bear again. But when he did, the BLS database was down so he had to rely on <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/us-jan-nonfarm-payrolls-up/story.aspx?guid=%7BF16FC978-2627-4C81-8EEC-F5DCE66C05D4%7D">this account</a>, which noted that the expected employment was 170,000 and added:<br />
<blockquote>The details of the report suggested some softening in the labor market</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that CalculatedRisk also lives on the West Coast, might I suggest to his wife that she turn off the alarm clock next month so sleepy Bear might for once blog on this first?</p>

<p>For those keeping score at home, here at Angry Bear we’ve already posted in detail on Myths 1 through 4…<br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/heritage-quality-research-plagiarizing.html">PGL’s post on Riedl Myth 1</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/brian-riedls-first-myth.html">My post on Riedl Myth 1</a>.<br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/brian-riedls-myths-2-and-4.html">Alkali19’s post on Myths 2 and 4</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/riedls-myth-3.html">My post on Riedl Myth 3</a><br />Also, reader NS has given us an overview of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/reader-ns-view-of-riedls-10-myths.html">the Riedl approach</a>.</p>
<p>Moving right along… <br />“Myth #5: The Bush tax cuts are to blame for the projected long-term budget deficits.<br />Fact: Projections show that entitlement costs will dwarf the projected large revenue increases.”</p>
<p>Riedl has a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/images/chart3_lg.gif">graph</a> to illustrate how spending is projected to increase faster than tax revenues.  The caption on the graph says “Source:  Calculations Based on data from CBO Long Term Budget Outlook, December 2005.”  </p>
<p>Riedl goes on:  “Overall, revenues are projected to increase from 18 percent of GDP to almost 23 percent. Spending is projected to increase from 20 percent of GDP to at least 38 percent. Even repealing all of the 2001 and 2003 cuts would merely shave the projected budget deficit of 15 percent of GDP by less than 1 percentage point, and that assumes no negative feedback from raising taxes.”</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m concerned about two things.  One is that the CBO is required to make all kinds of assumptions, which makes using its forecasts problematic.  The second is exactly what Riedl means by “based on data from CBO Long Term Budget Outlook, December 2005.”  In particular, the words “based on.”  To get an idea of what they might be, Riedl himself described many of them <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/wm970.cfm">here</a>.  Considering the extensive use of cherrypicking, misleading data, and a few downright inaccuracies I certainly am not about to trust Riedl’s, um, “corrections”, especially when I don’t have the methodology for the corrections in front of me.  (Note to Riedl – some of us make sure readers know they can have our spreadsheets whenever we do anything that isn’t completely straightforward.  Its called transparency.  It makes people trust us a bit more when they can check our work.)  </p>
<p>Unlike Riedl, I’m not paid for this and I have to earn a living.  So I’m not going to do the forecasting myself right at this time.  I would merely like to point out that Riedl seems to be doing a static analysis based on percentages of GDP.  I would also note – it is easier to forecast the past than the future.  So let’s try a simple static Riedl-style analysis on the past.  </p>
<p>Since Riedl used data from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB Table 1.3</a> for some of his Myths, let’s do the same.  Table 1 below shows the Federal Revenues, Outlays, Surplus or Deficit for the unified budget (i.e., it includes revenues from Social Security) for 1997 through 2005.  (I stopped at 2005 because Table 1.3 does not yet have actual data for 2006.)   Note that there were surpluses in 1998, 1999, and 2000.  If you go back to table 1.3, you’ll note that the deficit shrunk every year from beginning in 1992 to 2000 – Riedl strikes me as the kind of guy who would give credit to the Republican Revolution that began in 1995 rather than Clinton, who took office in 1993.) </p>
<p>Table 1 also includes “change in revenue from 2000” and “change in outlays from 2000”, 2000.  Note that changes in revenue since 2000 have been bigger than changes in spending.  The boys at the Heritage Foundation might believe that going from a 2.4 percent of GDP surplus in 2000 to a 2.6 percent of GDP deficit is due more to 1.7 percent of GDP increase in spending than a 3.4 percent reduction in tax revenue, but the rest of us have a grasp of simple arithmetic.  (Well, not everyone – Andrew Sullivan did link approvingly to this nonsense.)</p>
<p>Table 2 looks at changes in revenue and changes in spending from 1999.  (I’m not Riedl – I don’t want anyone accusing me of picking the best year.)  Table 3 uses 1998.  Table 4 uses 1997, the last deficit year.  Table 5 uses 2001.  I note that the only times changes in spending exceed changes in tax revenues were in years that Clinton ran a surplus – put another way, some years the increase in the surplus were more due to tax revenues, some years they were more due to spending cuts.  But the changes since GW took office – well, the effect of tax cuts is greater than the effect of spending increases, at least when it comes to killing the surplus.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update.  Oooh.  We have temporarilly attracted Riedl&#8217;s attention.  See the comments, which appear to be mostly generic, but there&#8217;s also this:</p>
<p>&#8220;some angry bear guy bizarrely answered my data showing CBO’s 2006-2050 budget projections (which are available from CBO)duh) with an odd and completely irrelevant rant about budget deficits and surpluses between 1997-2005.&#8221;  That clearly is me and this post.  (I note&#8230; nothing that in any way relates to the other posts we&#8217;ve had on the 10 Myths.  This was the best he could do.  I also note&#8230; I forgot about his Myth #2 (The Bush tax cuts substantially reduced 2006 revenues and expanded the budget deficit.)  when writing this post, and Riedl apparently forgot about it when writing his response.  Because if 1997 to 2005 doesn&#8217;t help understand the forward projections, it sure as heck deals with today, doesn&#8217;t it?)  </p>
<p>All I can is this&#8230;  I linked to another Riedl paper showing Riedl himself doesn&#8217;t trust the CBO projects.  Fine.  I don&#8217;t either.  Riedl also tells us he corrected the data and asks us to trust his corrections to the CBO data.  We&#8217;ve had several posts up in the past few days about Riedl&#8217;s article.  We&#8217;ve noted several points where he cherrypicks data or is misleading.  (I note again &#8211; no comment about some angry bear guys doing that.)  So why the heck should I trust Riedl&#8217;s corrections without having seen them?  Because he tells us he made them?  If they&#8217;re available, why not point out where when he&#8217;s using these corrections?  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect Riedl to be back.  In his mind, no doubt, he&#8217;s answered all the questions.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/01/news/economy/minimum_wage/index.htm?cnn=yes">Senate</a> approves the increase to $7.25 by a vote of 94 to 3. Mitch McConnell takes credit for it:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is a testament to what we can accomplish when we work together to move critical legislation forward,&#8221; said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). &#8220;We look forward to working with the House of Representatives to send a final bill to the President that will be a victory for both those who earn the minimum wage and those who pay it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, you may sigh “ahem” at the news that the Republicans held out for those tax breaks, but then the joke may be on them:<br />
<blockquote>The House technically has the right to set aside any tax or budget bill that come from the Senate. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, had earlier reiterated his prerogative to &#8220;blue-slip&#8221; or set aside indefinitely such a bill coming from the Senate.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s correct. Under the Constitution, tax bills technically should start with the House. Let’s hope Rangel does take his prerogative to blue-slip these tax cuts. Something tells me that we’ll see enough Republicans caving so that it will get through the Senate. If not – the GOP has given the Democratic Party a huge issue for the 2008 elections.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Scooter Libby told investigators that he learned that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent on July 10, 2003 when a reporter told him.  But the prosecutors have three witnesses who testified that it was Scooter that told them.  One was Matt Cooper who learned this from Scooter on July 12.  But another was Ari Fleischer who learned this from Scooter at lunch on July 7.  And then there was Judy Miller who was told this not once but three times by Scooter.  The first time was on June 23, 2003.  Anyone following this trial would scoff at the notion that Scooter Libby simply forgot that he knew Valerie Plame was a CIA agent.  Anyone except <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDgzNWNkZGQ4YjY2NDZmNDczYjFiOGYyY2JiYWZiMTY=">this fellow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A witness called by prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald delivers testimony that seems clearly damaging to Libby, strongly suggesting that Libby lied when he testified before prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald’s grand jury in the CIA-leak affair. And then Libby’s lawyers take over, suggesting that the witness’s memory is so selective, or so flawed, or so sketchy as to render his or her testimony useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could it be that Byron York’s hair clouds his brain?  Or maybe he realizes his job is to excuse the actions of members of this White House even if it means spinning falsehoods into reality.  He’s been at this game of serial dishonesty ever since PlameGate became hot.  But to take the desperate queries from the defense attorneys as the gospel truth is just stupid – even for the National Review. </p>
<p>I can see it now.  Mr. York witnesses a horrific murder and the memory is seared in his brain (assuming it all gets past that hairdo of his).  The police &#8211; with his assistance &#8211; brings the culprit to trial and Mr. York shares with the jury what he saw.  At cross examination, the defense attorney asks one question: “Mr. York, what did you have for breakfast on July 14, 2003?” The witness cannot recall and the jury has to acquit.  A stupid analogy?  Well yea – but not half as stupid as the coverage of this trial from the National Review.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader NS sent me an e-mail pointing out that there is another way &#8211; kind of a holistic way &#8211; to look at Brian Riedl&#8217;s 10 Myths.   This is from NS&#8217; e-mail:</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s focusing on Brian Riedl&#8217;s analysis, fewer people are looking at the myths themselves. Riedl&#8217;s process for writing his paper went something like this.</p>
<p>Step 1. Notice a good looking data point, namely receipts as a percentage of GDP in 2006.<br />Step 2. Pull out the handbook of Heritage orthodoxy.<br />Step 3. Use the data point to bolster as many of Heritage&#8217;s core beliefs as possible. <br />Step 4. To hide the narrowness of your data, come up with a bunch of myths that the one data point can be said to dispel, that way, it looks like you are covering a lot of ground, even though you aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>How do I know this? Because many of these myths are phrased in a very precise manner so that the one data point can technically be said to dispel them, completely obscuring the larger truth. For example, let&#8217;s take the first &#8220;myth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myth 1. Tax revenues remain low.</p>
<p>Notice it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;tax revenues were lower after the tax cuts,&#8221; which is what us lefties are actually saying. It relies on the word remain. Is there really somebody saying that tax revenues remain low? How about myth 2?</p>
<p>Myth 2. The Bush tax cuts substantially reduced 2006 revenues and expanded the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Here the key is 2006. Is there really a myth going around that the Bush tax cuts specifically reduced 2006 revenues? Of course not. But if the myth was phrased more normally, a single 2006 data point couldn&#8217;t have made the case.</p>
<p>Myth 3. Supply-side economics assumes that all tax cuts immediately pay for themselves.</p>
<p>This is a two-fer&#8211;all tax cuts immediately pay for themselves. This give Reidl some wiggle room to claim that some tax cuts pay for themselves immediately or that all pay for themselves if given long enough. If he was being honest he would have phrased the myth, &#8220;Supply-side economics makes wildly optimistic assumptions about tax revenue,&#8221; but then that wouldn&#8217;t be a myth. </p>
<p>I have to skip myth 4, because it looks to me like Riedl is just wrong.</p>
<p>Myth 5. The Bush tax cuts are to blame for the projected long-term budget deficits.</p>
<p>This one is sneakier. Here the key is the word projected. The assumption is that entitlements (health care) will never be restructured, thus he can compare hypothetical health care costs that nobody thinks are sustainable with tax cuts that he would very much like to keep. If we instead compared the effects of the tax cuts to a more likely projection of future entitlement spending (say a competent government implemented a universal health care program), you would see that the tax cuts would indeed be responsible for much of the future long-term deficit.  </p>
<p>At this point Riedl shifts tactics. Instead of relying on the awkward specificity of his myths he moves on to trying to dispel the so-called myths with non-sequitors. He had to get to ten after all. </p>
<p>Why does Riedl distract us with this strained myth/fact structure? Because he has to make a lot out of one data point. It&#8217;s the only good looking one they&#8217;ve had in a while</p>

<p>Clearly, he is not qualified as he can’t even read. Speaking of lacking even the basic qualifications, when will we see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-lows-for-unemployment-jonah.html">Jonah Goldberg</a> nominate Lawrence Kudlow for the Nobel Prize in economics?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have often complained that President Bush effectively wants to embezzle the Social Security retirement benefits in order to continue his General Fund fiscal irresponsibility instituted by his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.  I have even praised conservative Congressman <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/congressmen-pence-on-taxes-and-social.html">Mike Pence</a> for objecting to this proposed embezzlement.  But it seems the National Review’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTE0YjlhNjYwYjQwNjk4MmQ0ZTc2NmQ3MzM3MjVlNGQ=">Peter Ferrara</a> wants Social Security privatization instead of tax increases:<br />
<blockquote>When I began working on the issue of Social Security, at Harvard Law School in 1978, Pete Peterson, a prominent conservative who had been secretary of Commerce under President Nixon, was arguing that the problem with the program was that the benefits were too high … My position was that if you evaluated Social<br />Security taxes and benefits in the light of market investment returns, the program was becoming a bad deal for working people. The benefits, particularly in the future, were too low, not too high. Around the same time, José Piñera started making the same argument in Chile, which enacted historic personal-account reforms in 1981. For a year he explained to Chilean television audiences how workers would get a much better deal with personal accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – Ferrara and Pence share the illusion that there is some magical free lunch where one can earn really high expected returns without incurring additional risk.  This Chilean experiment that Ferrara mentions shows his fantasies are not reality.  But Ferrara tries to argue that his fantasy beliefs have been someone vindicated by the voters who preferred Republicans.  Which is a hoot as it wasn’t the push for Social Security privatization that won the 2000 election for George W. Bush as it was the promise of more Federal spending and a large tax cut too.  But let’s return to the free lunch fantasies of Mr. Ferrara:<br />
<blockquote>It’s time for a reality check. As set out above, personal accounts will come neither through tax increases, nor cuts in future benefits. Quite to the contrary, the drift toward these politically poisonous alternatives is what has cratered the campaign for personal accounts. If blame is to be handed out, blame those who misled the president down this pain-caucus trail &#8211; they are the ones who should be held responsible for any future tax increases due to the failure of reform at the present time. The only way to achieve the goal of personal accounts is to go back to the positive and populist reform model on which George W. Bush was first elected to the Oval Office. Reformers in Washington must propose a specific personal-accounts plan that includes no tax increases or benefit cuts and presents obvious and overwhelming benefits to working people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though some conservatives argue that the Social Security Trust Fund has a long-term solvency problem, Ferrara is saying we don’t need more revenues and we don’t need to cut benefits as there is some magic fairy dust that will turn an insolvent fund into a solvent one?  How much Kool Aid has he been drinking?</p>
