                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/bill_gates_comes_to_the_coward.html#015634">Dean Baker</a> who likes to go after Washington Post editorials – comes a guest editorial from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301697.html">Bill Gates</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For centuries people assumed that economic growth resulted from the interplay between capital and labor. Today we know that these elements are outweighed by a single critical factor: innovation.  Innovation is the source of U.S. economic leadership and the foundation for our competitiveness in the global economy. Government investment in research, strong intellectual property laws and efficient capital markets are among the reasons that America has for decades been best at transforming new ideas into successful businesses. The most important factor is our workforce. Scientists and engineers trained in U.S. universities &#8211; the world&#8217;s best &#8211; have pioneered key technologies such as the microprocessor, creating industries and generating millions of high-paying jobs &#8230; Two steps are critical. First, we must demand strong schools so that young Americans enter the workforce with the math, science and problem-solving skills they need to succeed in the knowledge economy. We must also make it easier for foreign-born scientists and engineers to work for U.S. companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gates is making four policy recommendations: (1) a stronger commitment to education; (2) more government investment in research; (3) patent protection; and (4) more open borders for foreign-born scientists and engineers.  The first two strike me as good ideas and one can debate whether patent protection policies are the first best means for promoting R&#038;D.  But I’m sure the last recommendation will set Lou Dobbs off and has drawn a little fire from Dean (more on this later).  But let’s hear Mr. Gates out: <br />
<blockquote>American competitiveness also requires immigration reforms that reflect the importance of highly skilled foreign-born employees. Demand for specialized technical skills has long exceeded the supply of native-born workers with advanced degrees, and scientists and engineers from other countries fill this gap.  This issue has reached a crisis point. Computer science employment is growing by nearly 100,000 jobs annually. But at the same time studies show that there is a dramatic decline in the number of students graduating with computer science degrees. The United States provides 65,000 temporary H-1B visas each year to make up this shortfall &#8211; not nearly enough to fill open technical positions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other reason why I am so fond of Mr. Gates piece is that he argues for more H1B visas to admit highly educated workers, but then adds: &#8220;this program has strong wage protections for U.S. workers: Like other companies, Microsoft pays H-1B and U.S. employees the same high levels &#8211; levels that exceed the government&#8217;s prevailing wage.&#8221; There you have it, Bill Gates is assuring the country&#8217;s highly educated workers that they need not worry about being treated like the country&#8217;s autoworkers or dishwashers &#8211; the law will ensure that they will not have their wages depressed by foreign competition. Of course, the increased supply of foreign workers does depress wages, but is interesting that such a pillar of the IT era feels the need to assure U.S. professionals that they will not be subjected to international competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill Gates – liberal!  But hold on a second here.  If there is excess demand for these professionals, wage floors are likely irrelevant.  Isn’t the real issue that the chairman of Microsoft afraid that excess demand will drive up the wages of his R&#038;D engineers?  So increasing engineers from other countries is being called for to mitigate the rise in wages.  I don’t want to be too critical of what Mr. Gates is saying as I think it is a good idea that talent from overseas can move to Redmond, Washington or San Jose, California even if Lou Dobbs despises the idea of giving economic opportunity to anyone from abroad.  But there’s another matter to this debate, which Dean ably notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regular BTP readers know my view on this one &#8211; we make our less educated workers compete with low-paid workers in the developing world. This has benefitted highly educated workers by driving down the cost of manufactured goods, restaurant meals and other goods and services produced by low-paid workers from the developing world. International competition for the highly educated workers would lower the price of the services they produce and thereby benefit less educated workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I better stop now before anyone confuses me with Lou Dobbs.  After all, it’s breakfast time and I’ll likely enjoy a very good meal at a low price precisely because Los Angeles has always been open to our neighbors down south pursuing their best economic opportunity.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWEwYTNkMDkzYTczMGI5MWM2ZGE5NjBlZjAwOWE2YzU=">Cliff May at the NRO Corner</a> highly recommends <a href="http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&#038;id=8092">this post by &#8220;The incomparable Amir Taheri&#8221;</a>, which says, among other things&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ahmadinejad&#8217;s second assumption is that Bush is an atypical American leader who, if slapped, would not turn the other cheek. However, Bush is already a lame duck, forced to spend more energy countering domestic foes than promoting pax Americana. All that Tehran has to do is wait another year or so, in the hope that whoever succeeds Bush will be another Jimmy Carter, Bush the father, or Bill Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point of this is that American leaders tend to be wishy washy wimps. GW is not a wimp, but the next President will be, and therefore all the Iranians have to do is wait out the end of his term. And his resolve is being strengthened by &#8220;Nancy Pelosi, Jack Murtha, Barrack Obama, and other American luminaries such as Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky and Jane Fonda who would rather see Bush destroyed than the mullahs restrained.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blah blah blah whatever. We&#8217;ve all heard this before. GW&#8217;s incompetence equated with resolve, and anyone who questions the wisdom of whacking oneself over the head with a hammer labeled a traitor. </p>
<p>But I was thinking of something else when I read this&#8230; there was another President in the middle of &#8220;Jimmy Carter, Bush the father, or Bill Clinton.&#8221; And St. Ronald the Reagan in some ways behaved as the biggest weenie of them all. As an example, consider what happened when 241 American service personnel were killed in Beirut. St. Ronald&#8217;s Vice President told the world: &#8220;We will not be cowed by terrorists.&#8221; But St. Ronald was cowed by terrorists. And not long after, St. Ronald was selling weapons to the sugar daddies, trainers and backers of the folks who did the deed. </p>
<p>When it comes to the economy, as I noted in a number of posts recently, St. Ronald was the beneficiary of just about the most favorable Fed policy in the post- WW2 era, and yet, real growth, once you account for debt and population, was below that of every Democrat administration for the same period. </p>
<p>Some credit him for the fall of the USSR. And perhaps Star Wars was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, but the camel&#8217;s back was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Union-Survive-Harper-Colophon/dp/0060907320">overdue</a> for breaking. The really big expenditures that the Soviets were making &#8211; defending a vast and unpopulated border with a vast and populous China eying the empty space, keeping the helots down in Eastern Europe, and maintaining an inefficient economic system&#8230; those are apparently are mere footnotes of history compared to St. Ronald&#8217;s &#8220;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then there is the evidence we have for his patriotism. While most male Americans his age and even older were visiting Europe, North Africa, or Pacific islands during the early 1940s, Reagan&#8217;s contribution to the cause was to refuse to make more than four movies a year for fear of moving into a higher tax bracket. </p>
<p>So&#8230; what exactly is the fascination with this man? What made St. Ronald this great hero to the right?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2296829.ece">Patrick Cockburn</a> provides a good analysis of what is happening in Basra as Tony Blair decides it is time for the British to withdraw:<br />
<blockquote>The partial British military withdrawal from southern Iraq announced by Tony Blair this week follows political and military failure, and is not because of any improvement in local security, say specialists on Iraq. In a comment entitled &#8220;The British Defeat in Iraq&#8221; the pre-eminent American analyst on Iraq, Anthony Cordesman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington, asserts that British forces lost control of the situation in and around Basra by the second half of 2005. Mr Cordesman says that while the British won some tactical clashes in Basra and Maysan province in 2004, that &#8220;did not stop Islamists from taking more local political power and controlling security at the neighbourhood level when British troops were not present&#8221;. As a result, southern Iraq has, in effect, long been under the control of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) and the so-called &#8220;Sadrist&#8221; factions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dick Cheney has called the decision of Tony Blair a sign of success in Iraq.  When asked by a reporter the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070224-1.html">following</a><br />
<blockquote>Mr. Vice President, you&#8217;ve said that the British draw-down from Iraq reflects their success there and not domestic considerations. Did the United States ask for them to redeploy those troops inside Iraq to take some strain off the U.S. forces involved in the Baghdad Security Plan and in al Anbar province? And if not, why not?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Vice President does his usual bob, weave, tilt his head, babble on, and basically duck the question.  I don’t blame him given <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/cheney-attacks-pelosi-again.html">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Cheney today repeated his charge that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s approach toward the Iraq war would benefit al-Qaeda, saying that he was not trying to impugn the speaker&#8217;s patriotism but instead hold her accountable for the consequences of her policies. Continuing a feud that broke out earlier in the week, Cheney said that Democratic proposals to restrict some Iraq war funding &#8211; what he dubbed the &#8220;Pelosi policy&#8221; &#8211; would amount to a broad validation of al-Qaeda efforts to undermine America&#8217;s will to fight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blair is implementing the UK version of the Pelosi plan.  When Blair does this, it is a sign of success.  When a Democrat proposes the US version, it is a “validation of al-Qaeda efforts”.  OK, this is old news – Cheney is a hypocrite.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>If I had a nickel for every time <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022300785.html">Dick Cheney</a> contradicted himself:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Cheney today repeated his charge that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s approach toward the Iraq war would benefit al-Qaeda, saying that he was not trying to impugn the speaker&#8217;s patriotism but instead hold her accountable for the consequences of her policies. Continuing a feud that broke out earlier in the week, Cheney said that Democratic proposals to restrict some Iraq war funding &#8211; what he dubbed the &#8220;Pelosi policy&#8221; &#8211; would amount to a broad validation of al-Qaeda efforts to undermine America&#8217;s will to fight.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was that?  <strong>The Pelosi policy?</strong>  And these fools kept repeating ad nauseam that the Democrats had no policy ideas.  OK, we did but Dick Cheney can’t listen to good ideas.  It wouldn’t be prudent.  Never mind the fact that the stupid decision on 3/19/2003 was seen by Osama bin Laden as a gift from God.  Why?  It gave bin Laden American boots on the ground in a Muslim land.  But Five Deferment Dick doesn’t get that.  But we have yet to come to the real howler:<br />
<blockquote>But in a new interview with ABC television on Friday, Cheney said that patriotism had nothing to do with his comments. Instead, he charged Democrats were trying to win public support by criticizing the war without taking responsibility for the repercussions.  &#8220;She accused me of questioning her patriotism. I didn&#8217;t question her patriotism. I questioned her judgment,&#8221; Cheney said during a trip to Australia</p></blockquote>
<p>Why did we have this Axis of Evil campaign in 2002?  Oh yea – the drum up votes for the GOP.  And taking responsibility?  Dick would never do that!  Not for this chaotic and destructive war.  Not for all his partisan lies questioning the patriotism of others.  </p>
<p>But <strong>JUDGMENT</strong>?  I would not dare question the judgment of Dick Cheney as he has NONE.  </p>
<p>Of course – did you notice that big brave Dick didn’t say this to Ms. Pelosi to her face?  No, he is way over in Australia as he pops his mouth off again.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070224/ap_on_el_pr/obama2008">Barack Obama</a> has some fun with Dick Cheney’s judgment:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Now, keep in mind, this is the same guy that said we&#8217;d be greeted as liberators, the same guy that said that we&#8217;re in the last throes. I&#8217;m sure he forecast sun today,&#8221; Obama said to laughter from supporters holding campaign signs over their heads to keep dry. &#8220;When Dick Cheney says it&#8217;s a good thing, you know that you&#8217;ve probably got some big problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – it was raining.  The old joke is that economists forecast to make the weather man look good.  But there is no way to make Cheney look good.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma does us all a favor for emailing a link to <em>The Lies They Tell: How to Stop the Fox Propaganda Machine</em> by <a href="http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/48286">Don Hazen</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As presidential aspirants announce their candidacies in an already mind-numbing procession, the &#8220;Sliming Bowl&#8221; is well under way. No candidate has been smeared more than Barack Obama, and no smearer more relentless than Fox News, as the short video (right) by Brave New Films demonstrates. &#8220;Sliming&#8221; is the rabid, rapid, media barrage of persistently repeated lies and innuendo mastered by the right-wing media machine, which aims to tar candidates with negative associations before their campaigns get rolling. Or alternatively, to bruise them enough so that they will suffer under the burden of damaged goods as they try to gain footing. The conservative roots usually puts out a speculative story through Fox News or Matt Drudge (of the Drudge Report), a powerful mouthpiece for the Bush White House. Then the right-wing echo reverberates as the lies make their way to talk radio and the right-wing blogosphere. Eventually, it gets picked up and carried by the mainstream media, with few understanding where the story originated.</p></blockquote>
<p>And how does Don Hazen back up his allegation?  Simple – he has a video showing actual footage from Faux News.  Check it out.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002873.html">Max Sawicky</a> takes exception to a post from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/barney_frank_ex.html">Mark Thoma</a> on the Barney Frank v. Ben Bernanke debate.  Max has afforded us with a couple of opportunities starting with how Mark was criticizing Congressman Franks for criticizing Chairman Ben.  Criticize the criticism?  Wasn’t that the Taliban’s reaction to 9/11?</p>
<p>But back to the economics, which we also discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/washington-post-must-have-evidence-on.html">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The current Employment to Population Ratio is 63.3% and my guess has been that the natural rate is closer to 64%. Some of our conservative blogging economist friends have suggested it might be a little lower than my guess. If Chairman Ben thinks the natural rate is closer to 63.5%, then fine. But there is not a “large body of research” proving me right and him wrong nor visa versa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max’s beef with Mark is stated succinctly:<br />
<blockquote>his argument is mostly from authority. This is what economists think, Barney means well but is on the wrong page.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max backs up his claim that some economists on the same “wrong” page as the Congressmen in two ways.  First up is <a href="http://maxspeak.org/baker1.html">Dean Baker</a> on the Death of the NAIRU theory:<br />
<blockquote>Contrary to Friedman’s view, the economics profession ignored the fact that the Greenspan experiment had contradicted its longstanding views on the NAIRU. Instead, the theory was modified to allow for possibility that the NAIRU could shift unexpectedly in unpredictable ways. Hence, we see that economic theories are not discarded because they are falsified.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_monetary_plcy_economy">Jared Bernstein</a> with charts showing the gap between productivity and real compensation as well as a chart suggesting a time-varying NAIRU with the following caveat:<br />
<blockquote>Like many economists today, I consider the NAIRU to be a poor guidepost for policy makers. Events have overtaken the original model, and while some useful advances have been made (Ball and Moffitt, 2001), the evidence I present below suggests that subscribing to the model risks persistent and unnecessary slack in the economy, wasting billions of dollars and consigning millions of potential workers to fewer job opportunities and lower wages than should be the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>This debate as to what the labor market would look like if we were at full employment dates back to when Arthur Okun suggested his measure of the GNP gap over 40 years ago.  Okun suggested his infamous “law” as a proxy – not as some well accepted measure that all economists had to agree with.  To suggest there is some authority as to whether we are at full employment would be to ignore the great debate among blogging economists as to why real compensation has been so flat for so long.  I’m in the camp that we are still short of full employment, which must mean I’m on the wrong page too.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I think VisiCalc was the first killer app.  It was superseded, spreadsheet-wise, by Lotus 123, which was eventually beaten out by Excel (with its ally, vaporware).  I think Lotus is still around somewhere, but has only a small number of users.  And there are other spreadsheets around, but at present, Excel is the big boy.  Excel&#8217;s dominance is partly a matter of marketing (I alluded to vaporware, but there are other ways its been well-marketed), partly a matter of Microsoft making it work with other programs (the whole Office suite), and partly a matter momentum (at least now).  But the important thing is that software, like living creatures, evolves, and often for the same reason.</p>
<p>I was thinking of that yesterday while attending a bris.  I realized that in some ways, religions are like spreadsheet software, or any other product for that matter.  One of the reasons there are (relatively) few Jews in this world is marketing&#8230;  the biggest Jewish holiday (Yom Kippur) involves lack of eating for 24 hours.  As to big events in the life of a Jew, well, let&#8217;s just say that a bris not entirely inspirational, even when the mohel is very good.  Then there&#8217;s the whole issue of conversion &#8211; if a non-Jew wants to become a Jew, its possible, but it takes effort.</p>
<p>Christianity, at least the early version (which has become what we call Catholicism &#8211; and yes, I know I&#8217;m glossing) was set up to make converts easily.  This was done by mostly by Paul, who came around and decided that some of the rules God put out and Jesus adhered to were un-necessary (e.g., being kosher, circumcision, etc.).  Also, somewhere along the way (Paul again?) the whole communist nature (see the story of Ananias and Saphira, not to say the way Jesus and his disciples lived) of the faith disappeared.  As with kibbutzim, it served to bring in a dedicated core, but but wasn&#8217;t good for growth once that core group was achieved.  Additionally, becoming a Catholic is easy relative to becoming a Jew, and Catholics prosletyze.  One other thing&#8230;  Catholics described the rewards of Heaven, and punishment of Hell.  (For Jews, the afterlife concept seems rather nebulous.)</p>
<p>Protestant Christianity took marketing a step further.   The service was made easier to follow and more interesting, conversion was made easier, the Heaven and Hell thing has become a bit more central, etc.</p>
<p>Islam has some parallels with Protestant Christianity (the afterlife is defined much better, conversion requires only uttering the shahada, the faith actively seeks converts, etc.), as does the LDS.  (I realize the LDS considers itself Christian, but it does have a whole additional theology.)  Some of the steps these faiths have taken to attract converts sometimes backfire (again, with LDS &#8211; the practice of retroactively baptizing the dead doesn&#8217;t necessarilly lead to more living adherents, though I realize that&#8217;s not the point).  </p>
<p>But, in any case, quite ironically (at least to me) given the views of some of their proponents, religions evolve.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.  Its been pointed out that perhaps this post reads as offensive to people of faith.  Its not intentional.  My intention was to point out that over time, religions (at least those that have thrived) have become more sophisticated, adopting traits that work and losing traits that do not.  Hence, if you look at a religion as a species, there is evolution.  And I felt that was ironic because there are many people of faith who do not believe in evolution.</p>

                                <p>I have had it with the neocon nonsense.  The latest may have started with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2891738">Dick Cheney</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Cheney also had harsh words for Democratic leaders, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jack Murtha, D-Pa., who says he wants to stop the surge of more U.S. troops into Iraq. Cheney said Pelosi and other Democrats were pushing a policy in Iraq that would &#8220;validate the al Qaeda strategy.&#8221; &#8220;I think if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha are suggesting, all we&#8217;ll do is validate the al Qaeda strategy,&#8221; Cheney told ABC News.</p></blockquote>
<p>When he did, I yawned as this is standard faire for foul-mouthed, dishonest, draft dodging POS who is rich only because he defrauded the shareholders of Halliburton with Andersen’s assistance and he milked the defense procurement “rules” he designed as DoD secretary (incidentally, why would one choose a draft dodger to run the Defense Department).  But the bully didn’t expect a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=47">Madame Speaker</a> to hit back:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Cheney continues to question the patriotism of those of us in Congress who challenge the Bush Administration’s misguided policies in Iraq, but his latest attack is beneath the office of the Vice President, especially at a time of war. Mischaracterizations by the Vice President will not dissuade Congress from developing, on a bipartisan basis, a responsible new direction for U.S. policy in Iraq that brings our troops home safely and soon. I hope the President will repudiate and distance himself from the Vice President’s remarks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!  Given that Five Deferment Dick is a coward, he needed some help from the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/22/cheney-attacks-murtha">White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino</a><br />
<blockquote>QUESTION: Was he at all out of line in making those comments?<br />PERINO: The Vice President out of line? Absolutely not.  He was questioning the merits of the &#8211; of their proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the sexist line – but President Bush has to send one woman out as another woman was standing up to the lying POS we have to endure as Vice President.  While that’s pathetic enough (I guess we now know why Vietnam Vets never wanted to serve side by side with the coward known as Dick Cheney).  But think about the phrase “merits” as in the merits of the stupidest decision ever made – the one on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq.  Two things are clear – Al Qaeda was revived. And Iran is king of the hill in the Middle East.  I would suspect most Americans would think of Al Qaeda is an enemy and this Iranian government is not exactly the ally of most rational Americans.  And yet, George W. Bush has given both a huge upper hand in accomplishing their goals.  Am I questioning the patriotism of George W. Bush?  Am I calling him a traitor?  OK, I’m not using the weasel words of Dana Perino.  I am questioning the patriotism of that terrorist we have to endure as President for the next couple of years. </p>
<p><strong>Memo to Dick Cheney</strong>: next time Nancy Pelosi comes after you, might I suggest standing behind the skirts of a gal who knows how to <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">fight</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Angry Bear is not one of the big blogs.  Sure, as one of the writers for Angry Bear, I’d love the ego boost of seeing the blog climb into the stratosphere of blogdom, but its not going to happen.  We focus too much on Economics, which everyone knows is boring, and even among the boring Economics blogs, there are others that are more popular.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/iraq-it-gets-worse.html">trackback</a> in one of my posts.  It wasn’t a great post, nor even about economics… just referencing an article about how some National Guard units were short on rifles, mortars, and howitzers.  Anyway, the trackback led to <a href="http://morethanloans.blogspot.com/2007/02/rifles-and-nonsense.html">this post</a> at a blog called “More than Loans.”  </p>
<p>The blogger was criticizing me as an example of the lefties looking for a way to criticize the administration for sending troops into harm’s way with inadequate equipment.  OK.  Guilty as charged.  Now that I’m outed, I guess I have to admit that:</p>
<p>1.  I understand that soldiers really have enough equipment.  Its all sitting in Iraq, greased (when appropriate), wrapped and accounted for.  So the fact that soldiers are training with rifles when they’re going to use carbines in Iraq is no big deal.  (I assume they&#8217;re at least training with rifles.)  Its especially not a big deal for the soldiers that will be deployed in the surge in urban areas, such as Sadr City.  After all, what difference is there between a rifle and a carbine after all when it comes to house to house fighting?<br />2.  I understand that rifles and carbines are left behind in Iraq rather than shipped back with the soldiers to whom they were assigned because of concerns about weight.  <br />3.  I understand that there are more than enough soldiers.  The military is turning away recruits because so many patriotic Americans are leaping at the chance to go fight off Iraqi insurgents.  I understand that the National Guard troops being sent to Iraq for the second time (or is it third) volunteered to be there.  They signed up fully expecting to go to Iraq, insisting that they really would rather perform the typical National Guard-type duties.  (And who wouldn’t?  If only those National Guard types didn’t hog all the good spots there’d be room for some of the more patriotic folk to go to the sandbox.) <br />4.  I understand that there are more than enough allies.  And the British drawdown demonstrates yet again that we’re winning.  <br />5.  I understand that there is no history of ethnic strife in Iraq.  A few dead enders and a few foreign Al Qaeda types are causing the problems.<br />6.  I understand that the media still refuses to show pictures or the schoolhouses being painted – if they did, the American public would understand that we’re winning.  <br />7.  I understand that catching Osama is irrelevant.  I understand that if he is ever caught, it won’t be irrelevant then.<br />8.  I understand that the resurgence of the Taliban is irrelevant.<br />9.  I understand that Pakistan is our ally.  And so is Saudi Arabia.  <br />10.  I understand Iraq had everything to do with 9/11. <br />11.  I understand American troops are well taken care of when they’re wounded.<br />12.  I understand Bush has a plan.  And its going to work.  Like his other plans.</p>
<p>I can’t end with 12… so here’s lucky number 13…</p>
<p>13.  I understand that its my fault.  </p>
<p>What I don’t understand is something else on the “More than Loans” site.  He has a little logo with a plane and a flag and the words “I am pro-victory.”  I don’t understand what that means.  I don’t know what victory in Iraq means at this point.  And I wonder how that attitude differs from what the rest of us think or want.  (Are the rest of us for defeat?  Or a violent and warlike Iraq?)  And I wonder what actions differentiate those who are pro-victory from those who are not.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall that the Ex-Girlfriend is addicted to Starbucks espresso.  (Everybody needs a character flaw.)  Anyway, we got an espresso-maker as a wedding gift, and this morning she was puttering around the kitchen making noises for a while, and then the espresso-maker started doing the same.  Eventually, it spit out some black liquid made with beans purchased at Trader Joe&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Ex-Girlfriend pronounced the coffee inadequate &#8211; &#8220;not as good as Starbucks.&#8221;  Since it was her first time doing it, the process was repeated:  Ex-Girlfriend made noises, espresso-maker made noises, liquid was expelled, and liquid was pronounced undrinkable.  </p>
<p>As I write, the Ex-Girlfriend is putting on shoes and is about to head to Starbucks.  She asked me to convey some questions&#8230;.</p>
<p>If she were to ask the Starbucks folks what blend they use, would they tell her?  Do they sell that precise blend, or do the blends they sell differ from the ones they actually use?  Can readers recommend a blend that would taste good to someone whose taste buds are defective enough to enjoy Starbucks?</p>
