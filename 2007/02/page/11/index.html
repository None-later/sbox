                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/">recent post by Dean Baker</a>  made me think about this question – If the routine complaint that “the government has spent the Social Security Trust Fund Surplus” is inverted to ask what would it mean if the government “saved” it instead, what would that mean?</p>
<p>First, lets recap what Dean said in his post – The trust fund uses its surplus to buy Treasury bonds which are specially designated for that purpose.  That is, they don’t just go to the market and buy garden variety T-bonds but get ones that are in all respects the same except that they cant be traded on the secondary market.  What has the government done with the proceeds of these SS bonds?  If we assume that the SS bonds are the marginal debt issued in each year then in every year except the brief period around 2000 when the budget was in surplus they spent the money.  During the brief surplus period they used the money to reduce the national debt.
</p>
<p>Suppose they had saved the money instead.  They could have done any of several things.  One is that they could have put the money in a savings account (which would mean that the bank involved would then invest the money in stocks, bonds, loans, or some other asset).  Another is that they could have bought some stock.  Another is that they could have bought some bonds.  But if they had done any of these things there would be no reason to buy Treasury bonds at all – The Social Security Trust Fund could just as easily buy any of these assets directly on their own account without using the government as an intermediary.</p>
<p>But it was clearly thought that using the Federal Government as an intermediary was preferable to any of these alternatives.  And it is also worth emphasizing that there was no ex ante expectation as to what the government would do with money – indeed, we have had both surplus and deficit years since 1983 without causing any trouble to the Trust Fund.  Why was using the Federal Government as an intermediary preferred?
</p>
<p>There is one reason and one reason only – Treasury bonds are the nearest thing to a risk free asset that could be imagined in 1983.  What the money was spent on was irrelevant.  The key is that regardless of future economic events, the one entity that could be counted on to honor its debts was the Federal Government.    THAT is why the SS bonds are specially designated – not to protect the Federal Government from having to pay them off, but to protect the SS beneficiaries from any attempt to invest the surplus in something less rock-solid than T-bonds.</p>
<p>So, any complaint about the Federal Government “spending the surplus” is in reality an argument against the profligate debt accumulation strategy of the past 6 years.  This affects the SS system only insofar as it erodes the status of T-bonds as a risk free asset,   something that nobody could even imagine wondering about 25 years ago.  If the Federal Government had been running itself on as sound an actuarial basis as the Social Security Administration does it would still be unthinkable.  That it isnt is a testimony to the lunacy of our fiscal policy, but is in no way an argument for Social Security “reform”.</p>

                                <p>It would seem that <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=020607C">TCSDaily</a> has dusted off the old Keynesian canard that only fiscal policy matters:<br />
<blockquote>Now you don&#8217;t have to be an acolyte of supply-side guru Arthur Laffer to find that sort of &#8220;static analysis&#8221; a little weird. Most Americans probably would. So, apparently, did the economic team at Goldman Sachs, the old employer of Robert Rubin, President Bill Clinton&#8217;s second treasury secretary. Thus the firm&#8217;s econ wonks decided to try and simulate the real-world effect of letting the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. Using the respected Washington University Macro Model, Goldman reset the tax code to its pre-Bush status, assumed all tax cuts expired, and watched how the economy reacted as 2011 began. What did the firm see? Well, in the first quarter of 2011 the economy dropped 3 percentage points below what it would have been otherwise. &#8220;Absent a tailwind to growth from some other source,&#8221; the analysis concludes, &#8220;this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession.&#8221;  So actually it&#8217;s CBO&#8217;s economic forecast, not Bush&#8217;s, that is overly optimistic about future economic growth. But wouldn&#8217;t the Federal Reserve jump in and cut interest rates, offsetting the fiscal drag of the tax hikes with easy monetary policy? The Goldman Sachs experiment assumes it would, but WUMM still shows the economy sinking: &#8220;In an effort to resuscitate demand, the Fed immediately cuts the federal funds rate, bringing it 250 basis points below the status quo level over the next year and one-half &#8230; Despite this, output growth remains well below trend over that period, putting downward pressure on inflation as slack in the economy increases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me get this straight.  If we restore fiscal responsibility, national savings will rise which must mean that we get a recession.  Lower interest rates cannot raise investment enough to maintain full employment.  The currency will not devalue enough so as to increase net exports sufficiently.  I’m sorry but I’m not buying this outdated version of the Keynesian model.  Why?  Didn’t we try an experiment like this in 1993?  Might Mr. Pethokoukis provide us with the evidence that we had a Bill Clinton recession since he is predicting the Hillary Clinton recession?</p>

                                <p>As a follow-up to my comments on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/tim-worstall-on-stopler-samuelson-meet.html">Tim Worstell</a> argument that free trade is the cause of declining global income inequality, let me cite a couple of things.  First up is the work of <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/htm/index2007_chap1.cfm">Xavier Sala-i-Martin</a> which Tim alludes to.  While it is true that Sala-i-Martin has been noting a decline in global inequality, he attributes this decline to the convergence hypothesis, which he and Robert Barro discuss in their 1992 Journal of Political Economy paper.  Simply put – as capital per capita rise in the poorer nations rise, their per capita income also rise.  This, of course, is the Solow growth model argument.  </p>
<p>But does the factor price equalization theorem has any role to play?  <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282%28199705%2987%3A2%3C194%3APCICAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S&#038;size=LARGE">Matthew J.

                                <p>Every so often, there&#8217;s something useful in the NRO.  Today was such a day.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2QxMjc5Zjg5NGRlMzViODU4MWI0YmUyM2Q5OTI3NzA=">John J. Miller</a>, not one of the better known denizens of the Corner had a post </p>
<p>
<blockquote>February 28, 2001: “In his first address to Congress, Bush likened his $ 1.9 trillion budget to a family budget&#8230;”</p>
<p>February 5, 2002: “President Bush yesterday proposed a $ 2.13 trillion budget for next year&#8230;”</p>
<p>February 4, 2003: “President Bush announced a $ 2.23 trillion budget for fiscal 2004 yesterday&#8230;”</p>
<p>February 3, 2004: “President Bush sent Congress a $2.4 trillion spending plan yesterday&#8230;”</p>
<p>February 13, 2005: “President Bush sent Congress a $2.57 trillion budget&#8230;”</p>
<p>February 5, 2006: “President Bush plans to propose a $2.7 trillion budget tomorrow&#8230;”</p>
<p>Today: “President Bush took aim yesterday at domestic spending as part of a plan to balance the budget in five years without raising taxes while increasing funding for the Iraq war and permanently expanding the military. With the $2.9 trillion budget he submitted to Congress&#8230;”</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re keeping score at home, $1.9 trillion to $2.9 trillion is an increase of more than 52 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, he doesn&#8217;t provide sources for his quotes, but they look about right to me.  What he should have also mentioned was inflation&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl">According to the BLS inflation calculator</a>, inflation from 2001 to 2006 was 13.83%.  No doubt by 2008, when GW&#8217;s latest budget applies, it will be a bit higher.  But any way one slices it, small government George has been increasing spending a heck of a lot faster inflation.</p>

                                <p>Yesterday, I had <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/riedls-myth-8-part.html">a post</a> on Brian Riedl’s <a href="http://www.heritage.org/About/Departments/trustees.cfm">Myth 8</a>, which reads: </p>
<p>“Myth #8: Tax cuts help the economy by &#8220;putting money in people&#8217;s pockets.&#8221;<br />Fact: Pro-growth tax cuts support incentives for productive behavior.”</p>
<p>In the post, I showed that the data since the Reagan administration simply doesn’t Riedl’s fact, unless tax cuts are not pro-growth, or Americans insist on behaving in ways that counter whatever incentives are thrown at them.  I note that I have looked at this issue before, as has PGL, sometimes using longer data sets, sometimes using state data, and so forth.  </p>
<p>Myth 8, or rather the fact that Riedl puts forth, is popular among conservatives so I thought I’d write a post about the storyline itself.  </p>
<p>I will start by noting that I couldn’t tell you what life is like, on a daily basis, for folks like Richard Scaife, Holland Coors, Steve Forbes, Holland Coors, and the other <a href="http://www.heritage.org/About/Departments/trustees.cfm">Heritage Trustees </a>.  This is not to imply they’re bad people or idiots or anything of the sort.  It is to say that my situation is very far removed from theirs, probably farther removed than the situation facing a Central Asian peasant, so in some ways, a Central Asian peasant and I would have an easier time understanding each other than, say, Steve Forbes and I.  (I will stick to Steve Forbes in this essay, largely because I’ve actually heard him speak on taxes, whereas I haven’t, um, enjoyed the privilege with the Heritage Trustees.)  Which means – just as I don’t claim to understand Steve Forbes, my guess is he doesn’t understand the vast majority of Americans whose situation much more closely resembles mine than his.</p>
<p>Since the Trustees are the ones in charge at Heritage, and since they are at the top of the business world (however it is that they got there – no doubt some of them consider themselves entrepeneurs), it is easy to assume that the way they do business applies to everyone else in America, or would, if only they were smart enough to be at the top of the business world too.  So I figured I’d try, as best I could, to put myself in the shoes of folks like that.  And it occurs to me that perhaps the fact Riedl cites might actually apply to Steve Forbes in some way. </p>
<p>See, Steve Forbes might actually pay a little bit of attention to taxes when he’s making a business decision.  My guess is, if it happens, its in the lines of telling some underling to move money from some investment vehicle in low tax jurisdiction A to low tax jurisdiction B.  Another way I would imagine (and imagining this is not difficult for me – regular readers may recall I worked at one of the big accounting firms doing transfer pricing for the worst year of my life) folks like Mr. Forbes taking into account tax rules is by setting up pass through corporations in some low tax jurisdictions and claim that’s where you’re actually doing business.  (According to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6905/11-30-Cross-BorderInvestment.pdf">CBO </a>  20% of the returns on investment abroad by US companies from 1993 – 2003 came from Ireland and Bermuda.  Ireland and Bermuda.  If there’s some way to explain that 20% of the returns of all American companies abroad came from Ireland and Bermuda without invoking tax fraud on a massive scale, I’d love to hear it.)  </p>
<p>But let’s leave out “business decisions” that are nothing more than accounting gimmicks and focus on activities that Adam Smith might have recognized as productive.  In other words, activities that increase the size of the pie, rather than ways to free ride upon a system paid for by others.  Let us say that Mr. Forbes thought up a way to make some highly desirable product (what would be the current day analog of Adam Smith’s pins?) at a small fraction of the cost they cost anyone else to make.  Would GW era top marginal income tax rates of 35% really be more likely to get Mr. Forbes to pick up the phone and tell one of his subordinates to put the business plan in motion?  Perhaps the gain to an extra few tens of millions is minor to a guy like Steve Forbes but the costs of picking up the phone are not high either.  A 45 percent difference in his tax rate (and here I’m assuming his accountants are incompetent) shouldn’t make a difference.</p>
<p>The rest of us also don’t function that way.  When I left the corporate world to start my business, I had big dreams, but I didn’t have big expectations.  In fact, I didn’t expect to make what I was making in the corporate world.  (And I haven’t so far!)  What I was looking for was to be my own boss.  Most of my friends also have their own businesses.  And guess what – not a one of them, not the ones that have been successful and not the ones that have been unsuccessful, took marginal tax rates into account when looking to start their business.  That’s now the way its done.  </p>
<p>But its not just entrepreneurs, or people who consider themselves entrepreneurs…  Was someone less likely to take a position as head of a Fortune 500 company in 1993 because the marginal tax rates rose from 31% to 39%?  Seriously?  What about a position as a mid-level manager, or a janitor?</p>
<p>Now, at extremely high rates, perhaps there’s something to it.  Reagan used to love to tell the story of how he made only 4 movies a year – if he made a fifth, it would put him in a 91% tax bracket, and it wouldn’t pay.  Now, this was during WW2, and the country was fighting for its survival.  (As an aside, my grandfather, who was older than Reagan, and had two kids, and thus was completely exempt from the draft never cut back on hours he worked during the war.  While Reagan was patriotically bitching about his tax rates, my grandfather was apparently unpatriotically touring Western Europe in a Sherman.  Come to think of it, we have a similar situation going now.  Or perhaps it has – maybe when Ledeen complains about <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTYxZDcxMzkzNzhiMzFkNTAwMzkxNjE0Y2FkNmM0MTE=">American troops “sitting in air-conditioned quarters and drinking designer coffee”</a>, he should in fact give praise that the troops are behaving more like Reagan than my grandfather and his buddies.)  </p>
<p>In the end, as I noted in my previous post, the story told by guys like Forbes is very attractive.  There’s a big free lunch in it – pay less and get more.  But its wrong as we’ve seen when we looked at data in post after post.  The world doesn’t work that way, at least for the range of taxes we’ve observed in recent decades in the US.  In fact, when these “pro-growth” policies get enacted, we end up with slower growth.  Its OK for a guy like Steve Forbes – where he’s at, its hard to lose whatever happens.  But the fact that he’s advocating that he should be allowed to both decrease the rate of increase in the collective pie, and to take a larger slice at the same time, should be concerning to the rest of us.</p>

<blockquote>The Issue: President Bush has managed to wage a war, cut taxes and boost other spending without triggering Vietnam-era inflation.</p>
<p>The Background: The spending spree has been aided by foreign borrowing and a strong economy.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Next: While economically painless so far, war and military spending will soon collide with looming entitlement obligations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lord – her article starts off as one of those stupid memos from the attorney types who I have to work with. But the comparison is obvious from the start.  LBJ’s triple-whammy of tax cuts with more defense spending and more entitlements was bad, bad while Bush43’s version of the same fiscal irresponsibility was good, good.  Solomon does not bother to inform the readers of the Wall Street Journal of two important facts: (1) the economy in 1966 was at full employment while the economy in 2003 was not; and (2) the FED increased interest rates in reaction of Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility.  But the rest of this reads like Karl Rove wrote it himself:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s Mr. Bush&#8217;s secret? Ingredient one: strong revenue growth driven by an economy distinguished by surging profits and rising incomes at the top, which are taxed more heavily than incomes at the bottom. Ingredient two: tax cuts and spending increases, which arrived when the U.S. economy needed a boost. Ingredient three, and perhaps the most significant: the willingness of foreigners to lend to the U.S., which finances the budget deficit without pushing up interest rates at a time when Americans don&#8217;t save very much.</p></blockquote>
<p>She continues by talking about Bush’s latest budget with a graph that was alerted to us by a comment under a post by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010685.php">Kevin Drum</a>.  Kevin and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/general-schoomaker-on-defense-spending.html">this Angrybear</a> noted that defense spending currently is near 5% of GDP.  But that’s not what the graph provided by Ms. Soloman displays.  So let’s ask her and the Wall Street Journal provided them with this factually inaccurate diagram?  And why did they publish such an incredibly flawed article?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=020507B">Tim Worstall</a> suggests that free trade will naturally lead to rising income inequality in the U.S., but we really should see this as a good thing:<br />
<blockquote>The theory is the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem. Stripped to its essentials this says that we would expect the process of globalization to have the following effect: it will lower wages in the US and raise corporate profits (more precisely, returns to capital). In the poor countries that the US is trading with it will have the opposite effect</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, workers in the U.S. make more than workers in places like China and Mexico because the U.S. has a higher capital to labor ratio.  Free trade will tend to equalize wages internationally, which means Mexican and Chinese wages will rise as U.S. wages will fall.  It’s called the <a href="http://internationalecon.com/v1.0/ch60/60c170.html">Factor Price Equalization</a> theorem:<br />
<blockquote>The fourth major theorem that arises out of the Heckscher-Ohlin model is called the factor-price equalization theorem. Simply stated the theorem says that when the prices of the output goods are equalized between countries as they move to free trade, then the prices of the factors (capital and labor) will also be equalized between countries. This implies that free trade will equalize the wages of workers and the rents earned on capital throughout the world. The theorem derives from the assumptions of the model, the most critical of which is the assumption that the two countries share the same production technology and that markets are perfectly competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Worstall is relying on a very simple two-good, two-factor of production theorem where all workers are homogenous.  He is seemingly unaware of the <a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/leo.htm">Leontiff Paradox</a>.  <br />
<blockquote>Leontief reached a paradoxical conclusion that the US &#8211; the most capital abundant country in the world by any criterion &#8211; exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital- intensive commodities. This result has come to be known as the Leontief Paradox. Leontief took the profession by surprise and stimulated an enormous amount of empirical and theoretical research on the subject.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/02/morality-of-rising-inequality.html">Greg Mankiw</a> seemed to enjoy Worstall’s post.  While I also found it interesting, I would hope that the economics students at Harvard go well beyond the Heckscher-Ohlin model when they take international economics.  Especially when Worstall and Mankiw use an oversimplified model of international trade to talk about morality.  I’m sorry fellows, but I’d rather listen to my preacher when it comes to questions of morality.</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, Brad deLong style&#8230;  On a recent thread, Walter Jeffries wrote:</p>
<p>Realize that the vast majority of farmers do not get subsidies. The subsidies go to the big guys who have the hired guns that jump their paperwork through the hoops that were specifically designed for them.</p>
<p>We also don&#8217;t need farm subsidies. We need a reasonable environment and economy that encourages farming and individual self-sufficiency. I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;survivalism&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about people having gardens, chickens, a summer pig, etc. What has happened with urbanization is that people have become too disconnected from their sources of food.</p>
<p>One problem with the subsidies is the hurt the unsubsidized farmers like myself. Big-ag can devote the dollars and hired guns to get their “share” of the subsidies racking up big profits from them. Small and Micro-farmers, who are your local producers selling at farmers market and direct to consumers, are then faced with fighting against a subsidized product in the market place. I say eliminate all of the subsidies.</p>
<p>However, there is another issue that hurts small farmers even more and that is the real estate valuation and over taxation. That’s turning cropland into condos at an ever increasing rate. Pretty soon you’ll have plentiful places to live but nothing to eat.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>cactus here again&#8230;  I&#8217;m completely ignorant of agricultural policy.  Acknowledging that upfront, what little I know biases me toward agreeing with paragraph 1, the first half paragraph 2, and pragraph 3.  I&#8217;d be interested in knowing more about the taxes on farms &#8211; what makes them onerous (or not)?  I as also wondering about who gets the subsidies.  Is there something else those of us with zero knowledge should know to form a reasonable opinion?</p>

                                <p>Riedl Myth 8</p>
<p>Continuing the look at <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm">Brian Riedl’s ten myths</a>, we get to Myth 8.</p>
<p>“Myth #8: Tax cuts help the economy by &#8220;putting money in people&#8217;s pockets.&#8221;<br />Fact: Pro-growth tax cuts support incentives for productive behavior.”</p>
<p>The more I look at this one, the more important it seems to me, so I’d like to devote two posts to it.  In this post, I’m going to look at numbers and show that Riedl is simply wrong about what tax cuts do.  (Unless, of course, one assumes that collectively Americans are nuts.)  In the next day or two, I will provide reasons why the data doesn’t show what Riedl expects it to show.</p>
<p>Let’s see whether “pro-growth tax cuts” are “pro-growth” – let’s see whether they cause people to behave in a productive fashion.  Two ways come to mind:</p>
<p>1.  See how tax rates correlate with changes in real GDP per capita<br />2.  See how tax rates correlate with changes in unemployment</p>
<p>The first one is a no-brainer.  We all know real GDP per capita was faster in the 50s and 60s when the tax rates were much higher than it is now.  The growth rate in real GDP per capita from 1950 to 1980 was about 2.57% per year, while from 1980 to 2005 it was only 1.93%.  </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita data used in this post is annual data obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  Regular readers will also recall I’ve already had a post showing that going back to 1950, there is a slight <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/tax-rates-over-time-gdp-growth-rates.html">positive correlation between tax rates and real GDP per capita growth rates</a>.  </p>
<p>But let’s assume that perhaps something changed around 1980.  Reagan ushered in a new era, after all.  </p>
<p>So… what does the correlation look like between growth rates in real GDP per capita and tax rates?  Table 1 looks at the correlation between the lowest <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:rpTZ9bpfAUgJ:www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf+marginal+tax+rates+historical+irs.gov&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=1&#038;gl=us">marginal tax rates</a> and the growth rate in real GDP per capita for the period from 1981 to 2005, for the period from 1982 to 2005, etc., through 1992 to 2005.  (I wanted to ensure at least two presidencies got included)  It also shows the correlation between the highest marginal tax rate and the growth rate in real GDP per capita for the same periods.  At the very least, we can say that the correlation between tax rates and growth in real GDP per capita does not appear to be negative, and it doesn’t seem a stretch to say the correlations are positive.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is with employment.  Presumably, if Riedl is correct, cutting taxes creates incentives – so people are more likely to hire more workers, and more people are likely to be willing to get jobs.  Presumably, if the incentives are right, even retirees will come back to work.  </p>
<p>Table 2 is similar to Table 1, except instead of looking at growth rate in real GDP per capita, it looks at average yearly <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm#a1.f.1">labor force participation rates</a>.  Once again, I’m not sure how the data can be interpreted in such a way as to support Riedl’s story.  </p>
<p>Which brings me back to a point I’ve made before.  The tax cutting story sounds plausible, and its one that we’d all like to believe because there’s a free lunch in it.  (I.e., cut taxes and things get better.)  The problem is that it doesn’t match known facts in the US since WW2.  (Long time readers know I’ve looked at this many times and many ways.)  It might be fine for Slovenia’s transition from “Communism” to “Capitalism” but it sure as heck doesn’t apply here – and it might not be the best model for Slovenia either.  </p>
<p>In the next day or two, I’ll have a post in the next day or two explaining what I think is wrong with the theory and why it doesn’t match the data.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, if anyone wants my spreadsheets, just drop me a line.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjA5NDE3MzI0ZmYyNmE4Mzc5OWNmYWUwMmIwZjllNTE=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> dons his Bush cheerleader suit again.  A few of his claims follows:<br />
<blockquote>Prior to this triumphant return, Bush delivered a major economic speech that touted his plan for a balanced budget at the prevailing low tax rates &#8211; a plan geared to extend the economic boom that began in 2003 &#8230; It’s about time more people start giving Bush credit for today’s strong economy. That’s right &#8211; it’s the greatest story never told. Just look at some of the latest numbers.  Real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2006 came in at 3.5 percent at an annual rate. Price inflation inside the report was very low, around 2 percent, with one major price gauge actually dropping its greatest amount in fifty-two years. For the whole of 2006, GDP advanced 3.4 percent. This followed increases of 3.2 percent in 2005, 3.4 percent in 2004, and 3.7 percent in 2003. The latest jobs numbers tell the same story. The most accurate employment gauge, called “adjusted households” (which the Bureau of Labor Statistics created in order to combine the non-farm payroll survey with the civilian-employment household survey), shows nearly 3 million new jobs annually over the past three years &#8211; all since Mr. Bush’s supply-side tax cuts of 2003.  And the president (or anybody else) shouldn’t fret about so-called wage stagnation, or inequality. Hourly earnings for non-supervisory wage earners averaged $16.76 in 2006, a near 20 percent gain from the last business-cycle peak in 2000 and a 64 percent increase from the $10.20 cycle peak in 1990.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow keeps saying no one is talking about the alleged Bush boom with his “greatest story never told” but that’s all Kudlow seems to be doing.  Maybe he’s worried that no one is listening to him.  And why should anyone?  He talks about the increase in NOMINAL wages as if that were the same thing as an increase in real wages.  And he talks about how the economy has improved in terms of employment growth and the growth rates since late 2003 – forgetting to tell folks that real GDP growth since 2000 has been anemic and that employment FELL from early 2001 to mid-2003.  </p>
<p>But let’s take the growth in wages from the end of 2003 to the end of 2006.  For average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, nominal wages rose by about 10.2% but most of that increase was merely to cover the cost of living.  Real wages rose by only 0.6%.  Since I trust Kudlow is not stupid enough not to know about the difference between nominal versus real changes, one has to wonder why he assumes his readers are and why he continues to lie to them.  </p>
<p>Kudlow later decides to attribute this alleged Bush boom to reductions in tax rates on capital income as if we were witnessing an investment led boom.  Funny he forgot to tell us what happened to investment demand during the latest quarter.  I was if that is because investment demand fell?  </p>
<p>But the greatest whopper that Kudlow told had to do with balancing the budget “at the prevailing low tax rates”.  The only projections that show a balanced UNIFIED deficit by 2012 are the ones that assume that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire and are not extended.  This is what Kudlow means by prevailing low tax rates.  So it seems he must believe that the tax rates under Bill Clinton were low.</p>
