                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Let me start with the usual dipshit analysis from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODliMjBjZWZjYjRiNzU2MzZkNzhjZDNhOWVhZDE3NTY=">Byron York</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What do Bob Woodward, Robert Novak, Walter Pincus, David Sanger, Glenn Kessler, and Evan Thomas have in common? &#8230; each heard nothing from Libby about Valerie Plame Wilson.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah Byron – that’s why the defense called them as witnesses.  DUH!  Now, let’s talk about Ari Fleischer and Judy Miller.  What do they have in common besides being witnesses for the prosecution?  Oh yea, Scooter told them about Valerie Plame Wilson.  Of course, that’s not the real reason that this is dipshit analysis.  Let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010740.php">Kevin Drum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Who cares? Libby&#8217;s not on trial for outing Plame&#8217;s identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Kevin, but let him keep talking as he has something more fundamental to ask:<br />
<blockquote>So here&#8217;s a more pointed question. As near as I can tell, everyone else that prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald talked to during the course of his investigation told him the truth. That includes Richard Armitage, who originally leaked Plame&#8217;s name to Robert Novak. It also appears to include Karl Rove (though only barely), Bob Woodward, Ari Fleischer, Novak himself, and dozens of others. So here&#8217;s my question: If everyone else told the truth, why did Libby lie? Repeatedly. Under oath. What was different about the vice president&#8217;s office that out of the entire mountain of people Fitzgerald interviewed, Dick Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff was the only one who felt he had to lie?</p></blockquote>
<p>You know – Byron York’s incessant manure sometimes pays dividends.  It gets reasonable people like Kevin Drum probing even deeper into the mess known as PlameGate.  The National Review apologists for the liars in the White House want us to believe this is no more than lying about adultery – or something like that (except adultery seems to be an impeachable offense).  No, no, no, no – the REASON Libby perjured himself was to protect Dick Cheney.  One has to wonder – from what?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well, it was the intent of <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070212/windfall_profits_tax_some_mode.htm">James Pethokoukis</a> to do the usual Carter bashing as he tried to trash something Senator Clinton said:<br />
<blockquote>How about a windfall profits tax on Google? It&#8217;s an idea that came to me after watching a video of Sen. Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s winter wing-ding, apparently call for the confiscation of oil company profits. As the front-runner for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination put it: “The other day the oil companies reported the highest profits in the history of the world. I want to take those profits, and I want to put them into a strategic energy fund that will begin to fund alternative smart energy &#8230; technologies that will begin to actually move us toward the direction of independence.” Why stop there? Why not confiscate a portion of Google&#8217;s fat annual profits–the company&#8217;s 2006 earnings were some $3 billion on revenue of $10.6 billion &#8211; and use it for some relevant national goal? &#8230; The thing, though, is that these targeted taxes don&#8217;t have a great track record. Look at what happened when oil companies were hit with the windfall profit tax that President Carter signed into law in 1980. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, as recently unearthed by the Tax Foundation, the windfall profits tax–a real bear to administer–had two nasty side effects: 1) It didn&#8217;t raise as much money as forecast. Instead of raising $320 billion between 1980 and 1989, it raised only about $40 billion; 2) the CRS determined that the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 to 6 percent. So the United States had to import more oil than it otherwise would have.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tax Foundation document can be found <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1168.html">here</a>.  But let’s review both of these claims.  First, the shortfall in revenues was not due to a decline in production but due to a decline in prices.  Does Mr. Pethokoukis and the Tax Foundation think inward shifts of the supply side lower prices?  Or do they realize that OPEC raised its production during the 1980’s?  But let’s accept the second premise and turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/did_jimmy_carters_oil_windfall.html#015474">Dean Baker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Well, if U.S. production was reduced by 3 to 6 percent for 5 years, this would have lowered total output by between 500 million and 1 billion barrels over this period. (This assumes annual domestic production of about 3.3 billion barrels a year.) Of course, if we didn&#8217;t pump the oil out of the ground back in the late 70s and early 80s, that means it is still in the ground available for future use. That sounds good to me. The other major indictment of the tax was that it raised much less revenue than had been projected. The key to this part of the story was that oil prices collapsed in 1982. I&#8217;m not sure that anyone wants to attribute this collapse to the windfall profit tax (higher prices means reduced demand), but if that&#8217;s the claim, I&#8217;m not sure that many people would have been upset with the outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crticizing President Carter for his price controls is one thing, but when this crowd bashes his profits tax using these stale arguments, they show they know nothing about either the facts or basic economics.</p>

                                <p>This post is by reader Stormy.  I would remind the reader that I don&#8217;t necesarilly agree with readers when I post their write-ups; I will post material that I think is well written and reasonably well thought out, especially if I think it will spur discussion or make people think.  I am also happy to post material on topics that I don&#8217;t know much about &#8211; the workings of the WTO and global warming certainly qualify.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s Stormy:<br />____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> IPCC Report and the WTO</p>
<p>It is time for the WTO and economists, to take seriously the issues of global warming, environmental decay, and the depletion of resources.  Most of us by now are familiar with the conservative IPCC report and its dire predictions for the coming centuries.  Even <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/06/news/FIN-GEN-Egypt-Volcker-Global-Warming.php">Paul Volcker</a> has stepped forward, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“First of all, I don’t think (such a step) is going to have much of an impact on the economy overall.  Second of all, if you don’t do it, you can be sure that the economy will go down the drain in the next 30 years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The IPCC report is only a small part of the iceberg leisurely cruising our way.  For example, a recent study in the journal <i>Science</i> concluded that, if we continue are present rapacious appetites, fish stocks will crash by 2048.  The decline of diversity is accelerating worldwide.  Extrapolating that trend into the future, the authors find that all species presently fished will collapse by the year 2048.  To date, there has been no substantive rebuttal to this peer-reviewed study.  (I have requested permission to quote the report directly, along with its graphs and data.  To date I have not heard from the editors.)</p>
<p>The report concludes that <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/314/5800/787?maxtoshow=&#038;HITS=20&#038;hits=20&#038;RESULTFORMAT=&#038;author1=Worm%2C+B&#038;andorexacttitle=or&#038;andorexacttitleabs=or&#038;fulltext=fish+&#038;andorexactfulltext=and&#038;searchid=1&#038;FIRSTINDEX=0&#038;sortspec=relevance&#038;fdate=7/1/2005&#038;tdate=2/28/2007&#038;resourcetype=HWCIT">there is still time to fish more intelligently to avoid such a collapse</a>.</p>
<p>What will the WTO do here?</p>
<p>And what is our projected course on CO2 emissions?  Again, I offer a small sample of where we are going.  The Energy Bulletin notes that three countries are planning to build 850 new coal plants by 2012—India, the U.S., and China.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The magnitude of that imbalance is staggering. Environmentalists have long called the [Kyoto] treaty a symbolic rather than practical victory in the fight against global warming. But even many of them do not appear aware of the coming tidal wave of greenhouse-gas emissions by nations not under Kyoto restrictions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The report continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2012, the plants in three key countries &#8211; China, India, and the United States &#8211; are expected to emit as much as an extra 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to a Monitor analysis of power-plant construction data. In contrast, Kyoto countries by that year are supposed to have cut their CO2 emissions by some 483 million tons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2012, China is expected to add 562; India, 213; and the U.S., 72.  As for the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (<a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/3768.html">IGCC</a>),</p>
<blockquote><p>“funding for a key billion-dollar [U.S.-based] federal IGCC experimental program called FutureGen is lagging. And unless the US sets a limit on CO2 emissions that creates a market for carbon-reducing technology, there is little financial incentive to invest in such technology, experts say. As a result, the technology appears unlikely to be deployed in time to make much difference in the coming surge of power-plant construction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless we change the way we do business, there is little hope.  Business and trade are the twin epicenters of the coming earthquake.  That earthquake will challenge traditional thinking about economics as nothing has before.  The “externalities” of which economists speak will no longer be appendages to the discussion, or afterthoughts to be consider only by politicians.  They will come marching to center stage, dominating and modifying even the principles of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>The WTO and the principles it enunciates, which seemed fair enough in a pre-21st world, are now inadequate. Countries petitioning for entry need not have any environmental regulations.</p>
<p>The WTO takes no formal position on the environment.  Countries themselves may enter into such agreements, but the WTO prefers to remain neutral to such agreements. For disputes among WTO members, however, the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm">actual wording</a> of the position of the WTO is suggestive but allusive:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But if one side in the dispute has not signed the environment agreement, then the WTO would provide the only possible forum for settling the dispute.  The preference for handling disputes under the environmental agreements does not mean the environmental issues would be ignored in WTO disputes.  The WTO allows panels examining a dispute to seek expert advice on environmental issues.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, the WTO has entertained a number of environmental disputes: The “shrimp-turtle” and the “tuna-dolphin” dispute, oft cited examples.  Both of these cases involved a single endangered species.  The first involved a species of turtle that the U.S. had placed on the endangered species list.  The U.S. required that “turtle excluder” devices be placed on shrimp nets.  Because Malaysia, India, Pakistan, and Thailand did not use such devices, the U.S. put a ban on the importation of shrimp and shrimp products.  The <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm">WTO ruled against the U.S.</a>  Again, its wording is both instructive and suggestive:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In its report, the Appellate Body made clear that under WTO rules, countries have the right to take trade action to protect the environment….The WTO does not have to allow them this right.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The U.S. lost the case, not because it sought to protect the environment but because it discriminated between WTO members</i>… It provided countries in the Western hemisphere—mainly in the Caribbean—technical and financial assistance and longer transition periods for their fisherman to start using turtle-excluder devices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The WTO can take position!  Indeed it will, even if the environmental stance of the two parties differs.</p>
<p> Neither of these cases are anything like the cases that may eventually appear. What if, for example, the fishing habits of one country threaten to crash multiple fish stocks, possibly threatening the entire food chain?  It has entered no international agreement; yea, it is blind to the effects of its present activities.  It sees only the gold in front of its eyes.  </p>
<p>Or, what if the pollution from one country actually starts to change the weather in another?  (This is actually happening.) What if, in response, the offending country is then confronted with a tariff on its goods? Such was the suggestion of French President Chirac in response to U.S. pollution: A carbon tax, really a tariff on U.S. goods. </p>
<p>Now, we can argue in this last instance of whether the pot is calling the kettle black.  Although France has made measurable steps in curbing green house gases, in all likelihood it will fail to meet Kyoto goals.  The U.S., as noted above, will continue its profligate ways.   As an aside, I wonder if Chirac would put the same tax on China and India.  To be successful in the WTO, it cannot discriminate among countries.  And how is the carbon tax to be determined&#8211;CO2 per capita emissions?  And what if the tariff itself is only tenuously or indirectly connected to the CO2 emissions? </p>
<p>To lessen the coming issues, perhaps the WTO should insist that nations petitioning for entrance have environmental regulations more in line with its present members (China excluded, of course.  That cat is out of the bag.)</p>
<p>These are tricky waters, but the WTO, unlike the U.N., has an intelligent and respected arbitration procedure that may indeed work. The U.N. is always faced with the veto.  The U.N. seems to be good at reports, not at action.  It produced the IPCC report.  I think there is a synergy here. </p>
<p>Allow me to comment on two additional issues: (1) the argument from developing nations that any such carbon tax, or even mild Kyoto, is unfair to them and (2) the rather simplistic application of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>The unfairness issue comes from two quarters.  On the one hand, we have the foreign firms and foreign financial interests within China that suddenly have become philanthropic in their motives.  The making of money is their business; to profess otherwise is to be disingenuous.</p>
<p>On the other hand, China itself decries the unfairness.  To China I would say, “Yes, it is unfair.  But you are late to the party.  The industrialize nations have theirs.  In all truth, they should share what they now have.  But you know they will not do that either—witness the sweat shop factories now gainfully employing your poor.  The question you must ask yourself is: Is there time? Is it a Pyrhhic victory you want?  </p>
<p>You and the West are like two felons handcuffed together in a burning house.  Your rich handcuffed partner wants to flee the burning building.  You, however, see a safe that could be opened.  </p>
<p>“There is not time,” your partner shouts. “Any minute now the roof will collapse on both of us.”</p>
<p>“Then give me some of what you have,” you cry, “otherwise, I am going to chance opening the safe.  I will not be poor!”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding,” he shouts.  “What’s mine is mine!”</p>
<p>And so the two of you struggle and argue as the flames leap higher and higher.</p>
<p>I would extend the story to encompass each and every one of us.  There is no escape, not for the rich who have squirreled billions into tax havens nor the poor who insist that the government widen its safety net; not for the economists who do not want to use the tools of their trade to measure “questionable” externalities nor for the investors who have their eye on the bottom line.  Everyone wants more.  Is the GDP down?  Is the stock market up?  Like the poor fools with ten maxed credit cards, our credit, too, is slowly but surely being maxed to the limit.  There is a limit to growth.  We are all subprime borrowers.  In the next twenty or thirty years, all our mortgages will be reset.</p>
<p>Take a true measure of the land and water we have poisoned in the last 50 years.  Count the species that have gone extinct in the last hundred years.   Wealthier we in the west have become.  But what has been its cost, its true cost?  Mere externalities, you say?  The initial equations supporting comparative advantage were not conceived for the problems we now face.  Real and deadly constraints confront us. </p>
<p>The house is burning; the resources are dwindling.  Whether we like it or not, the WTO will be at the center of the conflagration.  We should use this and expand this organization.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers might recall I frequently note that I’m not a huge fan of the Democratic Party – I generally lean toward Democrats, though, because it seems to me that Democrats are less obnoxious than the Republicans, and have been for a few decades.  One sign of being less obnoxious is following policies that make more sense.  Now, we can sit here and argue about one or another policy, but in the end, what matters are results.  (At least until Marketing blurs the picture.)  </p>
<p>Regular readers may recall I often look at different series – debt per capita, healthcare costs, whatever, by Presidential terms.  So in this post, I was planning to do the same with GDP per capita.  (I vaguely recall having a post in which I’ve looked at real GDP per capita growth already.)  But when I do something like that, there is invariably someone who doesn’t like the results and decides to blame the business cycle.  </p>
<p>The problem with the business cycle is that in some ways it makes sense to take into account recessions (or booms), and in some ways it doesn’t, when comparing growth across Presidencies.  Sometimes recessions (or booms) are inherited, and thus the President should not be faulted for a recession (or credited for a boom), but the President’s policies may exacerbate them or even create them.  Or, to put things another way… one bad year (or one spectacular year) may not be the President’s fault (or to the President’s credit).  So maybe knocking off the best and worst years of a President’s term is a helpful way to look at things.  (A President can inherit a recession, but if stagnation is still around after a year, something is seriously wrong, and there’s a good chance that something is the President.)  </p>
<p>The problem is that removing the best and worst year can be a real problem when a President served only three years, such as JFK, or worse, two years, such as Ford.  So instead of looking at administrations, this time around I’m looking at “full terms.”  For purposes of this exercise, say JFK &#038; LBJ served a full term from 1961 to early 1969, and Nixon &#038; Ford together served a full term from 1969 to early 1977.  </p>
<p>The Table below shows the annualized percentage change in real GDP per capita, the growth in the best year of a full term, the growth in the worst year of a full term, and the average of the annual growth when the best and worst years are left out.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdHCV4VHjfI/AAAAAAAAABo/jyTypoOt2gk/s1600-h/God+Punishes+Us+When+We+(Collectively)+Vote+Republican+Pic.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdHCV4VHjfI/AAAAAAAAABo/jyTypoOt2gk/s320/God+Punishes+Us+When+We+(Collectively)+Vote+Republican+Pic.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From the table, we can learn a few things.  <br />1.  It doesn’t appear that leaving out best and worst years makes much of a difference. <br />2.  Growth rates in real GDP per capita tend to be higher under Democrats than under Republicans.  There were three Democrat administrations and five Republican administrations, and all three Democrat administrations were among the 4 fastest growth administrations.  All four of the slowest growing administrations were Republican.<br />3.  The Republican hero-worship of Reagan makes sense, in that he’s the only Republican under whom the growth rate was comparable the growth rate under Democrats.  Of course, he’s no JFK LBJ, but he’s probably within the margin of error of being Clinton and a bit better than Carter if one looks only at real GDP per capita and ignores such issues, say, debt.  <br />4.  When Republicans perform poorly, they don’t mess around.  Every Republican administration had at least one year of negative growth, and for all but one of the Republican administrations, real GDP contracted by more than 1% in the worst year.  By contrast, among Democrats, only Carter had a year in which real GDP per capita shrunk.</p>
<p>So what do we learn from this?  Well, either Republicans pursue policies that simply don’t work (assuming the goal is to make us all better off), or God really doesn’t like it when the President is Republican. </p>
<p>A few wrap-up details….</p>
<p>a.  I hope to find debt by calendar year data and have another post looking at growth of real gdp less debt per capita some time soon.  Regular readers may recall that here at Angry Bear we’ve had quite a few posts looking at deficits and growth rates, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/optimal-size-of-deficit.html">most recently this one</a>, showing that running big deficits is merely a way of postponing taxation and cutting growth in later years.  Accounting for deficits and debt will probably make a fiscally irresponsible President like Reagan look worse.<br />b.  data is from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a><br />c.  For the umpteenth time I ask… why do those who claim they are pro-growth support policies which so obviously lead to slower growth?<br />d.  Don’t people who sell the American public on these silly policies bear some responsibility?  Its one thing when its done once, or twice.  But at some point, isn’t it fraud to push a policy that so obviously hurts most of us?<br />e.  As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants &#8217;em.</p>

<blockquote>The numbers in President Bush&#8217;s budget add up &#8211; arithmetically. If his assumptions come true, the deficit will evaporate in 2012. But there are a lot of ifs &#8211; if Iraq and Afghanistan cost only $50 billion in 2009 and nothing thereafter; if the president and Congress hold growth in annually appropriated domestic spending well below inflation; if they let the alternative minimum tax reach deeper into the middle class or raise taxes on others to prevent that; if Congress squeezes $66 billion (4%) from Medicare over five years. OK &#8230; William Gale of the Brookings Institution think tank &#8211; populated by deficit-fearing Democratic wonks who have been trying to find common ground with deficit-fearing Republican wonks &#8211; has been thinking a lot lately about the parallels between Mr. Bush on Iraq and Mr. Bush on the budget.  &#8220;The Bush administration&#8217;s two signature policies have been the war in Iraq and consistent pressure for tax cuts,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;On the surface, they look quite different and were advocated by different parts of the administration. Look a little deeper and some common patterns emerge &#8212; so maybe this says something about the principles or management style of the Bush administration.&#8221;  It is a provocative and illuminating exercise. Let Mr. Gale kick it off: The president took the U.S. into Iraq with &#8220;falsely rosy scenarios&#8221; about the post-Saddam landscape there, he says. Mr. Bush built his tax cuts in 2001 on a similarly unrealistic hope that the budget surplus was large enough to cut taxes without creating deficits.  Let us keep going. As Iraq proved different and more difficult than anticipated, and contingency planning was regarded by the Bush White House as a sign of weakness, rather than prudence, Mr. Bush vowed to &#8220;stay the course.&#8221; When then-Treasury Secretary Paul O&#8217;Neill and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argued for &#8220;triggers&#8221; to undo tax cuts if budget reality didn&#8217;t match projections, the White House scoffed. Even when the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drove spending on homeland security and the military far above projections, Mr. Bush didn&#8217;t revisit his fiscal strategy.  Smart critics, even inside the administration, were disregarded and shunned. (Gen. Eric Shinseki on troops levels in Iraq, Treasury Secretary O&#8217;Neill on deficits.) Only true believers remained to give the president advice. Eventually, Mr. Bush changed his team &#8212; hiring new secretaries of defense and Treasury &#8211; but too late to get credit from the public or to forge bipartisan consensus in Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Say what you want about Paul O’Neill’s performance as Treasury Secretary.  While he was not Robert Rubin, the reason he was fired was that he refused to drink any more Kool Aid.  David finishes the parallel with:<br />
<blockquote>But look ahead, and there is an unwelcome parallel between Iraq and the budget. Current policy is unsustainable, but there is no easy way out. Extend the president&#8217;s tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration in 2009 and 2010, and the fiscal hole is enormous. Let them expire, and the tax increases could derail the economy. Messrs. Baker and Hamilton had little apparent effect on the president&#8217;s Iraq policy. Maybe they would have better luck on economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – James Baker and Lee Hamilton are not economists.  But they have been plenty of economists, such as William Gale, willing to offer their advice on fiscal policy.  If we had such a commission, would we have any more expectations that this President would pay any attention to its recommendations?  No – we have to bide our time for another couple of years until we have a real President in the White House.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>ON ABC’s <em>This Week</em>, the gang was debating whether rising inequality matters.  Robert Reich was saying yes and noted a self-deprecating joke where he and Shaq were standing on a basketball court – “the average man here is six foot two inches”.  This came right after George Will saying inequality was not that important.  Will tells his joke by saying “three men enter a bar – since one of them was Bill Gates, the average man in the bar is a billionaire”.  That works only if Mr. Gates was paying for the tab and writing big checks to his two champions.  </p>
<p>But didn’t <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/012103.html">Paul Krugman</a> tell the joke this way:<br />
<blockquote>A liberal and a conservative were sitting in a bar. Then Bill Gates walked in. &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re rich!&#8221; shouted the conservative. &#8220;The average person in this bar is now worth more than a billion!&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s silly,&#8221; replied the liberal. &#8220;Bill Gates raises the average, but that doesn&#8217;t make you or me any richer.&#8221; &#8220;Hah!&#8221; said the conservative, &#8220;I see you&#8217;re still practicing the discredited politics of class warfare.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the <em>This Week</em> discussion had already noted that the real income of the median household has not risen even as the mean income has, one has to wonder whether Mr. Will was really paying attention or ever got the point of the joke that he botched.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/steyn/251601,CST-EDT-steyn11.article">Mark Steyn</a> spends most of his Chicago Sun-Times admitting he doubts Global Warming and talking about his credentials on this topic.  He undermines everything in his silly op-ed that came before with this:<br />
<blockquote>In the course of the 20th century, the planet&#8217;s temperature supposedly increased by 0.7 degrees Celsius, which (for those of you who want it to sound scarier) is a smidgeonette over 1 degree Fahrenheit. Is that kinda sorta staying the same or is it a dramatic warming trend? And is nought-point-seven of an uptick worth wrecking the global economy over?</p></blockquote>
<p>This 0.7 degrees Celcius over the past century seems to have been the latest <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/jonah-goldberg-on-economics-of-global.html">rightwing talking point</a>, but it omits the fact that 0.6 of this 0.7 has come in the last 50 years.  Steyn also tries to play economist on TV with his “wrecking the global economy” and this:<br />
<blockquote>And, in return for this meaningless gesture, American GDP in 2010 would be lower by $97 billion to $397 billion &#8211; and those are the U.S. Energy Information Administration&#8217;s somewhat optimistic models. And now Jerry Mahlman of the National Center for Atmospheric Research says &#8220;it might take another 30 Kyotos&#8221; to halt global warming: 30 x $397 billion is . . . er, too many zeroes for my calculator. So, faced with a degree rise in temperature, we could destroy the planet&#8217;s economy, technology, communications and prosperity. And ruin the lives of millions of people. Or we could do what man does best: adapt. You do the math.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn is referring to the EIA’s <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press109.html">Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets and the Economy, October 1998</a>, which noted:<br />
<blockquote>The loss in GDP, plus the funds used to purchase permits internationally, represents the total cost to the economy. Over the period 2008 to 2012, the annual average total cost ranges from $77 billion (1992 dollars) to $338 billion, depending on the level of carbon reductions and the recycling assumptions. This cost is relative to a total economy of $7 trillion in 1996, growing to about $9.5 trillion in 2010, and about $11 trillion in 2020 (1992 dollars).</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn is again reading from the standard rightwing talk points, which often omit the “plus the funds used to purchase permits internationally”.  Steyn is also suggesting that we have only two choices – ignore global warming or go with the Kyoto Protocol.  I would hope the debate would be more directed towards more efficient approaches to slowing the reducing the rate of global warming.  Economists often argue that we should weigh the benefits of reducing global warming – which recognizes that a warmer climate imposes costs on our productive capacity and our general wellbeing – against the costs of addressing this problem.  But for global warming deniers, their question seems to be “what costs on our productive capacity and our general wellbeing?” Let&#8217;s face it, Mark Steyn&#8217;s credentials to be an economist are zero.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/02/road-ahead.html">Greg Mankiw</a> reproduces what might appear to be a shocking document from the latest <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7731&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a> report, which is entitled “Cumulative nominal percentage growth from 2006 level”. As you look at this graph, we should also read the accompanying text:<br />
<blockquote>After 2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation will begin to raise the growth rate of total outlays. The baby boomers will start becoming eligible for Social Security retirement benefits in 2008, when the first members of that generation turn 62. As a result, the annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected to increase from about 4.5 percent in 2008 to 6.5 percent by 2017. In addition, because the cost of health care is likely to continue rising rapidly, spending for Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow even faster &#8211; in the range of 7 percent to 8 percent annually. Total outlays for those two health care programs are projected to more than double by 2017, increasing by 124 percent, while nominal GDP is projected to grow only half as much, by 63 percent (see Summary Figure 1.). Consequently, under the assumptions of CBO&#8217;s baseline, spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will together equal nearly 11 percent of GDP in 2017, compared with a little less than 9 percent this year. Revenues are projected to increase sharply after 2010 given the assumption that various tax provisions expire as scheduled. In the baseline, total revenues grow by 9.2 percent in 2011 and by 7.5 percent in 2012, thereby bringing the budget into surplus. Beyond 2012, revenues are projected to grow at about the same pace as outlays (by roughly 4.5 percent a year), keeping the budget in the black through 2017 under baseline assumptions. Relative to the size of the economy, outlays are projected to range between 18.8 percent and 19.7 percent of GDP during the 2008-2017 period under the assumptions of CBO&#8217;s baseline &#8211; lower than the 20.6 percent average of the past 40 years (see Summary Figure 2.).</p></blockquote>
<p>Three observations here: (1) the rise in the share of entitlements as a share of GDP is not so great that we will see spending exceed 20% of GDP if the rest of this forecast holds; (2) letting the tax cuts expire will insure sufficient tax revenues to cover this rise in entitlement spending; and (3) figure 2 is probably a more meaningful measure as it plots spending and revenues as a share of GDP.  Figure 1 is odd in two respects – the focus on nominal increases rather than real increases and its insistence at showing the cumulative increase.  I guess the goal was more to shock the reader than inform the reader.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I think another graph might prove useful here – that being the cumulative nominal percentage growth from 1998 level in defense spending as reported by the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>. Our graph shows actual data from 1998 to 2006 and uses the CBO projections of GDP for 2007 and 2008.  I had to extrapolate defense spending by assuming that it will grow by 8% per year for the next two years.  Given that the President’s budget proposal calls for DoD spending to be over 17% higher in 2008 than it was in 2006 – my assumption seems reasonable if not conservative.  Now one might infer from the graph that the doubling of defense spending in a decade is, well, just shocking.  But this would represent an increase in the share of GDP devoted to defense where it would grow from 3.95% in 1998 to 5% in 2008.  Not as shocking – is it?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/thousands_lose_jobs_as_michigan">Onion</a> pokes fun at Michigan’s labor market woes:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is a sad day for the people of Michigan,&#8221; Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. &#8220;Our state has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While I bet many residents of Michigan will find this in poor taste, it seems <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGEyMzAxNDUzNjc1NThjNWJkZWY2MTJmMGUyZDQ4ZTk=">John J. Miller</a> of the National Review thinks this is funny.  </p>
<p>Had Mr. Miller done a little fact checking, he might have realized that the only way The Onion’s little joke makes any sense for a long history to be defined as the last six years.  Our graph shows Michigan’s and the nation’s unemployment rate from January 1997 to December 2006.  During Clinton’s second term, the state’s unemployment rate was below the already low national unemployment rate.  The state’s unemployment rate, however, rose even more than the nation’s during the 2001 to 2003 period.  While the nation’s unemployment rate has declined – Michigan’s unemployment rate has not.  </p>
<p>But you know – it does seem like a very long time since we’ve had a real leader in the White House.  Somehow, I don’t think this was Mr. Miller’s point.  But then what was his point?</p>

But hang on a second folks and let’s focus here:<br />
<blockquote>Q: does the Treasury tell him that more money is coming in than was lost to the tax cuts? <br />MR. SNOW: Well, I&#8217;m not sure &#8211; the whole point is that the tax cuts generate extra economic activity. All you have to do is &#8211; I would, if you want to <br />Q: That&#8217;s a separate issue. <br />MR. SNOW: Well, no, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not a separate issue at all. What it says is when you have greater economic  <br />Q: If the economy is growing more, that&#8217;s one thing; but whether tax revenues are growing is a separate issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is not a separate issue.  The impact of a reduction in tax rates on tax revenues does depend on whether it increases economic activity and by how much.  The supply-side crowd wants you to believe that a 1 percent reduction in tax rates will lead to an increase in economic activity that is greater than 1 percent, which is a proposition that has been ridiculed by <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-years-plea.html">Andrew Samwick</a> and many other economists.  But let’s go further and stipulate that Bush’s fiscal game seems to be long-term stimulus, which means less national savings.  And that means less long-term growth, not more.  So Tony Snow has it backwards – the whole point is that fiscal irresponsibility generates less economic activity in the long-run.</p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/does_tony_snows.html">Mark Thoma</a> who adds:<br />
<blockquote>Does the president continue to repeat this because (a) people are afraid to tell him the truth about tax cuts, (b) he&#8217;s been told the truth, but chooses to repeat the tax cuts pay for themselves mantra anyway, (c) it&#8217;s been explained to him, but he doesn&#8217;t get it, (d) he&#8217;s decided, as with other issues, that everyone else is wrong and only he sees the truth about tax cuts &#8211; they do pay for themselves despite evidence to the contrary, (e) someone he trusts, perhaps someone who has influence on who can access the president, is telling him that tax cuts pay for themselves and he believes it, (f) there&#8217;s an obscure model somewhere built with the intent of proving this that might, and only might, under the right assumptions, show this effect. That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s needed &#8211; some evidence somewhere no matter how flimsy &#8211; to sell the policy, a lesson learned in the run-up to the Iraq war, or (g) none of the above.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it.  Nobel Prize winning economist Tony Snow who doubles as Bush’s press secretary has constructed some obscure model where reducing the national savings rate leads to more growth!  Someone call the American Economic Review so they might publish the Snow model.</p>
