                                <p>If President Lincoln said the following:<br />
<blockquote>Congressmen who willfully take action during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs, and should be arrested, exiled or hanged</p></blockquote>
<p>We should demand his portrait be removed for the $5 bill.  But that’s why the face of <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/article415.html">J. Michael Waller</a> is not in my wallet.  Poor Congressman <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/02/16/rep-young-r-ak-uses-fabricated-lincoln-quote-on-house-floor">Don Young</a> &#8211; C-Span runs how he was suckered by rightwingers such as Frank Gaffney.  </p>
<p>But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_War#Declaration_of_war">this</a> is interesting:<br />
<blockquote>Whigs in both the North and South generally opposed the war, while Democrats mostly supported it. Whig Abraham Lincoln contested the causes for the war and demanded to know the exact spot on which Thornton had been attacked and U.S. blood had been shed. He was quoted as saying &#8220;Show me the spot.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/02/don_young_lets_hang_abraham_lincoln.php">Mark Kleiman</a> for the post “Don Young: Let’s Hang Abraham Lincoln”.</p>
<p>We should also remember that Republicans – including John McCain – felt free to oppose the decisions of the Commander-in-Chief when the President’s name was Bill Clinton.</p>

                                <p>The ex-Girlfriend and I were talking about a friend of hers that has a Video Store in downtown LA.  We both thought perhaps its time to, if not leave the business, find a way to diversify, what with this being the era of Netflix.  Clearly, he had in mind focusing on foreign &#038; indie films as his niche, but Netflix (like other online retailers) can play in the long tail as well.</p>
<p>Which leads to a few questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  What should someone who owns a video store diverisfy into?  Music seems like an obvious route, but in an era of i-Tunes that seems less rational than video.<br />2.  What should Netflix diversify into when broadband becomes fast or efficient enough to download movies almost as conveniently as i-Tunes will deliver music today?</p>

                                <p>A friend of the ex-Girlfriend’s is the North American distributor for what I am told is a well-known fashionable line of shoes.  I understand that for several years, she has been their top salesperson world-wide.  The company has always made their shoes in Spain, but this year, they decided to make shoes in China.</p>
<p>The ex-Girlfriend’s friend has a few problems with this.  First, it seems that the Chinese manufacturers have missed a number of deadlines.  The product has not shipped, sales calls have had to be cancelled or postponed, and retailers are getting irate.  The second is that “Made in Spain” or “Made in Italy” seems to have a certain cachet that “Made in China” does not among people willing to spend $200 + on shoes.  </p>
<p>Will all that change?  And how long will it take?</p>
<p>PS.  The series on Republican and Democrat Presidents will continue on Monday.  I’ve been looking at data and found something I think is very interesting.  Basically, I think I can explain why any given Democrat performed better or worse than other Democrats, and why any given Republican performed better or worse than other Republicans.  I want to mull on what I’ve found for a bit before I write it up.</p>

                                <p>It has become a rare day that the smart and honest conservative known as <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDFmNzI2MjcxOThjMzk5MjU2MjkzNjljOGI0MDFhY2E=">Bruce Bartlett</a> agrees to write something for the National Review.  Some of this is informative:<br />
<blockquote>According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2001 the gross tax gap was $345 billion, which fell to $290 billion following enforcement efforts. This suggests that about 14 percent of all taxes that are owed annually are not paid &#8211; a figure that is no higher today than it was in the 1980s. These numbers are primarily for individual income and payroll taxes; the IRS has not updated its research on corporate-tax compliance for decades. One reason for this is that the line between tax evasion and legal tax avoidance in the corporate sector is very, very murky. For many corporations, it’s not worth the bother to evade taxes when there are so many legal tax-avoidance opportunities available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope Bruce is not counting the abuse of non-arm’s length pricing as being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Legal-Campaign-Benefit-Everybody/dp/1591840198">Perfectly Legal</a> and consistent with section 482.  Such abuses are where the real money lies and it is shame that the IRS goes after the pennies from the working poor while allowing multinationals the right to shift profits to places like Switzerland.  </p>
<p>Bruce continues:<br />
<blockquote>In practice, the IRS has to concentrate its resources on areas where there is the greatest potential revenue yield, which may not be where the greatest amount of evasion exists.  For example, a high percentage of alimony income goes unreported, but the total amount of alimony paid is so small that the aggregate dollar amount of evasion is tiny. The same is true of unreported state tax refunds and unemployment compensation. Indeed, the relatively high level of non-reporting from these income sources may be due largely to taxpayer ignorance that such income is in fact taxable. The point here is that closing the tax gap in ways that will yield significant revenue to the government is much harder than generally believed. Most people think the IRS just needs to audit more people. But unless it has good reason in advance to believe that fairly substantial revenues will result from an audit, the practice could easily be counterproductive. The increased deterrent effect could be more than offset by taxpayer complaints that will result in efforts by Congress to tie the IRS’s hands and cut its budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if the IRS does not enforce the tax code, there would be no deterrence.  So the bean counting of how much we could collect understates the value of enforcement.  But I agree with Bruce’s “concentrate its resources on areas where there is the greatest potential revenue yield”.  Might I suggest that the IRS should follow this advice in terms of enforcing the transfer pricing rules?  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/02/14/ap3428247.html">Linda Johnson</a> of Forbes gives us one example:<br />
<blockquote>Merck &#038; Co., mired in multibillion litigation over its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx, has eliminated another legal headache, resolving several tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service by agreeing to a $2.3 billion settlement &#8230; Tax and accounting analyst Robert Willens of Lehman Brothers said in such cases drugmakers generally sell medicines at low cost to subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, which can then mark up the price and keep more profit after taxes.  &#8220;This is a constant tug-of-war between the IRS&#8221; and companies, Willens said. He said Merck paid a very high percentage of the amount of taxes in dispute &#8211; about 60 percent &#8211; far higher than the one-third or so that is typical. &#8220;That would suggest Merck must have felt it had a fairly weak case,&#8221; Willens said.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Glaxo litigation, the IRS argued that the drug importer overcharged its U.S. subsidiary.  In a recent settlement, the government collected $3.4 billion. This precisely why we should be listening to folks like David Cay Johnston.  And yes I realize that had Bruce said that, Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg would not have allowed him to publish his piece at the National Review.  But isn’t that why Bruce should be allowed alternative places to publish his thinking?</p>

                                <p>Pardon me for peeking over at the National Review again, but the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjgwOWEzMTUwMzc4N2U3MmFhZTdlMmJlNTQ3Nzk0NzQ=">Thomas Sowell</a> is just too funny:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you take the mainstream media seriously, you might think that every important scientist believes that “global warming” poses a great threat, and that we need to make drastic changes in the way we live, in order to avoid catastrophes to the environment, to various species, and to ourselves &#8230; The very attempt to silence all who disagree about global warming ought to raise red flags. Anyone who remembers the 1970s should remember the Club of Rome report that was supposed to be the last word on economic growth grinding to a halt, “overpopulation” and a rapidly approaching era of mass starvation in the 1980s. In reality, the 1980s saw increased economic growth around the world and, far from mass starvation, an increase in obesity and agricultural surpluses in many countries. But much of the media went for the Club of Rome report and hyped the hysteria.  Many in the media resent any suggestion that they are either shilling for an ideological agenda or hyping whatever will sell newspapers or get higher ratings on TV. Here is their chance to check out some heavyweight scientists specializing in weather and climate, instead of taking Al Gore’s movie or the pronouncements of government bureaucrats and politicians as the last word.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not quite sure what he’s talking about with respect to his (false) premise that we all believed the predictions of the Club of Rome report.  And I certainly have no idea why he claims that we are trying to silence the few heretics who doubt global warming as our government still honors the First Amendment (as long as one is not criticizing George Bush’s Iraq policies).  But hey – you find Ph.D.s in economics who try to deny the law of scarcity – including this <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjY4MWIzODlmZjg3NmMxOTU4OTRkYzFlYmIzNTM3NWE=">National Review nitwit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the idea that making the tax-rate cuts permanent will be bad for the economy, the critics rely on an additional piece of information: the budget deficit. Proponents of this doomsday view believe that lower tax rates lead to persistent deficits which in turn “crowd-out” private investment and in the long run result in higher interest rates and lower growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Victor Canto decides to invoke the name of William of Ockham was who lived from 1288 to 1348.  Maybe Ockham didn’t understand the basics of Solow’s growth theory given that his seminal paper was written in the late 1950’s.  But one would think a Ph.D. in 2007 would understand that reducing national savings lowers long-term growth.  </p>
<p>But there are heretics in every profession.  <em>Memo to Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg</em>: if you insist on publishing such incredibly stupid stuff, be careful not to put two things out on the same day that nullify each other so blatantly.</p>

<blockquote>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday rejected a Democratic lawmaker&#8217;s suggestion that he consider cutting interest rates to bolster the economy.  Bernanke, testifying for a second day on Capitol Hill, this time before the House Financial Services Committee, repeated that the Fed is likely to hold rates steady for a while if slower economic growth nudges inflation lower this year and next as expected.  But the Fed also thinks inflation is too high and might go higher, Bernanke said. If he and his colleagues adjust borrowing costs in coming months, they are more likely to raise rates than lower them. &#8220;In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be well controlled,&#8221; Bernanke said in response to remarks by committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.). &#8220;If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates.&#8221; Frank had told Bernanke the Fed&#8217;s stance was &#8220;troubling&#8221; to him because the central bank also forecasts the economy will grow at a moderate rate this year, below its long-term average, and that inflation will drift lower over time. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we get a concern of inflation,&#8221; Frank told Bernanke. &#8220;Why is there not at least an equal chance for there to be a reduction&#8221; in interest rates? Bernanke responded that he and his Fed colleagues see several risks that the economy may not behave as forecast, and they would adjust interest rates as needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman Ben is better at forecasting than this Angrybear and he certainly has his views on how close we might be to full employment.  But the following got <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/inflation_and_unemployment_ber.html#015529">Dean Baker</a> riled up:<br />
<blockquote>There is no specific level of unemployment that automatically triggers inflation, Bernanke, a former chairman of the Princeton University economics department, said in response to several lawmakers&#8217; questions. That contrasts with the traditional view of many economists that unemployment below about 5 percent is inflationary. Bernanke&#8217;s remarks partly reflect years of research that has debunked the idea of a long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation. They also reflect the nation&#8217;s experience in the late 1990s, when unemployment fell as low as 3.9 percent without causing much inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean writes:<br />
<blockquote>The article implies that Bernanke&#8217;s position is based on a solid body of economic research: &#8220;Bernanke&#8217;s remarks partly reflect years of research that has debunked the idea of a long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation.&#8221; Actually, Mr. Frank was not proposing that the Fed lower rates with the idea that there would be a long-term trade-off between inflation and unemployment, he was suggesting that the Fed could lower rates and thereby lower unemployment, with no clear impact on inflation. This is exactly the path that Alan Greenspan followed in the mid-90s when he allowed interest rates to stay low and the unemployment rate to continue to fall even though the unemployment rate was already below 6.0 percent, the generally accepted estimate for the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) at the time. The Greenspan experiment refuted the prevailing economic views about the relationship between inflation and unemployment. At this point, there is no widely accepted body of research on this topic. It is inaccurate to imply to readers that Mr. Bernanke is relying on a large body of research in rejecting suggestions for a rate cut. He isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s make this simple by first stating that Mr. Henderson’s reference to some alleged long-term Phillips curve trade-off was just stupid.  I think we’ve all moved past that canard.  From time to time, I have mused as to what the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/employment-over-past-six-years.html">Natural Rate of the Employment to Population Ratio</a> might be.   The current Employment to Population Ratio is 63.3% and my guess has been that the natural rate is closer to 64%.  Some of our conservative blogging economist friends have suggested it might be a little lower than my guess.  If Chairman Ben thinks the natural rate is closer to 63.5%, then fine.  But there is not a “large body of research” proving me right and him wrong nor visa versa.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>By now I’ve pissed off a lot of you.  Tuesday, I looked at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">changes in real GDP per capita over Presidential administrations</a>, on Wednesday I took into account the national debt, thus looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_14.html">changes in real GDP less increases in debt per capita over Presidential administrations</a>.  Thursday I suggested some <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_15.html">reasons</a> why Republican Presidents might perform poorly relative to Democrats, especially when debt is taken into account.  </p>
<p>Several readers have suggested the results are nothing more than a coincidence.  One might note that I have titled this series somewhat facetiously; even if there is no reason for it other than coincidence, for some reason, we have had higher growth in real GDP less increases in real debt per capita when Democrats have been in office than when Republicans have been in office.  </p>
<p>But perhaps, as some readers suggested, the fault lies with Congress.  That can be checked.  </p>
<p>The growth rate in real (GDP less increases in debt) per capita when both chambers of Congress are Democrat, when both chambers are Republican, and when each chamber is controlled by a different party are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7aYVHjjI/AAAAAAAAACU/AhdZdyOgXrk/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7aYVHjjI/AAAAAAAAACU/AhdZdyOgXrk/s320/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This would seem to indicate that the results observed by Presidency also apply to Congress…. growth rates of real GDP less real increases in the debt per capita are higher under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses.</p>
<p>But… what about when we take the President into account?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7TYVHjiI/AAAAAAAAACM/pN8xeaMIbCo/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdW7TYVHjiI/AAAAAAAAACM/pN8xeaMIbCo/s320/God+Punishes,+part+4,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>When the President has been a Democrat, growth has been higher when the Congress was also controlled by Democrats.  </p>
<p>When the President has been a Republican, growth has been lower when the Congress was also controlled by Republicans.  (A mixed congress actually works best under a Republican President – perhaps the split makes it more difficult to make a difficult with Congress to put forth the President’s growth destroying policies.)  </p>
<p>Now, these results were somewhat surprising to me.  I did not expect a Democratic Congress to perform better than a Republican Congress.  I haven’t checked, but I’m told that growth in GDP (nominal, not per capita) is faster under Republican Congresses than under Demcratic Congresses.  So what gives?  I suspect that despite their respective reputations, Democrats, whether in Congress or in the White House, are less likely to run up the debt.  (We’re looking at changes in real GDP less increases in the debt, after all.)  Tax and spend seems to be more constructive than don’t tax and don’t spend, especially when the “don’t spend” part drops out of the equation.</p>
<p>As an example…  consider the period under Clinton.  Growth rates in GDP were higher in the latter half of his term…  but the biggest cuts in the deficit (and hence the big slowdowns in the rate of increase in the debt) came early – before the Republican Revolution.  Thus, changes in what matters  &#8211; real (GDP less increases in the debt) per capita were actually slightly higher in the first two years of Clinton’s term than after.  Whatever the transmission mechanism, one of the important factors in the difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans are more likely to leave a legacy of debt to the future.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, whether by coincidence, Act of God, luck, or better policies, growth rates have been higher under Democratic Presidents than under Republican Presidents, and growth rates have been higher under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses.</p>

<p>Data</p>
<p>Debt came <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm">from from 1950 to 2005</a> can be obtained from the Treasury; this data set provides data from 1953 to 1985 for December 31st of each year, and for 1985 to 2005 for September 30th of each year.  Data for September 2006 was also obtained <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/NPGateway">from the Treasury</a>.   </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  However, to match the debt series, this time I used Q4 data through 1985, and Q3 data thereafter.</p>

                                <p>The House <a href="http://budget.house.gov/analyses/07CBO_baseline_report_1_24.pdf">Committee on the Budget</a> projects this to grow to $761 billion by 2017.  What is the non-social security deficit with additional items?  The additional items include the cost of extending the tax cuts and realistic defense spending projections.  While <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002862.html">Max Sawicky</a> objects, he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats say the &#8220;true size of the deficit&#8221; should include the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. This bumps up the $172 billion FY2007 deficit up to $362b.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, the Trust Fund surplus is counted as a revenue source for the government as Max notes.  I trust Max does not agree with rightwingers and this White House that this revenue should be devoted for extending tax cuts for the rich as opposed to funding the Social Security benefits through 2050 or so.  </p>
<p>While Max suspects there is more nonsense in this document, we should note that the Democrats have thoroughly rejected the Laugher Curve nonsense that reducing national savings is good for long-term growth.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: What this report does is similar in spirit to something <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/budget-forecasts.html">Kash</a> wrote and I tried to use to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/projected-federal-debt-to-gdp-ratio.html">extrapolate</a> where the total Federal debt to GDP ratio would be heading.  My attempt to do this suggested that we might hit a debt to GDP ratio near 75% by 2017 but as I read this report’s forecast, they are suggesting it will still be just shy of 70%.  So maybe the House Democrats are being optimists wit what “an effort to jump up the number and hype fiscal crisis”.  </p>
<p>To be fair – this forecast assumes we continue with Bush’s fiscal folly, which always promises things will get better only to find out things become worse then we could ever imagine.  Yes – only two more years to our nightmare.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This is one prediction I am not happy to see coming to pass.  The housing slump was today <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070215/ap_on_bi_ge/housing_slump;_ylt=ArE.VnH7brTUMq99JbJ_8gdI2ocA">reported</a> to have spread to most of the country, with 40 states seeing sales falling and price decreases in many urban areas.  It is somewhat ironic that this report comes out right at the moment the Fed Chief is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/feb2007/pi20070215_025927.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives">telling Congress</a>  that the economy is looking pretty good.  Maybe it is in the aggregate but it is hard not to see the housing slump as a harbinger of more to come as the air comes out of the housing bubble we have seen in many coastal urban areas.  As noted in various previous posts on this topic, the US economy will need to produce more traded goods (i.e. manufactures, among others) and less non-traded goods (i.e. houses) if it is to ever close the gap in its trade balance.  Indeed, if you are one who believes that foreigners will be willing to finance this gap for the rest of time then there is no need to worry.  For the rest of us, we will hope that this shift happens gradually and not all at once.  But it does seem that the shift is starting to happen.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTMxODhhYjQ5N2RhODZiYmRkY2M1ZmFmYjMzZmVhNTM=">Thomas Sowell</a> asks “What exactly does John Kerry think a think tank does?”  What was the context:</p>
<blockquote><p>AEI has planned a roundtable discussion of global warming, attended by people with differing views on the subject. That was their fundamental sin, in the eyes of the global-warming crowd. They treated this as an issue, rather than a dogma &#8230; These senators express “our very serious concerns” about reports that AEI “offered to pay scientists up to $10,000 for questioning the findings” of other scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d have no problem if scientists were paid to offer up their opinion – regardless of which way it went.  So what was AEI expecting from those scientists who reviewed this “major climate change report”?  If they paid $10,000 to each scientist independent of what the scientist was going to say on this issue, I can see Sowell’s point.  In other words, would the AEI have paid $10,000 to a scientist who agree with the finding of the report?  If the payments were only offered to those who agreed with the rightwing global warming deniers, however, then this is academic prostitution.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_01_28-2007_02_03.shtml#1170541963">Jonathan Adler</a> gave the folks over an AEI to defend themselves and then concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there were evidence that AEI was trying to get individual scientists to change their tune in return for large honoraria, there would undoubtedly be a story here. But there is no evidence this occurred. The general views of Professors Schroeder and North are well knowm to those who work in this area, and were unlikely to be swayed by ths offer (and they were not). More broadly, just as there may be financial incentives to write analyses desired by corporate funders, there are also financial incentives to tailor research projects and findings to increase the likelihood of receiving government grants. This is why I believe scientific studies should be analyzed on their merits, not the source of funding. In the end, some may wish AEI was not sponsoring critical research and analysis of the IPCC report and current climate policy proposals, but it&#8217;s hardly a scandal that they do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wasn’t saying that AEI bribed Steve Schroeder to change his views.  What I was saying was the AEI was only invited those who agreed with their position, such as Steve Schroeder, to present.  Now if they did pay for those scientists whose research suggests global warming is occurring and is due to human activity – I’ll apologize for this post.</p>
