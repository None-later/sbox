                                <p>Jim Caserta sent me a post he wrote about the factors on the Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom.  He looked at how <a href="http://jimcaserta.blogspot.com/2007/02/digging-deeper-into-heritage-foundation.html">factors on the index correlated with GDP per capita</a>.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you read the post, and only add that perhaps its time for Heritage to be less concerned with taxes and government.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020702550.html">Shailagh Murray</a> reports that we may about to witness the return of the Senate:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Republicans who earlier this week helped block deliberations on a resolution opposing President Bush&#8217;s new troop deployments in Iraq changed course yesterday and vowed to use every tactic at their disposal to ensure a full and open debate. In a letter distributed yesterday evening to Senate leaders, John W. Warner (Va.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.) and five other GOP supporters of the resolution threatened to attach their measure to any bill sent to the floor in the coming weeks. Noting that the war is the &#8220;most pressing issue of our time,&#8221; the senators declared: &#8220;We will explore all of our options under the Senate procedures and practices to ensure a full and open debate.&#8221; &#8230; The letter began circulating yesterday evening after it became apparent the Senate was deadlocked over the war resolution and Reid was prepared to move on to other matters. McConnell and many in his party have aggressively defended their decision to block the bipartisan resolution as an issue of fairness because Democrats would not agree to GOP procedural demands. But some Republicans were uneasy about appearing to have stymied the debate. The letter appeared so suddenly that, although it was addressed to Reid, the Democratic leader had not seen his copy before Warner read the text on the Senate floor. &#8220;Monday&#8217;s procedural vote should not be interpreted as any lessening of our resolve to go forward advocating the concepts&#8221; of the resolution, the letter said. &#8220;The current stalemate is unacceptable to us and to the people of this country.&#8221; &#8230; A top Pentagon leader weighed in yesterday on the war debate and appeared to undercut the argument advanced by the White House and many GOP lawmakers that a congressional debate challenging the Bush plan would hurt troop morale. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in Washington strengthens our democracy. Period,&#8221; Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the House Armed Services Committee. He added that potential enemies may take some comfort from the rancor but said they &#8220;don&#8217;t have a clue how democracy works.&#8221; &#8230; The other Republican senators who signed the letter were Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, Norm Coleman (Minn.), Gordon Smith (Ore.), and George V. Voinovich (Ohio). Democrats brushed off the Republicans&#8217; declaration as too little, too late. Reid spokesman Jim Manley said in a statement: &#8220;Senator Reid gave Senator Warner and the others a chance to vote for their own resolution on Monday, but only two of them chose to do so. Hopefully this letter signifies that the others have had a change of heart, and will be willing to vote for their own resolution in the future.&#8221;&#8230; House Democrats had hoped for a large bipartisan Senate vote on Warner&#8217;s resolution to create momentum in the House and to provide maximum pressure on Republicans to go along. But with the Senate at a standstill, House leaders are considering a straightforward resolution that opposes the troop increase, without the multiple provisions that complicated Warner&#8217;s text. Senior House Democrats predicted that their measure will attract overwhelming party support and possibly as many as 30 GOP votes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can someone tell me why the Senate Democrats were so willing to let Mitch McConnell’s tactics block this debate?  We should all applaud Senator Warner and the other six GOP Senators who are willing to stall the passage of these spending bills (the ones the last Congress under GOP control never got around to) until Warner’s resolution is voted on.  Just imagine 80 Senators giving this White House what amounts to a no confidence vote.  We should also thank General Pace for his comments, which undercut the garbage from this White House about not supporting the troops.  It would appear to me that Senator Warner is challenging the leadership of Mitch McConnell.  All I have to add is: <strong>IT’S ABOUT TIME!</strong></p>
<p><em>Update</em>: The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmUwZmExNmQzZmM2NGYyMzQwMWUxZWUzYzBmYjE0NjM=">National Review</a> praises the stalling tactics of Mitch “all we want is an up or down vote” McConnell, while <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjY1MTQ4NTcwZDc3ZWEwZDc5NzMwN2NlOWRhMjRkY2M=">Fred Eckert</a> mocks those who would put forth such resolutions:<br />
<blockquote>Besides the affront to the Constitution, what we have been witnessing demonstrates a frightening lack of clear thinking and common sense. These congressmen have been undermining the morale of our troops, uplifting the spirit of our enemies, and making fools of themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right boys and girls, the National Review will publish any rubbish that backs the tyrannical behavior of the Liar-in-Chief.  Thank goodness that there are a few Republican Senators who actually understand both the Constitution and what is right for our nation.</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: Thanks to the reader who pointed out that the article was referring to 30 House Republicans – not 30 Senate Republicans.  My apologies for hoping too much!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We’re at the last of <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm">Brian Riedl’s Ten Myths</a>.  Before I go on, I’d like to thank Brian Riedl.  Despite the snark, not to say uncalled for insults, I hurled in his direction at the beginning of this process, he’s been a good sport, and he’s been taking time to come here and argue the points.  Given that the budget has just been released, it’s a very busy week for him, so the time issue should not be underestimated.  </p>
<p>Here’s Myth 10 </p>
<p>“Myth #10: The Bush tax cuts were tilted toward the rich.<br />Fact: The rich are now shouldering even more of the income tax burden.”</p>
<p>Riedl is right about this, but I don&#8217;t think its a selling point.  Recall that, as I noted in another post, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">real per capita income has been declining</a>.  In fact, it declined every year from 2000 until 2004.  Its up in 2005 but still below 2000 level.  Aside from whether having the wealthy pay a greater share of the tax burden than before is enough to make up for the fact that most of us have less income than ever before, it should be noted that the real GDP per capita is growing.  If on average we have less real income but real GDP per capita is growing, where is the extra income going?  Presumably to the folks at the top.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Census doesn’t break down data on real income per person into quintiles (unless I’m just not seeing it), but they do provide <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h02ar.html">share of aggregate income received by each fifth and top 5 percent</a>.  Since 2000, the share going to the bottom 3 quintiles has dropped.  The fourth quintile has stayed constant, and the fifth quintile has seen an increase.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f02ar.html">Family income shows a similar pattern</a>, except that the fourth quintile is also slightly better off since 2000.)</p>
<p>Thus… the wealthy are paying more because they are becoming more wealthy while everyone else is getting poorer.  (Note – this is not to bash GW.  These trends have been around for a while.  The same could have been said under Clinton, for example.)  Even under a flat tax that would be true.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Update&#8230;.  Check out the second table on this page which shows <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f01ar.html">real income per family by quintiles and the top 5%</a> in constant 2005 dollars.  (The first table shows nominal dollars.)  The bottom quintile is making more money than in 2000, and quintiles 2 through 5 are making less.  The ones making out like bandits are the top 5%.  The same is true since 2001.  In other words&#8230; sure, the rich are paying more.  Under Clinton, even if the distribution got more uneven, everyone got better off.  Under GW, most people are getting screwed.</p>
<p>So sure, Riedl is right.  The rich are paying more.  But that&#8217;s because, unlike the rest of us, they&#8217;re making more money than they were in 2000.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/02/us_saving_not_q.html">David Altig</a> follows up on a post by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/things-that-cant-go-on-forever.html">Steven Kyle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Steven has pgl around to point out that the most recent data is about personal saving by households &#8211; not private saving (which includes business saving) or national saving (which adds government surpluses to private saving).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the kind words David, but I was a bit lazy.  I should have done the hard work and graphed the net private savings/GDP and net national savings/GDP ratios over time.  The good news is David provides this graph from 1970 to the present.  So let me chip in a couple of ways.  First, notice a couple of things about the national savings rate.  Back in 1970, it was almost 10% as the net private savings rate was around 10% and the government was not running massive deficits.  Alas, the 1980’s changed the latter and despite certain predictions from the Ricardian Equivalence crowd, private savings did not completely offset the government deficits.  The 1990’s saw private savings decline but not as much as the government deficit declined so we enjoyed at least some increase in the national savings rate.  However, the fiscal irresponsibility of the Bush Administration changed all of that so we now have a fairly low national savings rate. </p>
<p>David links to several folks who are “reminding us that saving calculated from the National Income and Product Accounts does not really measure changes in the value of assets &#8211; a more appropriate measure of saving”. For example, the folks that run the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/weekend/hottopic/?id=110009619">Wall Street Journal editorial page</a> write:<br />
<blockquote>As a statistic, however, the official &#8220;savings rate&#8221; is nearly as useless a guide to prosperity as the trade deficit. In the government accounts, what is called the savings rate is literally income less consumption. But the government defines income too narrowly and consumption broadly. For example, &#8220;income&#8221; doesn&#8217;t measure capital gains (whether realized or not), the rising value of your home, or even increases in your retirement accounts. Think about how you calculate your own personal &#8220;savings rate.&#8221; Do you merely add up what you make in salary in a year minus what you spend? Or do you sneak a peak at whether your IRA increased in value, or check the sale price your neighbor got on his home to figure out what you might be able to get for yours? By any normal definition, &#8220;savings&#8221; should include your increase in total assets&#8211;in other words, your gains in overall wealth. For our part, these columns long ago began to watch a far more instructive figure known as &#8220;household net worth.&#8221; That number, released by the Federal Reserve, includes all assets (tangible and financial) held by individuals less their liabilities (mortgage and other debt). At the end of last year&#8217;s third quarter, U.S. household net worth had climbed to $54.1 trillion. That was an increase of more than $3 trillion over the previous four quarters.</p></blockquote>
<p>This claim is an old canard that has basically three problems.  One is that capital gains are a noisy series and the wealth is exploding crowd tends to crow about periods of capital gains and ignore periods where we have seen capital losses.  If we look at table B.100 of the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1">Flow of Funds Acoounts</a>, we do see the household net worth was $54,063.7 billion at least reporting, which compares to the $38,812.9 billion at the end of 2002.  You might say – wow, a 39.3% increase in less than four years.  But remember, this figure was $42,259.9 billion at the end of 1999.  But isn’t a 27.9% increase over a period of only 6.75 years still amazing?   Well, not in real per capita terms.  Prices rose by 18.2% over this period.  Restating these figures in terms of 2000$, net worth was $42,913.3 billion at the end of 1999 and was $46,428.1 billion as of 2006QIII.  In other words, an 8.2% increase during a period where the population grew by 7%.  So if someone told you that real wealth per capita grew by only 1.1% over a 7-year period, doesn’t that sound like a low net private savings rate?  And let’s also remember that real government debt per capita has also grown during this period.</p>

                                <p>I’ve posted before on Mitt Romney’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/something-wicked-this-way-comes.html">signaling to voters that he intends to be very irresponsible</a>.  I’ve also had any number of posts looking at data and failing to find any correlation between cutting federal tax rates and faster growth at anything resembling current tax rates &#8211; too many to link to any one in particular.  (I have had a few posts showing a correlation between cutting federal tax rates and higher debt.)  </p>
<p>So… without further ado, here’s Mr. Kudlow telling us <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzA1MjkyNTkwYTUwOTZiZTRlZjExYjc4MmRiODk3OTk=">what Romney will propose</a>:  </p>
<p>“Mr. Romney is mulling over a cut in the top personal tax rate to 30 percent from 35 percent, as well as a reduction in the corporate income tax, and deep cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits. He’s also expected to propose an expansion in tax-free savings accounts.”</p>
<p>I hope y&#8217;all enjoy a nice big serving of more debt, slower increases in real per capita income, and more money in Steve Forbes&#8217; pocket because that&#8217;s what is on the menu.</p>

<p>I sort of went off <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/could-someone-tell-kudlow-that-poor.html">yesterday</a> at something in the <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&#038;status=article&#038;id=255313573617641">Investor’s Business Daily</a>.  IBD was saying the 33.6% tax burden was unprecedented and that the dip in the tax burden was turning around and started going back up.  IBD omits the fact that this dip in the tax burden comes at the cost of large government deficits, which means the tax burden was not reduced but only deferred. </p>
<p>My complaint should have been with its claim that Americans have historically paid a lot in taxes.  A lot should be compared to something such as tax burdens in other nations and we should also look at this over an extended period of time, which is one of the purposes of our graph.  During the late 1940’s and most of the 1950’s, their measure of the tax burden had it below 25%.  And this was a period when the Federal debt to GDP ratio was declining.  Total Federal debt as a share of GDP is currently increasing.  I guess the folks at IBD could point out that we currently have a larger government than we did under President Eisenhower, but that’s not going to change even if we continue to elect the Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow Republicans that <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDA2Nzc2MjMwYzQ3Yjk4YmFmYjMwM2RhZTlhZGUxMzE=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> prefers.  </p>
<p>But the real purpose of our graph is to examine the composition of taxes over time.  Kudlow likes to claim only rich people pay taxes as he seems to think the only tax anyone pays is the Federal income tax.  He is not alone as focusing on the progressivity of the Federal income tax is an old rightwing trick.  But notice something – the ratio of Federal income taxes has declined from around 15% to around 10% over the same period when total taxes to GDP has risen from less than 25% to more than 30%?  Part of this difference comes from an increase in payroll taxes and part comes from an increase in taxes collected at the state&#038;local (S&#038;L) level.  While some of state and local tax revenues also come from income taxes, much of it comes from other sources such as sales taxes.  Memo to Larry – the working poor pay both sales taxes and payroll taxes.  And the shares of those two tax sources have increased over time, while the share of Federal income taxes has declined.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We’re getting to the end of  <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg2001.cfm">Brian Riedl’s Ten Myths</a>.  Here’s Myth 9 </p>
<p>“Myth #9: The Bush tax cuts have not helped the economy.<br />Fact: The economy responded strongly to the 2003 tax cuts.”</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this.  </p>
<p>1.  The annualized percentage growth in real GDP per capita from 2002 to 2006 was 2.28%.  From 1992 to 2000, it was 2.49%.  From 1976 to 1980, it was 2.14%.  Thus, in GW’s best three years so far, growth rates exceeded those under Carter’s entire term by a little bit, and were less than under Clinton’s entire term.  I never saw a Republican refer to Carter’s performance as strong before.  (Carter inherited real problems.  Real GDP per capita had actually dropped a few times in the 1970s, there was an oil embargo, and the Bretton Woods system had fallen apart a few years earlier.)  GW has to keep up the performance of the past few years just to stay ahead of him.  (Real GDP per capita data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>)</p>
<p>2.  As I noted on my post on Myth 8, one could easily argue that the tax cuts in 2001 were of greater magnitude than the tax cuts of 2003.  After all, from 2000 to 2001, the tax rate on low income earners dropped by one third (from 15% to 10%), the tax rate on the top bracket dropped from 39.6% to 39.1%, and there was the $300 rebate.  In 2002, the highest tax rate dropped again, to 38.6%.  In 2003, the tax cut took the form of a reduction in top rates from 38.6% to 35%.  Why would the tax cuts of 2003 have a big effect, but not the tax cut of 2002, or the (arguably) larger tax cut of 2001?</p>
<p>3.  The economy tends to slowly rise no matter what inane policies are put in place by the folks in charge.  The surprise is not that the economy reacted after 2003.  The surprise is that things looked moribund for so long from 2001 to 2003.  </p>
<p>4.  Monetary policy.  Long time readers may recall I had a post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/monetarist-rule-and-fed.html">Federal Reserve’s policy</a>, by President.  I noted that GW’s term is one of only three (the other two being LBJ and Reagan) since 1950 which saw the Federal Reserve increase real M1 per capita.  This fairly unusual amount of monetary stimulus makes it even more surprising that the economy looked moribund from 2001 to 2003.</p>
<p>As always, if anyone wants my spreadsheets drop me a line.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________</p>
<p>Clarification&#8230; When I note &#8220;real GDP per capita from 2002 to 2006&#8221;, I assume the effect began in 2003.  Thus, I take into account the change from 2002 (presumably a bad year) to 2003 (presumably the good year).  Thus, I annualize the growth rate from from 2002 to 2003.  Similarly, for Clinton&#8217;s term, I look at the period from 1992 to 2000, and for Carter, from 1976 to 1980.  I should note&#8230;  using only data from 2003 to 2006 (i.e., assuming the 2003 tax cuts only affected 2004, 2005, and 2006), real growth per capita is 2.54%.  But at some point, we are cherry-picking, and GW doesn&#8217;t so good when you can cherry-pick other Presidents too.  For instance, 1998, 1999, and 2000, the years that arguably best demonstrated the Clinton policy, as by then it had the most chance to kick in, had real gdp per capita growth rates of 2.92%. Carter&#8217;s 3 best years occurred before the whole Iran mess&#8230;  3.34%!  It would be nice if any time between now and the end of GW&#8217;s term we see a 3 year stretch of 3.34% annualized growth in real GDP per capita, but nobody expects it.</p>
<p>Update&#8230; Corrected 1st sentence in point number 1.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, there are two Americas, but not the two that these tax-happy liberals keep talking about. The real two Americas are a taxpaying America and a non-tax paying America, according to Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Kudlow linked to <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&#038;status=article&#038;id=255313573617641">An Undertaxed America</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Each year, the Tax Foundation measures all taxation at the federal, state and local level as a percentage of income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow refers to Federal taxes – which incidentally include payroll contributions, which are paid by the working poor – and completely misses the fact most American pay state and local sales taxes.  But there is an odd contradiction in what he calls a good editorial:<br />
<blockquote>Despite the president&#8217;s tax cuts, America&#8217;s aggregate tax burden is historically high and rising &#8230; By the end of the Clinton administration, Americans&#8217; average tax burden had reached the historically unprecedented level of 33.6%. Under the current administration, the total tax burden has gotten as low as less than 30%. Since 2004, however, it&#8217;s rising again, standing now at 31.6%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since when does 31.6% exceed 33.6%?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve always suspected longtime reader OldVet of consorting with foreigners.  Sadly, my worst fears were confirmed just now, when he sent me this e-mail:</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>This morning I got the following email request from an entrepreneurial young Indian businessman from New Delhi :  </p>
<p>“Greetings from somewhere over Azerbaijan . I am on my way to Germany for a trade show and as a sign of gratitude for spending over $100,000 on tickets I was upgraded to the luxury of Business Class affording me an opportunity to read some of OldVet&#8217;s email and also let some of my creative juices flow.</p>
<p>For years I have been trying to figure out how we can offer our on-the-ground agribusiness marketing and development situation of India to the big boys &#8211; to folks with the investment money. I have spent almost 15 years doing consulting now but the money frankly is chicken feed. The money is in equity and people who can advise folks in picking equity. [Attaches an article from WSJ titled “The India Hot-Funds Quandry” of 2/4/2007, saying that financial talent available to foreign investors is in short supply.]</p>
<p>They key here is understanding our core capability. My partner Mr. A. and I jointly understand what is happening in the food and grocery sector. Till a few years ago it was basically what isolated investments are happening and where these would lead India as a country. In the past few years the situation has changes drastically. Due to the onset of big-time retail planning to come online &#8211; everyone is forcibly having to develop supply chain-linkages and makes investments upstream and downstream (and side-stream!). Venture money is there for the asking and equities are hitting the market big-time as you know only too well.</p>
<p>The questions is what can we bring to the table. We have a unique ability of being able to help folks sort the wheat from the chaff. We know what would work and what will not. We know mind-set of entrepreneurs who are developing these ventures. We understand their business practices (mostly no corporate governance standards) etc. In addition we observe, understand, analyze and appreciate change and how things fit together. That is always what has differentiated us in India &#8211; or ability to apply lessons from development examples from around the world to the Indian context.</p>
<p>My submission to you is that based on all this background experience we can offer a niche service to funds looking for opportunities in food and groceries and related businesses. The information would be high quality and not easily found in India .  What we lack &#8211; MBAs and related jargon which would let us come to Wall Street and sell ourselves. I know you are retired now and don&#8217;t want to work too hard &#8211; but this is right up your alley.   Please let me know your thoughts on this. “</p>
<p>I replied immediately:  </p>
<p>“ Now you&#8217;re talking!  Let me put my thinking cap on.  I had some ideas within minutes of your email and reading the article, but first ideas on what you or we can do are:  </p>
<p>(1)  Identifying merger and acquisition targets and doing on the ground evaluations for potential buyers such as Kroger, Ahold, Carrefour, Walmart, people like that.  This is very similar to #2 below, but on behalf of (a) individual foreign operating companies who want to branch into India .  You could even (b) hook up with foreign investment banks like Goldman Sachs, or Morgan Stanley, who have clients who want to move into India.  Or (c) hook up with McKinsey and Co. or Big 4 accounting firms, who have clients who want to invest directly in India in the food business.  (Money – make fees and expenses for the work, buy up shares of Indian stock or get a piece of the investment action from the buyer, and become a minority investor in the deal.  You get a chance at appreciating equity.)</p>
<p>(2) Doing &#8220;due diligence&#8221; inspections of companies in which the big Mutual Funds might want to invest, mainly Indian companies that are already public companies selling shares in India.  By this I mean a specialized consulting service in the food marketing industry, offered to foreign investors like Mutual Funds.  The &#8220;clients&#8221; in this case don&#8217;t want to run companies, or make direct investments &#8211; they just want to buy or sell stock based on the condition of the Indian companies in the food industry.  (Money – fees and expenses for doing the site visits and doing the management assessments, and getting a look at the financial books of the Indian firms.  Also, advance knowledge that stock is going to be bought, so you can get shares early.)</p>
<p>(3) Representing Indian companies who are looking for a foreign partner, such as a US retailer or food processor.  This is a &#8220;natural&#8221; for you!  Offer to bring in American companies for talks after doing a business and financial profile of the Indian company and shopping it around to contacts in the US .  (Money – daily fees and expenses, plus a fee of XX% of the investment that the Indian companies get from foreign investors.  Like 5% “finders fee” arrangement, or take a minority share of the new firm’s stock.)   More later, and have a nice flight.  “</p>
<p>Question:  What should I tell my ambitious young friend?</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>cactus here.  In response to some questions in the comment section, OldVet notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]his is absolutely for real. This is a real guy with ambition whom we&#8217;ve known for 20 years. I taught his daughter to drive at age 11, to my friend&#8217;s horror, in Tennessee on their last visit.</p>
<p>What can I do for this guy, who&#8217;s a good guy?&#8221;</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Kudlow, criticizing John Edwards, wrote <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDA2Nzc2MjMwYzQ3Yjk4YmFmYjMwM2RhZTlhZGUxMzE=">this</a>:</p>
<p>“Yes, there are two Americas, but not the two that these tax-happy liberals keep talking about. The real two Americas are a taxpaying America and a non-tax paying America, according to Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge.”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t want to get into whether John Edwards is a good candidate.  Perhaps that is a topic for another post.  Right now, my opinion of Edwards is simple – he’s one of a bunch of candidates on all ends of the political spectrum that all look pretty lousy to me, but I don’t find him to be any more offensive than any of the others either.  Perhaps if I had the time to pay a bit more attention right now, I’d find him either more or less offensive.</p>
<p>But I would like to look at those two Americas, the ones that Kudlow mentioned.  So I went found this <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/77xx/doc7718/EffectiveTaxRates.pdf">CBO report</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve included some summary tables from the CBO report at the bottom of this post.  Summary Table 1 showing Effective Federal Tax Rates for 2003 and 2004, and Summary Table 2 showing the Shares of Federal Tax Liabilities for 2003 and 2004 are reproduced below.  Income is comprehensive household income:  “pretax cash income plus income from other sources.”  All data from here on comes from those two tables.</p>
<p>Now, presumably, the top 10% of income earners and the bottom 20% of income earners are as good a representation of taxpaying and non-taxpaying America as we can find.</p>
<p>In 2004, the bottom 20%:  <br />&#8211; paid 0.9% of all federal taxes<br />&#8211; had an effective rate of 4.5%<br />&#8211; had a pre-tax income $15,400 and after tax income of $14,700</p>
<p>In 2004, the top 10%<br />&#8211; paid 52.3% of all federal taxes<br />&#8211; had an effective tax rate of 26.9%<br />&#8211; had a pre-tax income of $297,800 and an after tax income of $217,500.</p>
<p>So yeah, some people pay a lot of taxes and some people pay very little.  Why the difference?  Well, some might attribute it to differences in income.  They might say – well, some poor person, whether single or trying to head up a family, making $15,400 can’t afford to pay much in taxes.  Knock the cost of rent, utilities, food, transportation, and the cost of some clothing (notwithstanding how there’s always someone at the Corner who can point out you can get a very nice coat at the Salvation Army for $2) and what’s left?  Is there enough for health insurance?  </p>
<p>But people who think like that are fools.  Take a good look at the tables and you’ll spot the real difference.  See, the big difference boils down to the fact that the top 10% of income earners are paying a whopping 81.3% of corporate income taxes, while the lowest quintile is only paying 0.5%.  Clearly, those at the so-called bottom have better accountants and know how to defer their income to minimize the tax bite while those at the so-called top are just fools being taken for a ride by everyone else.  </p>
<p>Now, the solution is obvious.  Every so Kudlow ends up endorsing a national sales tax which <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200408050844.asp">he thinks</a> “would enhance productivity and grow the economy more rapidly, doubling national output over the next fifteen years.”  </p>
<p>Now, I’m sure this particular Kudlow analysis is worth as much as any other Kudlow analysis.  But I would prefer to note another reason why Kudlow would find a national sales tax to be desirable.  The effective tax rate on excise taxes for the top 10% of income earners is 0.4 percent, which is less than a fifth of the effective tax rate (2.1 percent) on excise taxes for the bottom 20% of income earners.  The top 1% do twice as well as that.  Clearly, the fact that the top income earners seem able to bypass these taxes more easily than the slovenly, not to say reprehensible poor makes them very attractive.  But I don’t understand – why stop with a national sales tax?  Why beat around the bush, so to speak?  Why not just tax poverty directly?  Imagine how fast the economy would run then!</p>
