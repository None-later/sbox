<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-defense5feb05,0,4529268.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Peter Siegel</a> should have fact checked the following:<br />
<blockquote>For more than a year, Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the outgoing Army chief of staff, has pointed out that defense spending accounts for about 3.8% of the gross domestic product &#8211; a figure that is projected to drop over the next five years, to near the lowest levels since World War II, even though the U.S. is involved in protracted fighting. He is calling for a wider national debate on whether that percentage should be significantly increased &#8211; and the chiefs of the Navy and Air Force said in interviews last week that they would publicly support that call in upcoming hearings on the defense budget. &#8220;In working that [budget] problem, I believe I&#8217;m seeing challenges that leads us to the notion that maybe it&#8217;s time to have this discussion about a higher percentage of GDP&#8221; devoted to defense, Air Force Gen. T. Michael &#8220;Buzz&#8221; Moseley said in a telephone interview during a trip to Afghanistan and Iraq. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very, very hard to get where we&#8217;re going as defined in the [Pentagon&#8217;s strategic plans] and to do this business on a global scale with the resources that we have.&#8221; Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen added: &#8220;At 3.8%, it just isn&#8217;t enough for the strategic appetite, and the strategic appetite is tied directly to the world we&#8217;re living in.&#8221; According to a senior Pentagon official, the Air Force alone is expected to tell Congress that it will need an additional $20 billion per year over the next five years, on top of the White House funding request, just to meet the strategic plans laid out by the Pentagon and the increasing demands resulting from the troop buildup in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010685.php">Kevin Drum</a> did fact check this:<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s about 4.9% of GDP. Add in other items that are routinely left out of the &#8220;Pentagon&#8221; budget even though they&#8217;re clearly part of our overall defense expenditures and you get a number well over 5% of GDP. Seems like a pretty fair chunk of change, doesn&#8217;t it? Though, no doubt, still not enough to sate the Pentagon&#8217;s &#8220;strategic appetite.&#8221; But what is?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin was referring to the FY2008 budget.  If one checks the GDP data in table 1.1.5 from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, it appears that General Schoomaker and Admiral Mullen’s 3.8% figure is a good description of defense spending relative to GDP for a year like 1998 but not for 2006.</p>

<blockquote>Single people with annual incomes over $80,000 and married couples with incomes over $160,000 already have to pay higher premiums for the part of Medicare that covers doctors’ services. The income thresholds rise with inflation. Budget cuments show that Mr. Bush will propose a similar surcharge on premiums for Medicare’s new prescription drug benefit. In addition, the president will ask Congress to “eliminate annual indexing of income thresholds,” so that more people would eventually have to pay the higher premiums.  The proposal, expected to raise $10 billion over the next five years, is one of many advanced by Mr. Bush in a $2.8 trillion budget that aims to eliminate the deficit by 2012.  In his budget request, Mr. Bush expresses alarm about what he calls “the unsustainable growth of federal entitlement programs,” and he proposes savings in Medicare and Medicaid that far surpass what he or any other president has sought.  The president contends that he can make the rule changes without any action by Congress. But Congress could try to block some or all of the changes &#8230; Administration officials said earlier this week that Mr. Bush would ask Congress to squeeze more than $70 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over five years. But the budget documents show that the actual figure is much larger: $101.5 billion of savings over five years &#8230; Lobbyists for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers plan a huge campaign to kill the president’s proposals, which they say will ultimately harm beneficiaries. Mr. Bush said his proposals would just slow the programs’ growth. “Our budget reduces Medicare’s average annual growth rate over five years to 5.6 percent, from 6.5 percent,” Mr. Bush said, while Medicaid would grow 7.1 percent a year, instead of 7.3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Clinton is quoted as saying this is the wrong approach to reducing the deficits while some Republicans are saying it is OK that the affluent pay more of their Medicare costs.  When the President claims this proposal will just slow the growth of spending, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/02/president_bush_proposes_phase.html#015367">Dean Baker</a> rebuts with:<br />
<blockquote>This means that over time, more and more of the senior population would have to pay premiums that largely cover the cost of their Medicare. In other words, Medicare will no longer be government provided health care for most of the elderly population. How fast will the benefits phase out? Well in roughly twenty years, the means-testing would be hitting singles who are the same point in the income distribution as someone earning $40,000 a year today, and couples earning $80,000. In forty years, the point at which Social Security is first projected to face a shortfall, the means-testing would be hitting singles who are at the same point in the income distribution as someone earning $20,000 a year today, and couples earning $40,000. In other words, under President Bush&#8217;s proposal many middle income elderly people would face the loss of their Medicare subsidy before Social Security faces any funding shortfall. A bit further out, and only the poor would still receive any subsidy through the Medicare program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – failure to index the nominal payments is the same thing as allowing gradual reduction in the real value of benefits.  If that is what the Republican Party wishes to do – let them just be honest about it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/02/how_to_balance_1.html">Menzie Chinn</a> sees that the White House is assuming that the cost of the Afghan and Iraq wars will fall to zero by 2010 as he points to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/04/AR2007020401174.html">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Administration officials also exclude some potentially expensive items. Their request, for the first time, attempts to show the true cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the coming fiscal year, $145 billion, but includes just $50 billion for fiscal 2009 and nothing thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, smoke and mirrors.  The same story plays out the silliness from certain free lunch supply-siders:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans countered that the tax cuts are critical to maintaining a healthy economy and that a balanced budget is not possible without them. Raising taxes &#8230;. won&#8217;t help balance the budget &#8211; it will slow the economic growth that is creating the new jobs of tomorrow and increasing revenue to the federal government,&#8221; House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) wrote in an essay distributed yesterday by his office. &#8220;Keeping our economy strong and promoting fiscal responsibility will get the job done. Raising taxes won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Golly gee – we haven’t seen an economy that continued to grow after we raised tax rates in such a long time.  After all, the 1990’s were so last century!</p>

                                <p>Reader OldVet sends a link to <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/cooke/2007/0202.html">an article on Ethanol prices</a>.  This is way outside my area of expertise, and I can&#8217;t vouch for the figures.  That said, I&#8217;ve always thought corn ethanol was a bad hoax perpetrated on the American public.  Ethanol from other sources, of course, can work.  It works in Brazil, but then sugar cane grows by itself on the side of the road like a weed, and sugar cane has plenty of sugar in it.  I&#8217;m the farthest thing one can find from a farmer, and pretty ignorant about agriculture in general, but corn just doesn&#8217;t seem to have that much sugar in it, it seems to require some effort to cultivate, and it doesn&#8217;t seem all that easy to extract.  And it doesn&#8217;t help that the folks at Archer Daniels Midland seems to get caught engaging in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland#Price_fixing_investigation">unfortunate behavior</a> from time to time.</p>

<p>Also, reader NS has given us an overview of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/reader-ns-view-of-riedls-10-myths.html">the Riedl approach</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Myth 7: &#8220;Myth #7: Reversing the upper-income tax cuts would raise substantial revenues.<br />Fact: The low-income tax cuts reduced revenues the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I think Riedl slipped up here, since I&#8217;m not sure the fact he brings up has anything to do with the myth. As per <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002819.html">MaxSpeak</a>, both the myth and the fact can be true simultaneously. </p>
<p>But let me change the story a bit. Let&#8217;s say we were discussing not tax revenues but rather spending. Now, there are any number of inane things in the budget that everyone except a handful of recipients of the cash would agree are wasteful. All of us, left and right could agree with that, and we could probably come up with a long list that just about every reader of this blog and just about every member of Heritage could agree upon. </p>
<p>Now, if someone tried to defend one of those items by stating &#8211; well, these other items on the list are even more costly, nobody would consider that to be much of a defense. Defending the proposition that upper-income tax cuts are a good thing is one thing, but saying its not a problem because other tax cuts caused even bigger reductions in income, whether true or not, is a non-sequitor.</p>

                                <p>I used to watch a lot of soccer &#8211; now I still watch around World Cup time, but my sports watching now seems limited to a once every four year extavaganza limited to however long it takes the South American teams to be eliminated, or, if there&#8217;s an interesting European player like Bergkamp out there, however long it takes for his team to drop out.</p>
<p>The Superbowl is on now.  I&#8217;m not watching.  I don&#8217;t have much interest in football.  But I have some thoughts about football.  They&#8217;ve been kicking around my head for a long time &#8211; so long, in fact, that it may be they&#8217;re not original and I actually read them somewhere.  So if I&#8217;m plagiarizing someone&#8217;s idea, my apologies &#8211; its inadvertent.  My thoughts center around the idea that football is the quintessential American sport.  A few features of football that make it the quintessential American sport:</p>
<p>1.  Everyone on the team is a specialist<br />2.  The people on the field don&#8217;t resemble people you see in normal life<br />3.  The action lasts only a few seconds at a time<br />4.  The action is repeated over and over, from a zillion angles<br />5.  Marketing is more important what actually happens on the field<br />6.  There is an insane number of rules, some quite technical<br />7.  In the end, the call made by the referees is often the most important thing in deciding who wins<br />8.  Somone gets sued for something silly.  This year (I&#8217;m too lazy to hunt for links right now), some megachurches were told to cancel their Superbowl parties by the NFL, which was concerned that it would drive down Nielsen ratings<br />9.  There&#8217;s a lot of beer drinking involved</p>

                                <p><a href="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/244lukra.asp">Noemie Emery</a> is ready to pounce on the Democrats in the unlikely event that Bush’s surge in Iraq turns out wonderful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Giddy with joy at their sudden good fortune, the Democrats have set out to embarrass the president, pushing resolutions of less-than-no-confidence, clubbing his Iraq surge plan as it lies in its cradle, and declaring defeat in advance. In some sense, they have achieved their objectives: They have embarrassed Bush, exposed his weakness, and won over a cadre of frightened Republicans. But they have also painted themselves into a number of corners, from which they may find it hard to escape. If Iraq is stabilized this side of chaos, the congressional Democrats will be remembered as the people who fought to prevent it, who tried to kneecap the commander and demoralize the armed forces, and all in all make the mission more difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite his dishonest claim that we Democrats oppose another Bush scheme destined to backfire only because we are more interesting in embarrassing the President than good policy – if Bush’s ill conceived plan actually works, we Democrats should tip our hat.  But does Noemie Emery really believe this nonsense?  Then explain what immediately followed in his op-ed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If, on the other hand, the surge is seen to fail, they will be the ones who made it more difficult, demoralized the armed forces, kneecapped the commander, and telegraphed to the enemy that our will was cracking, and we would shortly be leaving. The Democrats have also given Bush a partial alibi for a possible failure &#8211; he tried, but at a critical moment they threw in the towel. This argument would be plausible enough to attract support from a great many people.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010681.php">Kevin Drum</a> wants to cut in right here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over at the Weekly Standard, the magazine that provides the intellectual superstructure for hawkish neoconservatism, Noemie Emery provides the most straightforward version yet of the stab-in-the-back narrative that neocons plan<br />to lay on Democrats a few months from now &#8230; Why yes, it might be plausible enough to &#8220;attract support from a great many people&#8221;! It just might. But I wonder where all these people will get the idea in the first place? Such a wonderful invention, the passive voice, isn&#8217;t it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve given Kevin a chance to inject some commonsense, let’s get back to the pathetic rant of Noemie Emery:<br />
<blockquote>Had they let the surge play itself out, with best wishes but grave reservations, the Democrats could have gained a reputation for good will in any event, and for genuine prescience in the case of failure. But there is a difference between warning of failure ensues, it is no longer his fault, in its entirety. Now it is his fault &#8211; and theirs.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s wonderful.  We Democrats are supposed to just shut up and let the Blundering-in-Chief proceed with his incompetence.  Otherwise, we are to blame for his failures.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Charles Krauthammer had a piece that appeared in the National Review called <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTFhZGJiNWZjNzk2Zjg3N2YzODhmZDY0YWI3N2RiMmE=">Iraq’s choice</a>.  The premise is that Iraqis were given their freedom, and collectively they made a choice.  “They chose civil war.”  I’m not kidding.  Its this simple.  The choice, of course, leads to a situation in which “Arabs kill Arabs and Shiites kill Shiites and Sunnis kill all in a spasm of violence that is blind and furious.”  </p>
<p>Now, one might thing that not all of the Iraqis have chosen Civil War.  One might think that at least some have had violence imposed upon them like some massive negative externality.  But if Krauthammer feels that way, I’m not seeing it from his piece.  The closest he comes is one time writing that “many have chosen civil war.” But for the most part, the choice seems to be more, well, collective in Krauthammer&#8217;s piece.  But that’s about it.  He does write about opposition to the Civil War &#8211; in fact, close to a third of the piece seems to be about trying to reduce the violence.  But the only ones doing anything to reduce violence, from reading his piece, seem to be Americans.  But those Iraqis, they have made a choice, and denying that its an Iraqi choice “infantilizes Arabs.”</p>
<p>Which raises the question – for a guy like Krauthammer, who believes in free markets and choice – what is the justification for interfering with the choice of a bunch of individuals who have all collectively chosen to engage in Civil War?  What are American soldiers doing, interfering with the freedom of the Iraqis to butcher each other as they have chosen to do?  There have been so many incarnations of what is going on in Iraq according to folks like Krauthammer.  There was the cakewalk, then the last throes and the dead enders, and who can even count the corners that were turned?  And they&#8217;ve moved the goalposts so many times, redefined victory so many ways.  Along the way, anyone who noted discrepancies was tarred as a traitor and was giving aid to the enemy.  So if things don’t improve, and somehow, I don’t think they will (I have said before, I remember Reagan, GHW, and Clinton, but this crowd is qualitatively very different and not in a good way), what’s left for guys like Krauthammer?  Are they going to conclude that, well, we did the Iraqis a favor by giving them a choice that Saddam denied them, and look, they are better off now, happily acting upon their choice?</p>

<div>What point is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16928315">Tom Curry</a> trying to make? He starts off with pie charts for the 1954 Federal budget ($70.8 billion) and the 2006 budget ($2654 billion):</p>
<p>
<blockquote>You may be asking: “Are you sure you’ve got those pie charts labeled correctly?” You can see at the top of this story two charts, one depicting federal spending in 1954, the other one showing federal outlays last year. With wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on terrorists elsewhere around the globe, the taxpayer last year spent an astonishing amount of money on the military: about $500 billion. The budget proposal that President Bush unveils Monday won’t ultimately change the size of the slices in that budget pie chart very much. Spending on the military accounted for 19 cents of every dollar of federal expenditures in 2006. That might seem like a lot, until you consider the Cold War year of 1954. That year marked the post-World War II peak of military spending, measured as a percentage of total federal outlays. Nearly 70 percent of all federal expenditures in 1954 went to buy rockets, rifles, radar, and nuclear warheads and to pay the salaries of Americans in uniform. If you measure it another way, military spending in 1954 accounted for 13 percent of the total U.S. economic output (gross domestic product, or GDP). Today it accounts for about four percent of GDP, a decline of 70 percent since 1954.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was wondering when he’d get away from comparing nominal figures over a half century apart to looking at percentages of GDP. But he needs to check again – defense spending is closer to 5% of GDP than 4% of GDP. Now that’s a lot less than 13% but then we aren’t fighting the Cold War anymore.</p>
<p>Curry then goes onto talk about how expensive Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid are and ends his op-ed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bernanke said unless the entitlement programs are redesigned, federal debt will grow to a point where it “would spark a fiscal crisis, which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases, or both.” Senate Budget Committee chairman Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., is also sounding the alarm. “We’re heading for a circumstance in which all of federal spending will be consumed just by Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,” Conrad said Thursday. “There’d be nothing left for national parks, for highways, etc. That’s the outlook in the long term, if we fail to act. The conclusion one reaches is that we’re on a completely unsustainable course.” Such a dismal scenario might make one nostalgic for 1954.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would have been nice to also tell his readers that payroll taxes have been much higher since 1983 than they were in 1954. Since Mr. Curry failed to, we did in our graph.</p></div>

<p>Also, reader NS has given us an overview of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/reader-ns-view-of-riedls-10-myths.html">the Riedl approach</a>.</p>
<p>Moving on…</p>
<p>“Myth #6: Raising tax rates is the best way to raise revenue.<br />Fact: Tax revenues correlate with economic growth, not tax rates.”</p>
<p>Riedl is right about this.  But I’m not sure we agree on what this actually means.  Riedl goes on:</p>
<p>“Since revenues move with GDP, the common-sense way to increase tax revenues is to expand the GDP. This means that pro-growth policies such as low marginal tax rates (especially on work, savings, and investment), restrained federal spending, minimal regulation, and free trade would raise more tax revenues than would be raised by self-defeating tax increases.”</p>
<p>One minor quibble – presumably the idea is to grow real GDP per capita, not GDP, and I assume Riedl would agree.  But I have a problem with the idea that low marginal tax rates are necessarily “pro-growth.”  Consider… there are 50 states.  Residents of all of them live under the same Federal Tax System, but different state tax systems.  Even with each state, tax burdens change with time.  Now, we always read about how some state or other that cut taxes has been growing rapidly for the last ten years or so.  But… there are some states that historically – for many decades – have had historically high tax burdens.  One can name them – New York, Taxachussetts, California, and so forth.  And there are some states that have historically – for many decades &#8211; had low tax burdens.  Its also easy to compile that list – Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, etc.  And through all this time, which states have been driving this country?  Is the end goal to make us more like Alabama than Massachusetts?  </p>
<p>Now, a conservative might respond – well, there are historical reasons for that inequity.  Sure, but the historical reasons include the infrastructure built up by the taxes that have been paid in Massachusetts and have not been paid in Alabama.  And besides, this has been going on for a long time – how long does it take for people to vote with their feet and for people and businesses to migrate from the high tax hellholes to the low tax nirvanas – ten years?  Twenty?  Fifty?  One hundred?  The difference between Alabama and Massachusetts has been around for a very long time.  </p>
<p>That is not to say that simply raising taxes is the way to go.  As with everything else, the question is one of balance.  Cut taxes too much, shrink government too much, and you don’t have enough infrastructure.  Raise taxes too much, increase government too much, and you stagnate the private sector.  The question is – what is too high and what is too low.  I’ve covered some of that at various times and it may come up again in the context of the other Riedl myths.</p>
