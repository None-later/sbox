<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting when the same incident can arouse both dismay and satisfaction at the same time.  One such incident is today&#8217;s release of a new tape from Osama bin Laden, in which he mocks the United States and calls for their citizens to convert to Islam.  Or so I understand from the news coverage I&#8217;ve been hearing.</p>
<p>My dismay arises from my certainty that this ham-handed taunt will have just the effect that Osama probably wants &#8212; pushing the United States government back into the mud wrestling pit of doomed and expensive military actions, and pushing US citizens back into making automatic and unintelligent decisions about who should lead their country and how those people should act.</p>
<p>My satisfaction comes from having predicted this in 2001 when the Afghan war began.</p>
<p>You see, in early 2002 I wrote an essay comparing the 9/11 attacks to the skillful and focused activities of a bullfighter.  Normally a human being, lacking fangs, armor, claws and other weapons of retail destruction, is not much of a match against an enraged bull 10 times his size.  But when handled with the right techniques, the bull doesn&#8217;t stand a chance against the bullfighter.</p>
<p>In one precise stroke the 9/11 attacks, which killed about as many people as a die in US automobile accidents every month, or die of cancer every two days, the 9/11 attackers induced to the United States into a series of actions so out of proportion to the insult that it can only be viewed metaphorically as the action of a picador enraging the bull.</p>
<p>In Spanish type bullfighting, the lone bullfighter doesn&#8217;t ever go into the ring until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picador">picadors</a> have planted several barbed lances into the muscles of his shoulders.   This weakens the bull with blood loss, enrages him and makes it hard for him to think, and causes him to lower his head.  This is necessary because the final stroke of the sword which kills the bull typically goes over the shoulders and down into the heart of the bull &#8212; a<br />stroke which would probably be much more difficult if the bull had his head up watching the bullfighter.</p>
<p>Long before the bull ever enters the ring, another factor acts to weaken him in the face of his opponent &#8212; fighting bulls are carefully kept from any contact with human beings so that they will not learn how to effectively oppose them.  Fighting bulls are never taught how to fight &#8212; quite the opposite.</p>
<p>In the light of that metaphor, look at the United States administration as they have behaved over the past six years.  They have poured their wealth and their people without discrimination into a war which everyone knew could not be won.  In  Afghanistan they have not succeeded in the one or two items which were necessary to be accomplished &#8212; the capture of bin Laden and the weakening or destruction of the Taliban.  And as for the wholehearted descent into rage and unreason and an outright refusal to act sensibly instead of passionately &#8212; this is probably the dynamic which will have the most long-term damage to the United States people and government.</p>
<p>And now, the picador is on his horse again.  This time he doesn&#8217;t need an airplane, he doesn&#8217;t need adherents (although he has plenty, thanks to US activities worldwide) he doesn&#8217;t need to circumvent customs lines, he doesn&#8217;t even have to buy an airline ticket.  All he has to do is make one videotape and hand it over, in order to see the United States (I very much fear) rouse up again in a frothing fury, abandon any fragments of returning common sense, and continue to pour out the lifeblood of their children in efforts which cannot be successful.</p>
<p>What can the USA do to counter such tactics?  For a change, the US must act dispassionately and cost-effectively, stop throwing their substance away, and back away from the brink of disaster &#8212; if they&#8217;ve not gone over it already.</p>
<p>Whether or not the bullfighter is gored in the end, a bullfight always ends the same way.  The only solution is for the bull to refuse the rules of the game imposed by his opponent, keep his head up, and learn as much as he can about his prospective enemies before they approach them with their brightly colored spears.</p>

<blockquote>KATHMANDU (Reuters) &#8211; Officials at Nepal&#8217;s state-run airline have sacrificed two goats to appease Akash Bhairab, the Hindu sky god, following technical problems with one of its Boeing 757 aircraft, the carrier said Tuesday.<br />Nepal Airlines, which has two Boeing aircraft, has had to suspend some services in recent weeks due the problem.<br />The goats were sacrificed in front of the troublesome aircraft Sunday at Nepal&#8217;s only international airport in Kathmandu in accordance with Hindu traditions, an official said.<br />&#8220;The snag in the plane has now been fixed and the aircraft has resumed its flights,&#8221; said Raju K.C., a senior airline official, without explaining what the problem had been.<br />Local media last week blamed the company&#8217;s woes on an electrical fault. The carrier runs international flights to five cities in Asia.<br />It is common in Nepal to sacrifice animals like goats and buffaloes to appease different Hindu deities.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Where&#8217;s the door? Where am I? What&#8217;s going on here?</p>
<p>Normally, I avoid calling attention to Bush&#8217;s gaffs, but the latest are ironic howlers. More importantly, they led me to think more seriously about what has gone wrong these past eight years. What principle governs us as a nation? Who is our leader? How does he think? Although a leader cannot be held accountable for everything that goes wrong, he certainly creates the ethos that makes some things possible and some things impossible. So it must be with GW. With GW, it is, I think his simplicity, his &#8220;personal touch,&#8221; his unflagging vision of a Manichean world that has brought us to where we are.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Bush blundered at the APEC summit in Australia. Last night I saw those blunders in all their comic glory on Canadian t.v. If you need a text description, you can find a text description on<br /><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/07/world/main3242274.shtml">CBS News</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Curiously, I did not find the howlers in The New York Times or in the Washington Post, two papers I religiously read every morning. But then, I may have missed them.</p>
<p>At first, he confused the APEC summit with OPEC. Ironic? (The APEC summit was supposed to discuss global warming.) Oil, Iraq, and the War on Terror is all that Bush can think about. His blunders tell all.</p>
<p>Then he thanked Prime Minister Howard for sending Austrian troops to Iraq. The ironies do multiply. (Think Austrian troops in WWII.)</p>
<p>Then, when exiting the stage he went the wrong way. (Sorry, no door there!) He had to be gently guided to the appropriate exit. This is not the first time when the exit has befuddled our president. Perhaps arrows should be painted on the floor. Nonetheless, these gaffs do show the issues that really concern Bush. And, despite his efforts, there will be no easy exit from global warming.</p>
<p>Of course, the blogs have had enormous fun with Bush&#8217;s antics on the world stage. Remember how Gerald Ford&#8217;s stumble off the plane perhaps cost him the election and gave rise to the comment: Can&#8217; walk and chew gum at the same time? Where has the press been with GW?</p>
<p>When I think back over the long history of gaffs and idiocies, not only verbal but physical (massaging the German Chancellor, for example), I am speechless. But then Bush likes the &#8220;personal touch.&#8221; Putin looked like such a pussycat when first Bush met him. &#8220;My kind of guy.&#8221; What&#8217;s wrong with this picture? Naive people rely on feelings, not on intelligence. Intuition completely substitutes for knowledge and thought.</p>
<p>I think back to the run-up to GW&#8217;s first election: David Gergen claimed we did not need an informed president. Good advisors will help him along. Then we got Cheney. And Gergen, whom I once admired, is still trotted forth as a learned commentator. I would love to ask Gergen to defend himself. Harvard professors are supposed honor intelligence, or so I thought.</p>
<p>I wonder what George Will really thinks of George? What do any of our so-called pundits seriously think about GW? If he were not president, would they invite him over for a serious discussion of world issues?</p>
<p>This has been a disastrous eight years: Iraq, global warming forgotten, denied; a misguided energy policy; trade policy that looks the other way as Mattel, Intel, and others reap fortunes off cheap labor; misguided tax cuts; protection of the wealthiest; gay, homophobic Republicans&#8230;hypocrisy that seems to have no limits&#8230; Everywhere corporate interests are protected. Fox News leads the patriotic charge. But Murdock is certainly willing to do what is necessary to get business in repressive China.</p>
<p>Fear, fear is the rivet that holds all this nonsense together. Always we hear about the War on Terror, an endless war, a war that will never end. Bush named it. That simple phrase now governs our thinking and our actions. Who we have for a leader does matter.</p>
<p>Fear has been tapped. All the politicians know it. Not to be appropriately fearful is not to be appropriately patriotic. Super patriotism and Fear go hand in hand. Shamelessly every politician now must use it. It is a great voter-getter, right, Guilliani?</p>
<p>And now that this monster from Pandora&#8217;s box has been released, who will stand against it? Who will not join its ranks? In addition to super patriotism, what other questionable virtues has fear release?</p>
<p>In his simplicity and foolishness, Bush released it. Why? Because he has little capacity to think deeply or with any complexity. Simple truisms are all he knows. Black and white; Good and Evil. Fear permits stupidity. You will glory in watching your enemies be humiliated and destroyed. Fear permits barbarity.</p>
<p>How else do we explain Abu Grav? or Guantanamo? or extraordinary renditions? or the fear that the institution of the family itself is at risk? Cast your enemy as Evil incarnate; call forth the demon Fear. War then is holy; any action is then justifiable. The only release from fear is the glorious destruction of everything you have named as evil. It does have a Messianic ring to it.</p>
<p>And how does Fear respond to a crisis at home. What happened, for example, with Katrina? A few shots were fired, rumors of rapes abounded. Rescue efforts slowed. Properly armed militia had to be circumspect; they had to be properly fearful. The specter of fear imprisoned those wretched in the Superdome. Meanwhile, news media and politicians came and went&#8230;unhindered. People sat and waited in squalor. Was anyone murdered? Raped? Any arrests? “Great job, Brownie.” Fear destroys compassion and selflessness.</p>
<p>When fear rules, you are for us or against us. No wonder Bush treasures personal loyalty above all else. In a Manichean world, loyalty is the ultimate virtue. Cronyism is the consequence. Knowledgeable people are suspect. Everyone must be on the president’s page regardless of qualifications. Rove knows. He was the dark manager who ensured everyone spoke with the same voice.</p>
<p>But then there are the cronies who cash in on &#8220;the action.&#8221; Not only cronies’ benefit, but also large institutions profit as well. Media ratings rise on every fear alarm. Money is to be made in Iraq and elsewhere. Thank you, Haliburton. Meanwhile, Americans will not see how their pockets are being picked, how slowly but surely their liberties are being eroded.</p>
<p>Yes, we have quite a president. Like it or not, we have all become GW&#8217;s. We easily forgive his blunders. We easily overlook his stupidity. We treat with reverence his style of thought. We are all afraid less we be called unpatriotic. Reminds me of Richard Rogers&#8217; old ditty: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be taught to hate and to fear. You got to taught from year to year.&#8221;</p>
<p>I honestly do not think that Bush has a clue as to what he has done or how he has been used.</p>
<p>As I said, simple truisms are his bread and butter. Everything is Black and White. Good and evil. Personal loyalty, not knowledge or discernment, is now the requisite for advancement in Washington. The best and brightest shamelessly have played the game. Those who have spoken out are soon forgotten. </p>
<p>Mindless fear governs all. </p>
<p>The thinking mind has left Washington.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/us/politics/07thompson.html?ex=1346817600&#038;en=9ed5689f8882a4a9&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Susan Saulny</a> uses GOP approached spin to discuss how Fred Thompson might tackle the deficit problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>He also signaled that he would try to rein in ballooning entitlement costs. “The politicians have been quite busy, quite busy, spending the next generations’ money,” he said, adding later: “We need to deliver a message to Washington that we’re better than that. And you can start delivering that message by electing a president who will blow the whistle on this lack of responsibility. And I’m the guy who will do that.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=would_fred_thompson_cut_social">Dean Baker</a> writes with more clarity: </p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security and Medicare are enormously important to the health and economic security of tens of millions of citizens. If a central theme of Mr. Thompson&#8217;s campaign is that he wants to cut these programs, then the media should make this fact clear to the public. In comparison to plans to cut these programs, almost anything else that the media might say about Thompson is trivial. Political reporters should devote their efforts to clarifying Mr. Thompson&#8217;s position on Social Security and Medicare rather than worrying about his similarities with Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can understand why a true fiscal conservative might wish to cut Federal spending rather than the Faustian choice of raising tax rates or watching deferred tax obligations balloon.  But let’s be clear – this GOP proposal amounts to either: (1) eliminating that Prescription Drug Benefit that George Bush loves to brag about, or (2) taking away what you thought were your payroll contributions to your future Social Security retirement benefits.  But what else is left when one considers the future DoD budgets that would be necessitated from this neocon nonsense:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his debut speech as an official contender for the Republican nomination, Mr. Thompson appeared before a crowd here and seemed more animated than usual, gesticulating with a closed fist at a lectern as he spoke of radical Islam, porous national borders and what he described as ineffective government bureaucracies in Washington. More than anything, he said he was concerned about “national safety” and its effect on the kind of world his young children would inherit. That is what prompted him to run, he said. “My friends, if we show weakness and division, we will pay a heavy price for it in the future,” Mr. Thompson said. “We must show the determination that we are going to be united as the American people and do what is necessary to prevail not only in Iraq but in the worldwide conflict that lies beyond Iraq.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the new supply-side silliness is that more DoD spending will lead to faster growth, more revenues, and deficit reduction?  Spend&#038;spend and Borrow&#038;borrow.</p>

After all, Donald Luskin is Paul’s internet stalker and it seem Luskin’s Mini Me is stalking me as in a comment to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/august-employment-report.html">this post</a>.  The comment simply plucked the following from the BLS report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The declines were largely due to a drop in labor force participation among teenagers</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – all that hard work that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/job-growth-ends.html">Frank</a> did to provide us with a graph of how weak job growth has been going on for a while is bogus because workers between the ages of 16 and 19 really don’t count in certain rightwing circles.</p>
<p>Now it is true that the decline in the employment-population ratio from the 63.4% mark in December to the 62.8% mark in August was in part due to the fact this ratio for the teenagers dropped from 36.8% to 33.3%.  While I would argue this matters too, our favorite troll is too lazy and/or too stupid to check what happened to the employment-population ratio for us older ones (ages 20 and up).  You see it dropped from 65.5% in December to 65.1% in August. </p>
<p>But why should I expect our favorite troll to know the facts or to make a real point?  He hasn’t yet.  Which is why he is the perfect Mini Me for the Stupidest Man Alive.</p>

One quote, readily accesible via goggle, is “One number is not a trend, but this will scare the Fed.&#8221; Come on folks, the decline has been going on for more than two years. I guess it depends on your frame of reference. Here&#8217;s a quick chart update.</p>

                                <p>A question&#8230; if figures for violence in Iraq <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/this-has-appeared-in-various-places-but.html">don&#8217;t include car bombings</a>, would they include situations in which 19 people hijacked four passenger planes and flew them into buildings? The reason I ask&#8230;</p>
<p>1. If 9/11 was so important that it <em>changed everything</em> (as many people put it) in the US, should violence statistics for Iraq be constructed in such a way as to ignore 9/11 type events?<br />2. If on the other hand, such an event was counted in the violence figures for Iraq, how can car bombings not be counted?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Real GDP in 2007QII was only 1.9 percent higher than it was as of 2006QII.  So what does this mean to the labor market?  The latest from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a> has come out: </p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged (-4,000) in August, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.6 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Over the last 3 months, total payroll employment changes have averaged 44,000 per month and private sector employment changes have averaged 72,000 per month (as revised).  In August, employment in manufacturing, construction, and local government education declined, while job growth continued in health care and food services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – this drop in employment continues this recent trend in weak employment growth.  But that’s the payroll survey and isn’t the fact that the unemployment rate remains at 4.6% great?  Well, the BLS explains why this standard rightwing canard is full of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>In August, the civilian labor force edged down to 152.9 million, and the labor force participation rate decreased to 65.8 percent.  The declines were largely due to a drop in labor force participation among teenagers; their participation rate fell to 39.7 percent.  Total employment (145.8 million) and the employment-population ratio (62.8 percent) were little changed over the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have noted before that the employment to population ratio, which was 63.4% as of December 2006, has declined over the course of this year dropping to 63% as of July 2007.  Now we see that this ratio has dropped to 62.8%. It would seem that the steady unemployment rate is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has declined as well – from 66.4% as of December to 65.8% as of August.  </p>
<p>So is there is silver lining?  Maybe this will encourage the FED to lower interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: CNN just had Ali Velshi on to explain to us what the employment report really means.  He starts off saying he was surprised that employment actually fell.  And then he touted the unemployment rate as being evidence that the labor market is really not that bad.  Can this man be more stupid?  So what are his qualifications to report on economic news?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Velshi">This source</a> claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ali Velshi earned a degree in religion from Queen’s University</p></blockquote>
<p>And CNN thinks Velshi is their best person to report on economics?  Figures from the organization that puts Sanjay Gupta up as an expert on health economics.</p>

<blockquote><p>Intelligence analysts computing aggregate levels of violence against civilians for the NIE puzzled over how the military designated attacks as combat, sectarian or criminal, according to one senior intelligence official in Washington. &#8220;If a bullet went through the back of the head, it&#8217;s sectarian,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;If it went through the front, it&#8217;s criminal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Drum also cites <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2007/09/getting-shot-in.html">Ilan Goldenberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So to recap. The violence numbers do not include: 1) Sunni on Sunni violence. 2) Shi&#8217;a on Shi&#8217;a violence 3) Car bombs 4) Getting shot in the front of the head.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If these reports are accurate, this is cherry-picking and parsing of so high a quality I am convinced the military must have hired <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Thomas Sowell</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~markhessel1/">Mark Hessel</a> sends a few questions and some answers&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is the rate of inflation?</strong> <br />I realize that prices are always going up, but shouldn&#8217;t inflation be based on some type of average or median income. In other words, shouldn&#8217;t the rate of inflation be based on what I can buy for an hour of my work? </p>
<p>The 7th amendment in the US constitution deals with civil law suits. </p>
<blockquote><p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>What is $20 dollars worth today as compared to 1800 &#8211; quickly checking, it&#8217;s about $327. [1] How long did an average US worker take to make $20 in 1800 and how long does it take today to make $327? </p>
<p>I would assume that it took longer in 1800 to make $20 than it takes someone today to make $327 dollars. So in real terms, inflation has gone down since 1800. </p>
<p><strong>Does GDP include money made off the stock market and what does that mean in terms of real growth or productivity increases? </strong><br />I believe that it should be included in any GDP statement. Money earned. Money taxed.</p>
<p>But, what exactly does money made off the stock market mean? Did it really increase productivity? How does that affect inflation or what my real hourly wages are? </p>
<p>It seems to me that it would create real inflation in terms of wages, my hour of work would buy less because there would be more money with nothing real in terms of output except more money. </p>
<p><strong>Shouldn&#8217;t any formula that predicts real growth be dependant on population size and productivity? </strong></p>
<p>I know this sounds a bit Marxists, but isn&#8217;t real growth in the world now totally dependent on population size and productivity? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been almost 80 years since a real world depression. The world has integrated into an economic whole. Forgoing a catastrophic world disaster, i.e. global warming, an asteroid, another world war, etc., the world will economically chug along it&#8217;s merry way with it&#8217;s chaotic ups and downs. </p>
<p>I still think we can screw things up. I think global warming and population growth are huge, but even smaller things may cause unforeseen outcomes. </p>
<p>For instance, I recently heard that China is running into a labor market shortage because of their one child per couple mandate. How is China going to handle that?</p>
<p>What are the consequences of consistently under rating the real inflation rate? (Which is apparently what the FED has been doing since I don&#8217;t know when. Wouldn&#8217;t this would cause the FED to lose money in the long run. Shouldn&#8217;t the FED be<br />pegging the rate as closely as possible to just above the real inflation rate?)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit scared by the current Administration and how economic information is being release to the public. If they were incompetent enough to cherry pick information to go to war with Iraq, if they were deceptive enough to use the Justice Department and apparently most of the other Executive departments for political purposes, why wouldn&#8217;t they try to jigger the economic reports</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>cactus here&#8230; this post was by Mark Hessel. I&#8217;d try to take a stab at these questions, but I got up way too late. So I&#8217;m throwing it open to the readers. Have at it.</p>
