                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092301431.html">Washington Post</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Pentagon group has encouraged some U.S. military snipers in Iraq to target suspected insurgents by scattering pieces of &#8220;bait,&#8221; such as detonation cords, plastic explosives and ammunition, and then killing Iraqis who pick up the items, according to military court documents.</p>
<p>The classified program was described in investigative documents related to recently filed murder charges against three snipers who are accused of planting evidence on Iraqis they killed. </p>
<p>&#8220;Baiting is putting an object out there that we know they will use, with the intention of destroying the enemy,&#8221; Capt. Matthew P. Didier, the leader of an elite sniper scout platoon attached to the 1st Battalion of the 501st Infantry Regiment, said in a sworn statement. &#8220;Basically, we would put an item out there and watch it. If someone found the item, picked it up and attempted to leave with the item, we would engage the individual as I saw this as a sign they would use the item against U.S. Forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In documents obtained by The Washington Post from family members of the accused soldiers, Didier said members of the U.S. military&#8217;s Asymmetric Warfare Group visited his unit in January and later passed along ammunition boxes filled with the &#8220;drop items&#8221; to be used &#8220;to disrupt the AIF [Anti-Iraq Forces] attempts at harming Coalition Forces and give us the upper hand in a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eugene Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military Justice, said such a baiting program should be examined &#8220;quite meticulously&#8221; because it raises troubling possibilities, such as what happens when civilians pick up the items.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a country that is awash in armaments and magazines and implements of war, if every time somebody picked up something that was potentially useful as a weapon, you might as well ask every Iraqi to walk around with a target on his back,&#8221; Fidell said. </p>
<p>Soldiers said that about a dozen platoon members were aware of the program, and that numerous others knew about the &#8220;drop items&#8221; but did not know their purpose. Two soldiers who had not been officially informed about the program came forward with allegations of wrongdoing after they learned they were going to be punished for falling asleep on a sniper mission, according to the documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Members of the sniper platoon have said they felt pressure from commanders to kill more insurgents because U.S. units in the area had taken heavy losses. The sniper unit &#8212; dubbed &#8220;the painted demons&#8221; because of the use of tiger-stripe face paint &#8212; often went on missions into hostile areas to intercept insurgents going to and from hidden weapons caches.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our job out here to lay people down who are doing bad things,&#8221; Spec. Joshua L. Michaud testified in Iraq in July, discussing the unit&#8217;s numerous casualties. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to call it revenge, but we needed to find a way so that we could get the bad guys the right way and still maintain the right military things to do.&#8221; </p>
<p>Within months of the program&#8217;s introduction, three snipers in Didier&#8217;s platoon were charged with murder for allegedly using those items and others to make shootings seem legitimate. Though it does not appear that the three alleged shootings were specifically part of the classified program, defense attorneys argue that the program may have opened the door to the soldiers&#8217; actions because it blurred the legal lines of killing in a complex war zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, much of this info comes from defense attorneys, and thus it may or may not be true.  My own personal belief is that this program, or something very, very similar exists.  War is not pretty and this doesn&#8217;t seem outlandish given some of the things we&#8217;ve already seen.  That said, a few thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  In my neighborhood &#8211; Silver Lake, about ten minutes by surface street from downtown LA, there are people who go by scavenging in garbage cans every day.  There&#8217;s an elderly Japanese woman, a homeless Black man, and a few hardworking Central American guys who would be the first to have their heads blown off if something like this happened around here &#8211; assuming one of the kids didn&#8217;t get to it first.</p>
<p>2.  I imagine most adults who saw a banana clip for an AK-47 on the street would pick it up.  Of course, with a program like this going, they wouldn&#8217;t get the chance to call the cops in order to turn it in.</p>
<p>3.  If a cop saw a banana clip for an AK-47 on the street, he/she would pick it up.  </p>
<p>4.  If there is any group of people even more likely than the average person or scavenger or cop or child to pick up a banana clip for an AK-47 they saw on the street, its an NRA member. </p>
<p>5.  Iraq is awash with guns.  As a result, everyone can use a banana clip for an AK-47, if for no other reason than putting it into the family&#8217;s AK-47 and using it to protect one&#8217;s family.  (Aren&#8217;t we encouraging people to fight the insurgents and criminal gangs?)</p>

<blockquote><p>I changed my mind in 2002 and 2003, largely because the whole notion of which fundamentally got me in favor of significant tax cuts without offsetting expenditures was a very special event which probably had not occurred in the United States for 150 years &#8212; namely, division of our total federal debt effectively going to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am sure Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s interviews will be popular, but the quote above was in relation to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and his fear of <a href="http://www.cedarcomm.com/~stevelm1/usdebt.png">surpluses</a>.</p>
<p>Could someone explain to me how 6 trillion in debt could be paid down to zero in a short time frame (a decade or two?, eight years?)? He does not mention the mild recession.   I believe cactus has a chart somewhere as well, but I will find it later.</p>

                                <p>I’ve had posts in which I tried to rank Presidents by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Economic Growth</a> and by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">Fiscal Responsibility</a>.  This post ranks Presidents by something closer to income – how the average American fared economically during each President’s tenure.  </p>
<p>One measure of how well Americans are doing is real median income.  A graph real median income and how it has changed over time is available <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">here</a>.  A summary of the growth rates is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjfLL0VLI/AAAAAAAAAuA/rbUZ3L6D754/s1600-h/real+median+income+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjfLL0VLI/AAAAAAAAAuA/rbUZ3L6D754/s320/real+median+income+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What do we see?  Well, JFK/LBJ came out tops, followed by Clinton, then Reagan, and in fourth, Ike, with a big gap between each one.  The rest of the Presidents all had negative growth… GW was the least offensive of these, followed by Nixon/Ford, then GHW, and Carter brought up the rear.  Despite Carter&#8217;s dismal performance, on average, the Democratic Presidents did better than the Republican Presidents.</p>
<p>But while that shows how much income for the representative American earner has changed over time, it’s not an end-all be all measure.  It would be nice to know how much this person takes home after taxes.  And because some Presidents <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">drove up the debt</a> (cough cough, Reagan, cough, GW), a smart person knows that they have to pay more in taxes some time in the future in order to pay for that debt.  Thus, it would be nice to have the change in real disposable (i.e., after tax) median income less that person’s future tax obligations.  Since that isn’t available, we do the next best thing – we look at real disposable per capita income and subtract off the change from one year to the next in the real national debt per capita.  A graph of that series is available <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">here</a>, and changes over the term of each President are shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjZrL0VKI/AAAAAAAAAt4/DqxMyDiQMtI/s1600-h/real+disposable+income+less+the+change+in+debt+per+capita+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjZrL0VKI/AAAAAAAAAt4/DqxMyDiQMtI/s320/real+disposable+income+less+the+change+in+debt+per+capita+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>By this measure, the top three are Clinton, Carter, and JFK/LBJ.  Reagan follows at a distance, then Nixon/Ford, then Ike, with the Bush leaguers way at the bottom.  It goes without saying that Democratic Presidents outperformed Republican Presidents by this measure.</p>
<p>What about the folks at the bottom, namely the poor?  Here’s a graph showing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-poverty-rate.html">poverty</a> over time.  A summary (leaving out Ike, for whom there was only two years of data) appears below:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjUrL0VJI/AAAAAAAAAtw/CLrjjU8so78/s1600-h/percentage+of+people+in+poverty+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjUrL0VJI/AAAAAAAAAtw/CLrjjU8so78/s320/percentage+of+people+in+poverty+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>JFK/LBJ (think War on Poverty) did by far the best job of reducing poverty, followed by Clinton, followed distantly by Nixon/Ford.  Reagan broke even.  Poverty increased by 2.2% a year under GW, almost 2.45% a year under Carter, and 3.3% a year under GHW.  On this measure as well, on average, Democrats did better than Republicans.  Under Democrats, poverty decreased.  Under Republicans, it increased.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of these measures by themselves is a good summary of what’s happening on the income front.  The first measure looks at the average individual, but doesn’t take into account taxes or future taxes.  The second does take into account taxes and future tax obligations, but being an average, is skewed toward high income individuals.  The third only looks at the poor.  </p>
<p>So a good ranking of how well people fared should take into account all three of the above measures.  Here’s my way of creating that ranking…</p>
<p>1.  for all presidents except Ike, weighted sum of rankings = [(rank by measure 1/8) + (rank by measure 2/8) + (rank by measure 3/7)]/3<br />2.  for Ike, weighted sum of rankings  = [(rank by measure 1/8) + (rank by measure 2/8)]/2</p>
<p>(The difference, of course, is because Ike can’t be ranked by the third measure.)</p>
<p>The lower the weighted sum of rankings, the better.  Results are shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjPLL0VII/AAAAAAAAAto/a32vk0Wn4gs/s1600-h/Personal+Income,+Weighted+Rankings.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvhjPLL0VII/AAAAAAAAAto/a32vk0Wn4gs/s320/Personal+Income,+Weighted+Rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>JFK/LBJ and Clinton were essentially tied for first, with Reagan coming a distant third.  Nixon/Ford came next, with Ike at about the same level.  Carter followed – one can give GW the benefit of the doubt and say he was about as good as GW at this particular measure.  The elder Bush brings up the rear.  </p>
<p>Not surprisingly given that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Democrats outperformed Republicans on economic growth</a>, on average Democrats also did better when it came to increasing personal income.</p>

                                <p>Don’t you hate that expression “9/11 changed everything” – especially when it is (ab)used to justify some rightwing nutcase idea?  <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/053926.php">Steve Benen</a> watched Rudy’s performance at the NRA so we don’t have to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given his record, Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s pitch to the National Rifle Association is a tough one. He&#8217;s referred to the group&#8217;s members as &#8220;extremists&#8221;; he&#8217;s fought the group on the assault-weapons ban; and he filed a federal lawsuit as mayor against the nation&#8217;s gun manufacturers for violent crimes involving firearms. Indeed, he&#8217;s blasted the gun industry as one that &#8220;profits from the suffering of innocent people.&#8221; &#8230; Yesterday, Giuliani backed away from the lawsuit, saying he might not uphold it if he were a judge. &#8220;That lawsuit has taken several turns and several twists that I don&#8217;t agree with,&#8221; he said, without going into specifics. &#8220;I also think that there are some major intervening events &#8211; September 11, which cast somewhat of a different light on the Second Amendment, doesn&#8217;t change it fundamentally but perhaps highlights the necessity of it.&#8221; &#8230; Asked to explain the shift, a campaign spokesperson said Giuliani was &#8220;making a point that personal rights such as the 2nd Amendment are even more critical in a post-September 11th world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe not all of our personal rights as explained by <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/09/giuliani-again-.html">Brendan Nyhan</a> who documents that RUDY would ban certain kinds of criticisms of certain public figures.  So – 9/11 made it more important to protect the rights of individuals to carry weapons but it also made it less important to protect the right of free expression.  I see!</p>

<blockquote><p>June 22, 2007</p>
<p>BAGHDAD &#8212; Iraqi leaders beginning a weeklong China visit are hinting at reigniting a Saddam-era oil deal, though such a move is clouded by Iraq&#8217;s stalled oil law.</p>
<p>President Jalal Talabani this week is leading a delegation that includes the oil minister and four other cabinet members, the first Iraqi head of state visit to China since diplomatic ties were set up in 1958, China Daily reports. &#8220;We encourage Chinese enterprises to join the multinational competition for exploration of Iraqi oilfields,&#8221; said Mohammed Sabir Ismail, Iraq&#8217;s ambassador to China. </p>
<p>The visit will encompass a spectrum of economic meetings, but with Iraq oil sales making up 93 percent of the federal budget and in deep need of investment, the petroleum sector is likely to top the bill. Iraq produces only 2 million barrels per day (bpd) now, down from 2.6 million bpd before the war. The country is home to 115 billion barrels of proven reserves, the third largest in the world. </p>
<p>While Iraq&#8217;s oil sector was crippled by sanctions, Saddam Hussein also mismanaged the sector, overworking it and depriving it of needed maintenance. He did sign numerous oil deals with various countries, including China. The Wall Street Journal reports that Talabani will try to renew a $1.2 billion deal to explore an oilfield in Iraq&#8217;s southern Wasit province, first signed in 1997 with the China National Petroleum Corp. &#8220;I am looking forward to the visit and hope it will open a new phase of the bilateral relations between the two countries,&#8221; Talabani told the Xinhua news agency. Oil minister Hussain Al Shahristani said during an October 2006 visit to China that negotiations over the Ahdab oilfield were to begin. </p>
<p>A law governing Iraq&#8217;s oil, however, has been stuck for months in political wrangling over control of the oilfields. Any new contract depends on the oil law, which may not even be introduced to Iraq&#8217;s parliament until the end of July. Without the law to dictate investment guidelines, violence in the country has also deterred oil companies. But China, working in Nigeria&#8217;s militant-laden oil sector and genocidal Sudan, may be willing to take the risk to meet its growing demand for oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparative advantage might be decreasing for US firms.  If you were an Iraqi nationalist, would you hold up the oil law, and seek a freer market for your country?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/contributors/1315">George Lakoff</a> offers a frame to consider about Iraq and the ME.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenspan&#8217;s revelation and the contracts (PSA oil contracts) need to be discussed openly. The question must be asked, &#8220;Is our military there for the sake of oil?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been struck by the use of the word &#8220;victory&#8221; by the right wing, especially by its propaganda arm, Freedom&#8217;s Watch. Usually, &#8220;victory&#8221; is used in reference to a war between countries over territory, where there is a definable enemy. That is not the case in Iraq, where we have for four years had an occupation, not a &#8220;war,&#8221; and there has been no clear enemy. We have mostly been fighting Iraqis we were supposed to be rescuing. &#8220;Victory&#8221; makes no sense for such an occupation. And even Petraeus has said that only a political, not a military, settlement is possible. In what sense can keeping troops there for 9 or 10 years or longer, as Petraeus has suggested, be a &#8220;victory&#8221;?</p>
<p>What is most frightening is that they may mean what they say, that they may have a concept of &#8220;victory&#8221; that makes sense to them but not to the rest of the country. If the goal of the invasion and occupation of Iraq has been to guarantee access to Iraqi oil for the next 30 years, then any result guaranteeing oil profits for American oil companies would count as &#8220;victory.&#8221; Suppose the present killing and chaos were to continue, forcing us to keep our troops there indefinitely, but allowing the oil companies to prosper under our protection. That would be a &#8220;victory.&#8221; Or if the Iraqi army and police force were to develop in a few years and keep order there protecting American investments and workers, that too would be &#8220;victory.&#8221; If the country broke up into three distinct states or autonomous governments, that too would be &#8220;victory&#8221; as long as oil profits were guaranteed and Americans in the oil industry protected. And it doesn&#8217;t matter if a Republican president keeps the troops there or a Democratic president does. It is still an oil company &#8220;victory&#8221; &#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />Indeed, Kurdistan&#8217;s PSA contract last week with Hunt Oil suggests the latter form of &#8220;victory.&#8221; As Paul Krugman observed in the New York Times on September 14, &#8220;the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil, is a close political ally of Mr. Bush. More than that, Mr. Hunt is a member of the President&#8217;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a key oversight body.&#8221; Hunt Oil seems to have had the first taste of &#8220;victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that is &#8220;victory,&#8221; what is &#8220;defeat&#8221; and who is being &#8220;defeated?&#8221; The troops who would have to stay to protect the oil investments would, person by person, suffer defeat — a defeat of the spirit and, for too many, of the body. And most of America would suffer a defeat, especially our taxpayers who have paid a trillion dollars that could have gone for health care for all, for excellent schools and college educations, for rebuilding Louisiana and Mississippi, for shoring up our infrastructure and bridges, and for protecting our environment. Victory for the oil companies, defeat for most of America.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2005/crudedesigns.htm#summary">Global Policy Forum</a> offers an analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our key findings are:</p>
<p>At an oil price of $40 per barrel, Iraq stands to lose between $74 billion and $194 billion over the lifetime of the proposed contracts (2), from only the first 12 oilfields to be developed. These estimates, based on conservative assumptions, represent between two and seven times the current Iraqi government budget.</p>
<p>Under the likely terms of the contracts, oil company rates of return from investing in Iraq would range from 42% to 162%, far in excess of usual industry minimum target of around 12% return on investment. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hormats, in his visit here, said protection of energy sources was the big idea for defense as well as whatever he thought terrorists were, which he did not define.</p>
<p>If the premise is only &#8216;half right&#8217; for Iraq, if true believers thought so many ideas actually came together for the sake of democracy, vital US interests, and humanitarian concerns as the other half of the goalposts, does it still justify the profits from the PSA&#8217;s for the 80 working oilfields and already discovered oil, and does it not poison the professed concern?</p>
<p>&#8220;Victory&#8221; is certainly a flexible idea, but it feels to me we are paying twice, first to be hijacked, second to be rescued.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Greenspan corrected in a follow-up interview. [Bob Woodward in Monday&#8217;s Washington Post] He was only saying that &#8220;taking out Saddam was essential&#8221; for &#8220;oil security&#8221; and the global economy.</p>
<p>I fail to see the difference given the way the things are working. Opportunity costs.</p>

                                <p>A couple weeks ago, I tried to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">rank Presidents by growth rates</a>.  This week I try to produce a similar ranking by fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>I’m going to try to stick to the numbers as much as possible, but no doubt some people won’t like the numbers I pick.  Nevertheless, I think in principal we can all agree (until the numbers come in)… in a time of national debts, a President who shrinks government spending and manages to bring in more revenue is fiscally responsible.  One who bloats the government and brings in less revenue is fiscally responsible.  </p>
<p>We begin with size of government, just to get a feel for where an administration’s priorities sit.  One measure of government that the President has a fair amount of control over is the number of civilian federal employees per 100,000 people.  The data, which goes back only to 1962 (and thus doesn&#8217;t include Ike), is graphed at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">this post</a> and summarized in the table below…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaCuthUeI/AAAAAAAAAtA/ge7M6s06Cy4/s1600-h/federal+executive+employees+per+100K+people+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaCuthUeI/AAAAAAAAAtA/ge7M6s06Cy4/s320/federal+executive+employees+per+100K+people+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we see, Clinton posted the biggest drop, followed by Nixon/Ford, GHW, Carter and GW.  Only Reagan and JFK/LBJ posted increases.  In JFK/LBJ’s case, it was to fight a war.  In Reagan’s – I’m not entirely sure.  But he sure talked a good game about shrinking government, didn’t he?</p>
<p>But what about all expenditures?  Well, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">this post looked at</a> (among other things) Federal Outlays as a percentage of GDP.  Yes, Congress has a big say in this figure, but the President is the one who submits the budget to Congress, often has the support of a majority of the members of Congress, and wields a veto pen.  The table below summarizes outlays as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaPuthUfI/AAAAAAAAAtI/YMhppJim9T0/s1600-h/outlays+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaPuthUfI/AAAAAAAAAtI/YMhppJim9T0/s320/outlays+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As we see in the graph above, Clinton was, by a very large margin, the biggest cutter of spending.  And if you think that was a function of the dot com boom, or Newt Gingrich, wander over to the original post and look at the graph… outlays began dropping dramatically the year the man took office, so unless the tech boom started in 1993, or Newt had a time machine, the spending cuts in the Clinton era appear to be due to… Bill Clinton.  The next biggest spending cutter was Ike, although by the end of his term the trend had reversed itself.  Reagan managed to cut spending as a percentage of GDP too… by 0.23% a year.  The rest of the Presidents increased spending.  Nixon/Ford was the least spendthrift of these, followed by Carter, then GHW, then GW and JFK/LBJ.  Of course, GW still has time to build on his spending record.  </p>
<p>But spending isn’t a big deal if it leads to more growth, or its matched by revenues being generated.  This <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">post referenced above</a> also shows what receipts as a percentage of GDP look like.  The table below summarizes the changes seen during each administration:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcafuthUgI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/KaM7bscUxb0/s1600-h/receipts+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcafuthUgI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/KaM7bscUxb0/s320/receipts+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As the table indicates…  Clinton increased revenues as a percentage of GDP.  (Once again, I invite readers to check out the graphs in the aforementioned post…  this trend began immediately upon his taking office – in other words, its due to Clinton’s tax hikes and other policies, not the Republican Revolution or the tech boom or any other event that came later.)  Carter came in second.  JFK/LBJ came in third, but they saw a slight decrease in tax revenues.  They were followed by Nixon/Ford, Reagan, Ike, and GHW.  Bringing up the very, very distant rear was GW.  (Didn’t GW tell us recently how his tax cuts raised tax revenues?)  </p>
<p>Another way to look at tax revenues is through real revenues per capita…  a graph and a summary table are available <a her="“http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/comparing-presidents-real-tax-receipts.html”">here</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the overall measure of fiscal responsibility…  the surplus or deficit.  Together with the graphs of receipts and outlays, you can find a graph of the evolution of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">the surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP here</a>.  A summary table appears below:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcarethUhI/AAAAAAAAAtY/h0ng0THMEyY/s1600-h/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcarethUhI/AAAAAAAAAtY/h0ng0THMEyY/s320/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note – because the surplus jumps from positive to negative, an annualized growth could not be computed.  Instead, the graph shows the change in the surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP divided by the years in the term.)</p>
<p>And to make it easy, here’s a ranking:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvca2ethUiI/AAAAAAAAAtg/TXToXu9IEzM/s1600-h/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+rankings.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvca2ethUiI/AAAAAAAAAtg/TXToXu9IEzM/s320/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clinton is the clear winner – tops in increasing revenue and cutting spending, followed distantly by History’s Greatest Monster.  Ike came in third.  These were the only three fiscally responsible administrations… all others increased the deficit.  Reagan did so by the least, followed by Nixon/Ford.  JFK/LBJ were next, but GHW was virtually tied.  Bringing up the rear…  GW.  </p>
<p>Of course, running a deficit is OK if its going to lead to rapid growth.  But that doesn’t seem to be the case.  JFK/LBJ ran up a big deficit and also produced <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">commendable growth rates</a>.  However, Clinton, topped both sets of rankings, and Carter also did a good job by both measures.  Ike did well on fiscal responsibility, not so much on growth.  Reagan and Nixon came in the middle of the pack by both measures, and the Bush Presidents were Bush leaguers either way.  (Clearly data on economic growth and data on fiscal responsibility has Bush Derangement Syndrome!!!  Fortunately the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going swimmingly, Osama has been jailed, the dollar is strong and the poverty rate is dropping precipitously or GW’s approval rating would be about 30% and his legacy would be one of failure.)</p>

The summary is posted, but the links and data are worth the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush gave a false description of proposed legislation to expand the 10-year-old federal program to provide health insurance for children in low-income working families.</p>
<p>He said it &#8220;would result&#8221; in covering children in families with incomes up to $83,000 per year, which isn&#8217;t true. The Urban Institute estimated that 70 percent of children who would gain coverage are in families earning half that amount, and the bill contains no requirement for setting income eligibility caps any higher than what&#8217;s in the current law.</p>
<p>He also said the program was &#8220;meant to help poor children,&#8221; when in fact Congress stated that it was meant to expand insurance coverage beyond the poor and to cover millions of &#8220;low-income&#8221; children who were well above the poverty line. Under current law most states cover children at twice or even three times the official poverty level.</p>
<p>The president also says Congress&#8217; expansion is a step toward government-run health care for all. It&#8217;s true that some children and families with private insurance are expected to shift to the government program. But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that such a shift is relatively low considering the number of uninsured these bills would reach.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I haven&#8217;t had anything to say about the General Betrayus add by Move-On.  If anything, to me it seems tamer than half the stuff that comes out of Ann Coulter, or Dinesh D&#8217;Souza blaming liberals who refuse to live by the &#8220;moral&#8221; standards he shares with Bin Laden for 9/11, or Michael Ledeen telling US soldiers in Iraq to quit wasting their time swilling designer lattes and get a move on getting the job done in Iraq.  And these are all people considered patriots by many.  </p>
<p>That said, it seems to me that <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/09/bury-my-heart-at-wounded-feelings-since.html">TBogg has the right response to the whole issue</a>.</p>
