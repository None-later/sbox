                                <p>“Hillary Care” is a strange patchwork quilt, a plan surely designed by a committee, a political committee at that.</p>
<p>It is disappointing in its timidity but brash in its promises:</p>
<p><strong>Timid –<br /></strong><br />traditional private insurance is largely left alone, although re-regulated.</p>
<p><strong>Brash –</strong> how about this promise?</p>
<p>“Insurance and Drug Companies: insurance companies will end discrimination based on pre-existing conditions or expectations of illness and ensure <em><strong>high value for every premium dollar; while drug companies will offer fair prices and accurate information.”</strong> (emphasis mine)</em></p>
<p>How any politician could promise such results, without hyper regulating these sectors, or nationalizing both, is way beyond me. If so, why not just a national plan?</p>
<p>The plan [http://www.hillaryclinton.com/feature/healthcareplan/summary.aspx ] is just all over the place, trying to please everyone it seems.</p>
<p>Hillary promises more efficient use of private insurance dollars, and I don’t know how she does that short of nationalizing the health insurance industry – and come to think of it, a lot of people wanted her to do just that.</p>
<p>This plan is just weird, a something-for-everyone buffet line of promises.</p>
<p>Deja veux all over again.</p>

                                <p>The city where I lived most of my adult life recently suffered a devastating flood, after a series of smaller floods earlier this year (global warming anyone?).</p>
<p>The flood exceeded the 100 year flood plain and flooded places that have not been flooded in recorded history. The city needs a great deal of help.</p>
<p>Every once in a while Senator George Voinovich has an outburst of un-politician like honesty.</p>
<p>Yesterday George was touring and meeting city officials and he let loose with this:</p>
<p>Excerpted from the Toledo  Blade……..</p>
<p>Voinovich: War taking up funds Findlay need</p>
<p>FINDLAY &#8211; Federal help to prevent future flooding in Findlay and Ottawa is limited because the United States is waging a costly war in Iraq, U.S. Sen. George Voinovich said yesterday.</p>
<p>Even if the United States stopped fighting in Iraq today, the bill likely would reach $1 trillion. However, President Bush has trimmed infrastructure-related budgets &#8211; those that deal with items such as rivers, highways, and bridges &#8211; because they are too costly, the Ohio Republican said during a visit to Findlay.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just aren&#8217;t in the real world and until people wake up to that fact, we&#8217;re not going to be able to take care of problems like yours,&#8221; he told Findlay Mayor Tony Iriti and Ottawa Mayor Ken Maag. The senator added: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do what I can to be of help to you.&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Senator Voinovich visited with federal, state, and local officials to get a report on how agencies worked together during the last month&#8217;s disaster.</p>

<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/09/john-cassidy-ma.html">Brad DeLong</a> has a problem with the following from <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/2007/09/12/Alan-Greenspan-Age-of-Turbulence">John Cassidy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the middle of 2002, however, it was clear that for whatever reason &#8211; low interest rates, the Bush tax cuts, increased military spending &#8211; the economy was staging an amazingly robust recovery. At that point, history and economic orthodoxy suggested that the Fed should have been tightening policy rather than loosening it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad provides a compelling case for his claim that Cassidy is all wet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, it was not clear at all by the middle of 2002 that the economy was staging an &#8220;amazingly robust recovery.&#8221; The recovery did not become anything anybody could call &#8220;robust&#8221; in any sense until 2004. Want evidence that it was not clear in mid-2002 that the recovery was &#8220;robust&#8221;?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here in the latter part of 2007, we can look back on the period from 2001 to today in terms of the employment to population ratio as well as real GDP growth rates by quarter.  Real GDP growth (annualized) was only 2.5% for the first three quarters of 2002, which was followed by almost no growth during the last quarter of 2002 and very little growth for the first quarter of 2003.  The employment to population ratio, which had dropped from 64.4% as of January 2001 to 62.7% as of April 2002, seemed to have stabilized at that level through September 2002, but then it started its second downward march bottoming out at 62.0% in September 2003. </p>
<p>I had always thought that the recovery did not get going until after we geared up for that disaster known as the Iraq War.  Mr. Cassidy chastised Alan Greenspan for not understanding that “the economy was staging an amazingly robust recovery”.  But the data shows that there was not a robust recovery until a full year later.  So we should thank the Federal Reserve for not raising interest rates sooner.  As far as Mr. Cassidy, what can you say about a person too stupid to look at the simple facts displayed by our graphs?</p>

<blockquote><p>A new study argues that simple economic forces arising from segregation directly create economic inequity, independent of any psychological effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>The study shows that even when there is no history of discrimination between two groups, social segregation alone can cause dramatic economic inequities to develop.</p>
<p>Rajiv Sethi of Columbia University, Glenn Loury of Brown University in Providence, R.I., and Sam Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, have created a simple mathematical model for understanding the interaction between segregation and inequality. They imagined a situation in which discrimination that had historically existed between two groups of people came to an end, so that people from both groups who had equal skills subsequently began earning equal wages. The researchers then asked whether, over many generations, the income of the two groups would tend to equalize or whether the disparity would persist.</p>
<p>The model incorporated the idea that parents tend to invest more heavily in giving their children the skills that employers value when they expect that investment to pay off later in higher wages. It also included the fact that children are more likely to succeed when they are surrounded by other children who are succeeding. For example, studies show that having friends with strong vocabularies helps a child to pick up more words with less effort.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you have enough integration between the social networks of the two groups, the inequality will go away over generations,&#8221; Sethi says, but otherwise, the inequality could get worse, the study shows. &#8220;Equal opportunity won&#8217;t be enough,&#8221; notes Sethi. He presented the team&#8217;s results July 7 at PET07, the conference of the Association for Public Economic Theory, in Nashville.</p>
<p>The researchers also performed their mathematical experiment with two segregated groups that began with equal skills and income. The team found that even when the two groups start out equal, some slight discrepancy is bound to develop randomly over time. As soon as that happens, the same dynamics come into play and magnify the inequality, making one group wealthier and more highly skilled and the other group poorer and less skilled.</p></blockquote>

</p>
<p>Productivity growth is clearly slowing, and the key question is, is this a purely cyclical development or is it signaling a slowing in the long term trend growth rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru58LMHuONI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_ESHDsDyITA/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru58LMHuONI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_ESHDsDyITA/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Slowing productivity is a normal cyclical development and it is such a strong pattern, that historically, it has been a very good leading indicator.  But this implies that we can not really determine if the recent slowing is just cyclical weakness or a trend shift.</p>
</p>
<p>To answer this question we need to look at indicators that either lead or determine productivity growth.  It is a question economists have been researching for years </p>
<p>But clearly a major factor in productivity growth is the real capital stock per worker and it is generally widely accepted that this accounts for a quarter to half of productivity growth.  Moreover, it also leads productivity growth by about a year.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru6D48HuOQI/AAAAAAAAAA0/BQL83XvxFWI/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru6D48HuOQI/AAAAAAAAAA0/BQL83XvxFWI/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is also a long term relationship between trend productivity growth and trend growth in the real capital stock per workers as the following chart demonstrates.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Ru6D48HuOQI/AAAAAAAAAA0/BQL83XvxFWI/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><br /></a></p>

<p>From WW II until the late 1970s, early 1980s there was a very strong and relatively stable trend growth rate for both productivity and real capital stock per employee.  But in the 1980s economic cycle growth in the real capital stock per employee stagnated, as it was still the same in 1990 as it had been in 1982.  There was a cyclical bump in the early 1990s but this was driven more by a drop in employment then by stronger investment.  With the capital spending boom of the late 1990s growth in productivity and the capital stock per employee surged again. But in recent years growth has stagnated again as since the Bush tax cut it has failed to grow.</p>
</p>
<p>This data on growth in the real capital stock per employee strongly implies that the recent slowing in productivity growth is not just a cyclical slowdown.  Rather it looks like a shift to a slower growth trend driven by weak capital spending.</p>
<p>Obviously, given the limitations of blogging I can not get into much of a discussion of why growth in the real capital stock per employee did not grow in the 1980s or in recent years.  However, these results are exactly the opposite of what the advocates of supply-side economics or republican trickle-down policies have promised.  Maybe the simple answer is that there is no significant relationship between tax policy and capital spending.</p>
<p>  But on the other hand since WW II the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> has experienced good growth in the capital stock per employee except in the years when supply side economic policies were in place.   I’ll leave it to the advocates of such policy to explain these discrepancies. However, I believe this is the fundamental or core reason why Cactus keeps finding that the economy does better under democrats than under republicans</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.gallupworldpoll.com/content/?ci=28678">This analysis of Gallup Poll</a> data offers insights for us to seriously think about. It also fits in with <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/">John Robb&#8217;s expert theory</a> on terrorisms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Often U.S. policy-makers and other intellectuals draw an analogy between the Cold War and the current &#8220;global war on terror&#8221; and recommend analogous strategies, because, after all, both conflicts battled over people&#8217;s hearts and minds. But results from Gallup&#8217;s surveys in the Muslim world point to important differences between the two conflicts and real risks in confusing them by applying similar strategies.<br />At the heart of the Cold War analogy is the belief that religious fanaticism fuels extremism and therefore replacing Muslims&#8217; worldview with Western liberalism is the path to victory against terrorism. To begin to understand the danger of this diagnosis, we must first understand the factors that do and do not drive sympathy for violence.<br />As a starting point, Muslims do not hold a monopoly on extremist views. While 6% of Americans think attacks in which civilians are targets are &#8220;completely justified,&#8221; in both Lebanon and Iran, this figure is 2%, and in Saudi Arabia, it&#8217;s 4%. In Europe, Muslims in Paris and London were no more likely than were their counterparts in the general public to believe attacks on civilians are ever justified and at least as likely to reject violence, even for a &#8220;noble cause.&#8221;<br />After analyzing survey data representing more than 90% of the global Muslim population, Gallup found that despite widespread anti-American sentiment, only a small minority saw the 9/11 attacks as morally justified. Even more significant, there was no correlation between level of religiosity and extremism among respondents. Among the 7% of the population that fits in the politically radicalized category &#8212; those who saw the 9/11 attacks as completely justifiable and have an unfavorable view of the United States &#8212; 94% said religion is an important part of their daily lives, compared with 90% among those in the moderate majority. And no significant difference exists between radicals and moderates in mosque attendance.<br />Gallup probed respondents further and actually asked both those who condoned and condemned extremist acts why they said what they did. The responses fly in the face of conventional wisdom. For example, in Indonesia, the largest Muslim majority country in the world, many of those who condemned terrorism cited humanitarian or religious justifications to support their response. For example, one woman said, &#8220;Killing one life is as sinful as killing the whole world,&#8221; paraphrasing verse 5:32 in the Quran.<br />On the other hand, not a single respondent in Indonesia who condoned the attacks of 9/11 cited the Quran for justification. Instead, this group&#8217;s responses were markedly secular and worldly. For example, one Indonesian respondent said, &#8220;The U.S. government is too controlling toward other countries, seems like colonizing.&#8221;<br />The real difference between those who condone terrorist acts and all others is about politics, not piety. For example, the politically radicalized often cite &#8220;occupation and U.S. domination&#8221; as their greatest fear for their country and only a small minority of them agree the United States would allow people in the region to fashion their own political future or that it is serious about supporting democracy in the region. Also, among this group&#8217;s top responses was the view that to better relations with the Muslim world, the West should respect Islam and stop imposing its beliefs and policies. In contrast, moderates most often mentioned economic problems as their greatest fear for their country, and along with respecting Islam, they see economic support and investments as a way for the West to better relations. Moderates are also more likely than the politically radicalized to say the United States is serious about promoting democracy.<br />While the politically radicalized are as likely as the moderate majority to say better relations with the West is of personal concern to them, they are much less likely to believe the West reciprocates this concern and therefore much less likely to believe improved relations will ever come. In short, perceptions of being under siege characterize those who sympathize with extremism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several thoughts occur to me. I am also not an expert on these matters so I must rely on readings to try to figure out what is going on and what policy I can reasonably support.</p>
<p>1. I am averse to &#8216;global truths&#8217; because I have never found them adequate to explain human behaviors or produce accurate planning information.<br />2. History often shows the deficiency of such approaches after the fact, which I will not explore on this post. Such perceptions are used to confirm a priori beliefs instead of leading to questions to be solved. Perhaps this is a matter of temperament for some, or calculation for others.<br />3. In a speech, asking questions of nuance is very hum drum and has no punch or ring to it. Advertising needs catchy stimuli to work, so works on our limbic system the most dramatically. As a way to develop policy&#8230;not so good.</p>

<blockquote><p>Iraqi lawmakers said on Saturday that Washington should take responsibility for the turmoil in Iraq and stop blaming Baghdad, Iran and Syria.</p>
<p>Frustrated by criticism from the United States over their slow progress towards political goals meant to foster national reconciliation, Iraqi leaders said Washington would be better served by examining its own progress in the unpopular war.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans always try to pretend the responsibility for cleaning up this mess isn&#8217;t theirs and tend to shift blame onto Iraq, Iran and Syria for everything that goes wrong,&#8221; said veteran Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they should stop this nonsense and admit that most of the accountability rests on their shoulders,&#8221; he told Reuters.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Last week, the British government agreed to introduce a new law titled the &#8220;Corporate Manslaughter Statute.&#8221; This law is remarkable because it attempts to make companies&#8211;not persons&#8211;criminally responsible for deaths caused by a firm&#8217;s gross negligence. In this column, I will examine the law&#8217;s structure, its history, and finally, I will ask how American law approaches the same problems the Corporate Manslaughter Act is designed to solve.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corporate Manslaughter Act<br /></strong>The British law allows the state to prosecute a corporation or partnership (an &#8220;organization&#8221; for short) for the crime of manslaughter if the organization causes the death of a person as the result of its &#8220;gross&#8221; breach of a duty owed under the law of negligence. However, in order for the state to prove its case, it must prove that a substantial element of the gross breach of duty resulted from the way in which the organization&#8217;s activities were &#8220;managed or organised by its senior management.&#8221;</p>
<p>The penalties for violating the act are quite interesting. First, a court can impose unlimited financial penalties on the organization, once it is convicted. Second, a court may issue a &#8220;publicity order,&#8221; which requires the organization to publicly announce (through advertisements, it seems) that it has been successfully prosecuted for corporate manslaughter and is subject to any other penalties the court may have ordered. </p>
</p>
<p>The third and final potential penalty is that the court can order the organization to publicly take remedial steps to correct the conditions that led to the breach of duty. This penalty could have potentially far-reaching consequences, depending on how the courts choose to interpret it. For example, under this remedy, suppose a court decides that a design defect was the result of conscious indifference to the safety of others (such as in the famous Ford Pinto case). The court could simply order a manufacturer to change the design of their product&#8211;a power that no American court currently possesses. </p>
<p><strong>The Impetus for the British Law: Spectacular and Disturbing Accidents</strong><br />The most direct explanation for the advent of the British law is that there have been a number of spectacular industrial and transportation accidents in the United Kingdom since the Thatcher era of privatization. This is especially true in the area of rail traffic, where the public has become increasingly uneasy about the degree to which the private train operators who took over public lines have placed profit about the public good. </p>
</p>
<p>The Southall rail crash of 1997, in which 10 people died in a high-speed train in London, illustrated for many the weakness of the old laws. The company that operated the train, GWT, was prosecuted for common-law manslaughter, but the case failed, despite the voluminous evidence that there was a systematic failure of safety management. Similar disasters involving ferry wrecks and gas works explosions helped reinforce the impression that corporations were not answerable in court because senior management always pointed the finger at someone else.</p>
<p><strong>British versus American Law on Corporate Responsibility</strong><br />In the United States, as in England, it is very difficult to hold either organizations or their officers responsible for gross negligence. For example, while many law students learn about the success civil tort plaintiffs had in suing Ford for failing to spend $13 per car to strengthen a gas tank known to be vulnerable to rear- end collisions, few learn that, at the same time, a prosecutor brought a case in criminal negligence against Ford in Indiana—and lost the jury trial.<br />&#8230;<br />In conclusion, the new Corporate Manslaughter Act is a fascinating experiment. Americans who are interested in deterring organizational wrongdoing should watch carefully to see how British judges apply the law, which prosecutions are and are not brought, and whether the law has a measurable, positive impact on either accident costs or liability costs. If the U.S. Supreme Court continues to cut back on the availability of punitive damages under state and federal law, perhaps the gap in deterrence&#8211;if there is one&#8211;created by the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decisions could, in the future, be filled by something like the Corporate Manslaughter Act. </p></blockquote>
<p>America relies on private litigation to obtain redress of harm, but this method does not regard the company as a person in the way other parts of US law allow. The British proposal allows for this viewpoint of the fiction of &#8216;person&#8217; but does not have the private citizen mechanism for &#8216;punitive damages&#8217; that US law allows. What do we wish for?<br />(BTW, I made up the title, just like The McGyver heist between Switzerland and China)</p>

<blockquote><p>[S]ince money&#8217;s worth is only as a means to exchange goods and services, then it functions as a way to determine the worth of something. When an economy is beset by inflation or deflation, then the economy&#8217;s ability to determine the worth of goods and services is compromised.</p>
<p>My argument is that, by ensuring that the value of money remains neutral &#8211; neither inflating in price nor deflating in price &#8211; then the economy is best able to use money to its full advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having lived in South America in the 70s and 80s, I know first-hand that hyperinflation makes planning difficult and is bad for the economy.  But what about small amounts of inflation or deflation?  Are we truly better off with zero real growth in the money supply?  Might not some small amount of money illusion produce a motivating factor (and if so, how much is too much)?  Is there some other reason why this might not be true?</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know the answer to these questions.  Have at it.</p>
