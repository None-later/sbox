                                <p>Someone tell <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/is-rudy-out-of-.html">Mark Thoma</a> that he is having too much fun and that we all know <a href="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/issues">RUDY</a> is an idiot.  But <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/09/how-big-is-supp.html">Tyler Cowen</a> is very smart:</p>
<blockquote><p>Might Reagan&#8217;s huge tax increase have had something to do with that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tyler is reminding the doofs that wrote <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Laffer_curve">this</a> that the “near doubling of federal tax reciepts ($500 billion to $900 billion” was in part due to the increase in payroll taxes and in part due to rising prices.  Incidentally, the doofs can’t even spell receipts.  But this gets much worse when one turns to their <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-261.html">source</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nominal federal revenues doubled in the 1980s from $517 billion to $1.031 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The doofs were off by over $100 billion as to the level of total Federal revenues at the end of this period.  Can’t spell, can’t read.  But let’s not let William A. Niskanen and Stephen Moore off the hook either:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent during the Reagan years versus 2.8 percent during the Ford-Carter years and 2.1 percent during the Bush-Clinton years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind you that they wrote this in late 1996 and they likely did not see the Clinton boom taking off.  After all – that 1993 tax increase was supposed to lead to economic ruin according to this crowd.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While I realize that <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/inside_media_baseball_wednesda.php">this review</a> of John Chait’s take down <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070910&#038;s=chait091007&#038;c=3">Crakcpot Economics</a> will drive those of on the left crazy, I really like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chait tars all tax-cutters with the ideas of the looniest supply siders. One can believe that tax cuts, by reducing deadweight loss and/or providing fiscal stimulus, will be good for the economy, without necessarily believing that the economy will be crippled by a 5% rate increase. His primary exhibits for the nefarious influence of supply-side policy are: Larry Lindsay, Dick Cheney, Jack Kemp, Jude Wanniski, and George Gilder. Cheney I give you, but Larry Lindsay was drummed out of the administration in disgrace (for unrelated reasons) even before Bush&#8217;s major tax cut, and Chait somehow neglects to mention the more conventional economists who have occupied the job since. Jack Kemp hasn&#8217;t had access to serious power since I was snoring my way through Algebra I, and what power he did have was over HUD. Moreover, though I agree that Jude Wanniski and George Gilder are barking moonbats, they have, to put it kindly, limited influence on today&#8217;s Republican party; which is hardly surprising given that Wanniski was kicked out of the party in disgrace before he died in 2005, and George Gilder has turned his attentions to that hugely influention Republican mouthpiece, the Gilder Technology report. This motley collection of names is hardly proof that the Supply Siders Have Taken Over the Building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet!  But wait a second – George Bush once dubbed Lawrence Lindsey the smartest economist he ever met (what an insult to Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw).  I could go on but <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/the_relevance_of_supplysiders.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> has done the hard work for me.  So let me just focus on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>And, of course, in addition to this insignificant crew of presidents and congressional leaders, there&#8217;s  people like Rudy Guiliani and John McCain As Greg Mankiw put it &#8220;fealty to the most extreme supply-side views is de rigeur in some segments of the Republican party.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that Greg Mankiw has called out Guiliani and McCain on their free lunch BS, Mitt Romney is spreading the same BS.  Didn’t Greg say he was one of Romney’s economic advisors?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In his discussion, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/out-of-the-main.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to another version of an oft heard <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20070906/COMMENTARY/109060023/1012">silly claim</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Even Democrats can&#8217;t reasonably deny we&#8217;ve experienced sustained economic growth following the Bush tax cuts. Instead, they&#8217;ve resurrected the canard they used to discredit the phenomenal growth of the supply-side Reagan years … Contrary to liberal propaganda, the Reagan tax cuts led to dramatic increases in federal revenues even after adjusting for inflation. Increases in the deficit were due to the spending side, some of the blame for which admittedly should be shared by Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is David Limbaugh really this stupid or does he just assume his readers won’t fact check his mendacity.  Yes, we have had an anemic recovery from the 2001 recession but the average annual growth rate since George Bush has taken office has been only 2.4 percent.  The average annual growth rate from 1980 to 1992 was only 3 percent – as compared to growth rates near 3.5 percent for the 1950’s, 1960, 1970’s, and the Clinton years. </p>
<p>But at least David knows how to adjust for inflation – unlike that WSJ op-ed piece by Art Laffer and Jack Kemp just before the 2000 election.  As Laffer and Kemp advocated free lunch supply-sider George W. Bush should get our vote, they flat out lied to us by a host of confusions – including the nominal v. real canard – as they tried to claim the 1981 tax cut doubled revenues.  But let’s take a closer look at Federal revenues in 1992 versus 1980 (two periods at similar points in the business cycle) by separating payroll taxes from current receipts (the latter being income and profit taxes).  Payroll taxes were $162.6 billion in 1980 and were $441.8 billion in 1992.  This 172% nominal increase represented a 70% real increase and the price-level rose by about 60% over the 12-year period.  Current receipts rose from $335.9 billion in 1980 to $660.4 billion in 1992 or by about 86% in nominal terms.  But in real terms, we are talking about an increase of only 16% over a 12-year period. Considering the fact that the US population rose by 13% over this same period – real per capita Federal current receipts grew by less than 3% over a 12-year period.  Not exactly a dramatic increase after all – is it?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, none of this reality should be new to anyone.  Either David Limbaugh is an incredibly clueless person or he is a very dishonest person.  But hey – the GOP label should be Moonbats R Us!</p>

<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s army, despite measurable progress, will be unable to take over internal security from U.S. forces in the next 12 to 18 months and &#8220;cannot yet meaningfully contribute to denying terrorists safe haven,&#8221; according to a report on the Iraqi security forces published today.</p>
<p>The report, prepared by a commission of retired senior U.S. military officers, describes the 25,000-member Iraqi national police force and the Interior Ministry, which controls it, as riddled with sectarianism and corruption. The ministry, it says, is &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221; and is &#8220;a ministry in name only.&#8221; The commission recommended that the national police force be disbanded.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The assessment by the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq is one of several independent progress reports ordered by Congress for delivery before the administration presents its own scorecard next week. Members of the 20-member group, headed by retired Marine Gen. James Jones, traveled throughout Iraq over the summer and met with hundreds of U.S. and Iraqi officials as well as leading nongovernmental experts on the Iraqi forces. Jones will present the 152-page document, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, in testimony today before the Senate and House Armed Services committees.</p>
<p>As he ended a year in charge of training the Iraqi security forces in 2005, then-Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus said that Iraq&#8217;s military had made &#8220;enormous progress&#8221; and that its readiness to take over from U.S. forces was growing &#8220;with each passing week.&#8221; President Bush said of the Iraqi forces, &#8220;As they stand up, we&#8217;ll stand down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report expresses concern about what it calls the massive U.S. military logistical &#8220;footprint&#8221; in Iraq and its effect on perceptions and problems. &#8220;The unintended message conveyed is one of &#8216;permanence,&#8217; an occupying force, as it were,&#8221; the report says. It recommends reconsideration of &#8220;efficiency, necessity . . . and cost&#8221; and calls for &#8220;significant reductions, consolidations and realignments&#8221; of U.S. forces.</p>
<p>All of Iraq&#8217;s 18 provinces should be transferred to government control, the report says &#8212; only seven currently have that status &#8212; and a formal status-of-forces agreement should be pursued with the Iraqi government. &#8220;We believe that all [U.S.] bases in Iraq should demonstrate evidence of Iraqi sovereignty,&#8221; including flying the Iraqi flag, the report says. &#8220;There is a fine line,&#8221; it says, &#8220;between assistance and dependence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>From a column in <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/070831.html">the Straight Dope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the late 90s Swiss scientists found cholesterol drugs in their groundwater; when they started checking lakes and streams, they found the stuff almost everywhere. The United States Geological Survey measured levels of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other pollutants in 139 streams across the U.S. in 1999 and 2000 — 80 percent of the time they found at least one of the 95 chemicals they were screening for. The medical compounds seen most regularly were steroids and nonprescription drugs, though sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone turned up too; in a subsequent USGS study, hormones and steroids were detected in more than 40 percent of groundwater samples. German scientists have found antibiotics, beta blockers, and even antiepilepsy medicine in their water; in Canada researchers have found cancer drugs and anti-inflammatories; in the UK they’ve found everything from ibuprofen to antibiotics in streams and sewage alike.</p>
<p>The good news is that we&#8217;re talking about some very, very small quantities of drugs here — the levels found so far have typically been measured in parts per billion or even trillion. And after three decades of study, no one&#8217;s yet produced any evidence that drug residue puts humans at risk.  The less-good news runs a little longer. First, there may be long-term cumulative effects we haven’t identified yet, especially considering how persistent some residues are — clofibric acid, one by-product of a cholesterol drug, can hang around for two-plus decades. Second, the extremely low concentrations of residue in water make it hard to distinguish any such effects from ones caused by the zillion other chemicals we’re constantly exposed to. Then there’s the ongoing boom in prescription drug use: a 2004 report points out that while the U.S. population grew 13 percent between 1993 and 2003, the amount of prescription drugs we bought went up 70 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>Another possible concern is that we don’t know how all these drugs may interact. Some studies have found that combining different sex hormones in doses so tiny as to be theoretically insignificant can have a measurable (if small) effect. According to one USGS fish pathologist, something like this may be going on with pollutants in tributaries of the Potomac River, where in testing last year more than 80 percent of male largemouth and smallmouth bass were found to be producing eggs, which isn’t normally part of their repertoire.  Residue can also accumulate in the tissue of fish and other wildlife and get back to us via the food chain. Meanwhile, there’s always the potential problem of unmetabolized antibiotics entering the environment and helping breed a new generation of super-resistant bacteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week I had my yearly check-up.  The doctor asked me if I&#8217;m any medication.  Apparently when I told him &#8220;no&#8221;, I was wrong.  And I can&#8217;t help thinking, this might be one heck of a negative externality.</p>

                                <p>Reader CoRev sends me this e-mail..</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/">the Captains Quarters</a>:  Chuck Schumer a democratic leader made this statement: <br />
<blockquote>And let me be clear, the violence in Anbar has gone down despite the surge, not because of the surge. The inability of American  soldiers to protect these tribes from al Qaeda said to these tribes we  have to fight al Qaeda ourselves. It wasn&#8217;t that the surge brought peace  here. It was that the warlords took peace here, created a temporary  peace here. And that is because there was no one else there protecting.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is your belief, then there is no hope.  Your party will lose the next election with these beliefs. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly a partisan Democrat.  As I&#8217;ve stated many times, I consider the Dems to be less obnoxious than the Reps on the economy.  It does seem to me they&#8217;re a heck of a lot less obnoxious, though, when it comes to the war.</p>
<p>But for grins, I went to google to see about what CoRev wrote.  And in 5 seconds, I found <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0206/p01s01-woiq.html">an article</a> in the Christian Science Monitor entitled &#8220;Sunni Tribes Turn Against Jihadis&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s also turned away from supporting Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi and other foreign fighters in Iraq. &#8220;We realized that these foreign terrorists were hiding behind the veil of the noble Iraqi resistance,&#8221; says Mr. Jadaan. &#8220;They claim to be striking at the US occupation, but the reality is they are killing innocent Iraqis in the markets, in mosques, in churches, and in our schools.&#8221; </p>
<p>In Anbar Province, an insurgent hotbed that borders Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, US and Iraqi officials say they have a new ally against the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists: local tribal leaders like Jadaan and home-grown Iraqi insurgents. </p>
<p>&#8220;The local insurgents have become part of the solution and not part of the problem,&#8221; US Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch told reporters at a press conference last week.</p>
<p>Until recently, many of the Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar and local insurgent leaders collaborated with Islamic extremist groups whose funding and manpower is thought to come largely from abroad. They had a common goal: drive out the Americans.</p>
<p>But Mr. Zarqawi&#8217;s indiscriminate killing of innocent Iraqis has alienated many of his erstwhile Iraqi allies. His shadowy militant group, known as Al Qaeda in Iraq, is believed to have assassinated four prominent Anbar sheikhs. And in January when hundreds of Anbar men turned up at an Iraqi Army recruiting depot in Ramadi, the provincial capital, a suicide bomber killed 70 would-be soldiers.</p>
<p>Zarqawi&#8217;s brutal methods have stirred controversy beyond Iraq, as well. When he declared an &#8220;all out war&#8221; on Shiites last September, his former mentor, Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi, publicly rebuked him and Al Qaeda&#8217;s No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, warned him against alienating the Muslim masses.</p>
<p>But Zarqawi appears to have done just that. Last month, a poll of 1,150 Iraqis throughout the country, conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes, the website World Public Opinion, and the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, revealed that just 7 percent of Iraqis approve of attacks on Iraqi government security forces.The same poll, which over sampled Sunni Arabs, found that only 1 percent of Iraqis support attacks on Iraqi civilians.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We are caught in the middle between the terrorists coming to destroy us with their suicide belts, their TNT, and their car bombs, and the American Army that destroys our homes, takes our weapons, and doesn&#8217;t allow us to defend ourselves against the terrorists,&#8221; says Jadaan.</p>
<p>It was that frustration that first pushed Anbar&#8217;s elders to take a stand against outside terror groups, which set up camp there and turned Anbar&#8217;s highways into rat lines for foreign fighters coming in from Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>US and Iraqi forces launched a series of offensives throughout the province last year. Caught in the crossfire, Anbar&#8217;s residents began looking for a way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sheikh from the Samarra tribe, which had suffered a lot from the military operations, came to see the minister of defense, and he said, &#8216;Give me two weeks to get rid of the foreigners from our city,&#8217; &#8221; recalls Mohammed al-Askaree, an adviser to Iraq&#8217;s Sunni Arab Defense Minister Saadoun Dulaymi. &#8220;The minister said, &#8216;Take a month. If you get rid of the foreigners and the terrorists your city will avoid further problems.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>Other tribal sheikhs followed suit. About three months ago, Mr. Dulaymi, intent on exploiting the rift between the tribes and the foreign insurgents, convened a series of meetings with Anbar&#8217;s tribal sheikhs, religious leaders, and local elders. The US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, attended some of the meetings.</p>
<p>The provincial leaders made a number of demands in return for their cooperation, Mr. Askaree says. They asked for weapons to fight the terrorists with, but the minister refused. Instead the minister agreed to step up recruitment of Anbar residents to the Iraqi security forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to participate in attacking the terrorists, you have no choice but to send your sons to volunteer for the Army and give the Army information on the terrorists,&#8221; Askaree says the minister of defense told the gathered Anbar notables.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what Schumer said about the involvement of the US&#8230; seems to be correct.  Oh, and this article backs up one other thing Schumer said&#8230; about the timing, and how this is not related to the surge.  See, the article is dated February 06, 2006.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A lie is an assertion, believed to be false, made with the intention to deceive.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s essentially Bernard William&#8217;s definition of a lie on p. 96 of &#8220;Truth and Truthfulness.&#8221; It probably fits with how most of us think about a lie. But what about statements that use true facts to deceive?</p>
<p>August 31, <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2007/08/arguments-over-night-of-living-dead-in.html"> Juan Cole</a> was shrill about administration and media statements that GI deaths in Iraq were down for the year. His point was that temperatures get to 120 degrees, so summer means low combat. He produced a table contrasting 2006 with 2007 by month: deaths are higher in 2007 than 2006. He asked for a visual display and many responded. I&#8217;m posting mine here.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/Rt9eqfrfxHI/AAAAAAAAAB0/0BFCyRTAQ2A/s1600-h/GI_IraqDeaths.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cGHx7cVjYo0/Rt9eqfrfxHI/AAAAAAAAAB0/0BFCyRTAQ2A/s400/GI_IraqDeaths.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />But this is just part of a pattern of communicating, where true facts are presented within a limited context, so that the resulting asymmetry of information creates a false impression. Most of us don&#8217;t know that Iraq temperatures reach 120 degrees in July so that physical activity like combat is down. On the other hand, if an official announced that lowland US snow fall in July was the lowest it&#8217;s been all year &#8212; duh. The difference is that here in the US we all know about July snow fall, so there&#8217;s no asymmetry.</p>
<p>Since there’s <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/011985.php"> some dispute</a> about the August combat casualties, for the following I will shift back to July. That doesn’t change the substance of the argument.</p>
<p>What do you think? The three-star general who <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3437698"> reported</a> July deaths are down for the year &#8212; did he know that was because it was July, like we know about snow fall? Of course he did. The military needs to forecast its supply requirements. His staff forecasters incorporated the cycle, July is a low activity month. Surely that information reached the general. That&#8217;s like the Administration’s PhD economists had to know job creation was better in the US than in the EU and Japan because our population was growing at four times the rate as theirs. Nevertheless, they <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/eddie_lazear_sh.html"> write</a>, We’ve added more jobs “than all the jobs added in the European Union and Japan combined,” which suggested to most, because of asymmetric information, that the comparatively better job growth was the result of policy rather than the reality that it was because of an intrinsic phenomenon. There are many such examples.</p>
<p>So maybe, technically, these are not lies, because they assert true facts. But that doesn&#8217;t make them true statements. Paraphrasing <a href="http://stevenson.classicauthors.net/TruthOfIntercourse/"> Robert Lewis Stevenson</a>, a true statement does not just present true facts; a true statement is one that conveys a true impression. “July GI fatalities are the lowest for the year” is a true fact. On the other hand, “GI fatalities are higher every month so far this year compared with last”, is also a true fact. It&#8217;s the latter, however, not the former, that conveys a true impression.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has stated she would cut spending for contractor support for DoD by 50%. I tried to find her exact statement and instead found some testimony concerning waste and abuse in Army contracts in Iraq.</p>
<p>She seems to have figured it out from the <a href="http://www.justhillary.com/herwords/pentagon0419.php">following exchange</a> that took place on 19 Apr 2007; Senator Clinton to Assistant Sec Army Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, Claude Bolton (Pentagon insider, retired AF general, who &#8220;survived the C-17 scandals of 1989):</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<blockquote>Clinton: Here are a few excerpts from some of the DoD documents from July 2005: </p>
<p>There were concerns as to &#8220;the contractors&#8217; reluctance to down-size the labor force after the transfer or support missions to the sustainment contractor.&#8221; Also, July 2005, &#8220;The use of self-directed work added additional cost to the task order with no visible benefit to the government. &#8221; March 2006, &#8220;There was no effort to coordinate with the contracting officer to de-scope changes based on the reduction requirements and to establish a new definite price.&#8221; April 2006, &#8220;Command personnel advised us that the contractor wouldn&#8217;t move idle personnel or equipment assigned from one task order to another task order to accomplish needed work. When we brought this situation to the attention of top contractor operational personnel, they informed us this was a company policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senator Clinton asks some questions excerpts from Mr Bolton&#8217;s answers:</p>
<p>Bolton: One (Army chartered committee) is to look at requirements. These are requirements that come on a regular basis from the commanders to make sure that the commander is getting what he or she really wants. Sometimes those requirements are inflated. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ilsm here: Interesting that commanders make requirements for idle labor, the congress has required service contracts be performance based, that is let the private sector determine the cost effective approach, not create a featherbedding scam in the area of responsibility. </p>
<p>Back to the document&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bolton: And many times those bids are a lot larger and higher than we&#8217;d like them to be, so we put people in place to correct some of the things that you&#8217;ve just mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ilsm again: Here is where Bunny Greenhouse tried to stop one example of many, the 5 year no competition contract to Kellogg Brown Root (Halliburton). The performance was so necessary, they had no idea what was needed, but that they had to rush into 5 years of this kind of waste and abuse. Competition is the only way for the offerors to provide lean offers, removing competition left the Army and taxpayer holding the bag with no performance and continuing cost accumulation.</p>
<p>The answer to the company not moving idle labor hours being charged for nothing over to &#8220;real&#8221; work was &#8216;company policy&#8217;.</p>
<p>All the waste of US civil servants with overhead, general and administrative costs, good old boy (revolving door) management and profits. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>This one was by ILSM.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/09/crandall-canyon-one-more-time.html">Peter Dorman</a> begins his post by making the laissez faire argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>The standard theory, which can be found in any labor economics textbook and even some principles texts, is that dangerous work is essentially a non-problem. Workers will only take a dangerous job if they get extra pay to compensate. This gives employers an incentive to make jobs safer up to the point when the cost of more safety exceeds the added wages they would have to pay. The result: the level of safety is efficient (marginal benefit of safety improvements equals marginal cost), workers with a taste for risk are efficiently matched with employers whose technologies make risk harder to reduce, and workers in dangerous jobs are no worse off than those in safe ones, since they have bigger bank accounts to keep them happy. There are two big regulatory implications: interference, like enforcing safety rules, is against the interest of both workers and employers, and the wage-safety tradeoff can be used to calculate a “value of statistical life”, which comes in handy whenever cost-benefit analyses need to be performed. I kid you not. The “consensus” view in the profession is that a wealth of empirical data validates this theory. The Environmental Protection Agency holds earnest discussions on whether the value of a life should be raised or lowered a bit, or perhaps set at a higher level for some groups (like the rich) compared to others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter sort of trashed this in his <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521553067">book</a> from eleven years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>This book provides a critical survey of conventional economic approaches to occupational safety and the analysis of environmental risk in general. The author concludes that unsafe work is not voluntary, that markets do not compensate workers for risk, and that attempts to put a monetary value on life and health are futile. He attributes the shortcomings of economic orthodoxy to its underlying approach to human decision-making and social interaction, and demonstrates that useful alternative approaches are available. The analysis is used to identify policies that combine effective regulation with democratic values.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My father is a physcist. But when I decided to study economics, he started paying a bit of attention to the field so we&#8217;d have something to talk about. At one point, he told me: &#8220;Economics now is where Physics was before Galileo.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about that, and I&#8217;d like to expand on the theme. Right now, Economics is bull$%!#. Plain and simple. And it is bull$%!# for the same reason physics was bull$%!#&#8230; because people prefer to believe in myth than reality, and so many institutions crop up to defend those myths so strongly that a) even those people who would prefer to believe in reality never get exposed to it under the relentless weight of &#8220;experts&#8221; telling them what reality really is and b) those that manage to figure out what reality is usually find it best to keep their mouth shut.</p>
<p>And, just as before (and in the centuries after) Galileo, the acceptable &#8220;physics&#8221; myths varied by location, our acceptable economics (and I&#8217;m not putting economics in quotes the way I put physics in quotes &#8211; we know what physics really is, but I don&#8217;t think any of us know what real economics might really look like)&#8230; in some countries, prices can be frozen or set by government fiat, in others, (such as our own) cutting taxes and shrinking government always produces more growth. </p>
<p>I want to focus on the myths we believe in here in the US&#8230; we have fewer excuses than folks elsewhere. After all, supposedly we are free to open our mouth and make up our own minds, so we should be the most free to arrive at some form of economics that is &#8220;right.&#8221; And we worship technology enough to have made the data easily available&#8230;. its all there, at the BEA, the OMB, the BLS, the IRS, and so forth. And we all have access to computers and spreadsheets (no need for fancy statistics, just as there really was no need for fancy Latin prayers to determine whether you can transmute lead into gold) when Galileo was running around.</p>
<p>As I noted the other day&#8230; perhaps the most important question in economics, as it stands now, is what leads to faster growth&#8230; in particular, what is the optimal size of government, or what are the tax rates that lead to the fastest possible growth. And in fact, there are a lot of very well funded organizations and think tanks and universities that produce carefully worded studies that address these topics. But they generally find&#8230; we have to cut taxes more, and decrease the size of government.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m no academic (despite the 5 years adjuncting), and I&#8217;m certainly not angling for a position in academia, but I think what would happen to someone in any of the think tanks who pointed out that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/tax-rates-and-economic-growth-look-at.html">growth rates are higher at much, much higher tax rates than we observe now, and tax cuts have not usually led to faster growth rates than tax hikes</a>. No theorizing, just pointing out the data. Because we all know that tax cuts and smaller government lead to faster growth (aren&#8217;t Republicans supposed to be better for the economy?), even though we have over a hundred years of experience watching Alabama and Massachusetts. </p>
<p>But a lot of people know what the data shows&#8230; but they don&#8217;t say a word. Anyone think the Dean of the business school and the Harvard Professor that advised the current president on the economy and are now advising the front runner on the Republican side don&#8217;t know what the data shows?</p>
<p>In the end&#8230; the reason economics is bull$%!# is because the practitioners have allowed it to remain bull$%!#. And this is a problem&#8230; how many people died because physics remained bull$%!# for so long? And chemistry? And biology? How much further along would we be if things had changed centuries earlier? And the same is true of economics. How much farther along would we be if every president since WW2 had achieve JFK/LBJ&#8217;s growth rates? Or failing that, Clinton&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; this is not a game. Any movement toward and not away from the optimal tax rates and optimal size of government makes us better off, and movements away from the optima hurt us.  The people who choose to perpetuate the myths and the bull$%!# are harming the country. What does that say about the ones that are smart enough to know they are perpetuating myths and the bull$%!#?</p>

<blockquote><p>More than four years after declaring &#8221; Mission Accomplished&#8221; in Iraq, Bush still can&#8217;t make an announced visit to the war-wracked country.</p>
<p>But his supposed &#8220;visit to Anbar Province&#8221; was in some ways even more cynical &#8212; and accepted even more gullibly by the media &#8212; than his June 2006 visit to Baghdad. There, at least, he actually set foot on Iraqi soil.</p>
<p>This time, Bush visited Al-Asad Air Base &#8212; an enormous, heavily fortified American outpost for 10,000 troops that while technically in Anbar Province in fact has a 13-mile perimeter keeping Iraq &#8212; and Iraqis &#8212; at bay. Bush never left the confines of the base, known as &#8220;Camp Cupcake,&#8221; for its relatively luxurious facilities, but nevertheless announced: &#8220;When you stand on the ground here in Anbar and hear from the people who live here, you can see what the future of Iraq can look like.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
