                                <p>In graduate school, required reading included <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Economic-Analysis-Enlarged-Harvard/dp/0674313038">Foundations of Economic Analysis</a>, which was published by Paul Samuelson in 1947.  But most of us recall how much the use of mathematics assisted our understanding of economic theory even from our undergraduate texts.  </p>
<p><a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/09/why-we-use-math.html">Dani Rodrik</a> recalls when he was getting his masters degree:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I tell them a story about Sir W. Arthur Lewis. When I was a master&#8217;s student myself at Princeton, I once attended a lecture that he gave on real wages, the commodity terms of trade, and North-South income differentials.  The talk had no math in it. One of the younger faculty members of the economics department was sitting in the front row, and I could see him scratching his head in confusion throughout the talk.  A few minutes after Sir Arthur was done, this young professor jumped up in excitement and went up to the board. &#8220;Now I get it!&#8221; he exclaimed and began to scribble some equations on the board.  &#8220;This is the equation which relates to what you said in the first part of your talk, and this one expresses the other, and here is a third&#8230; and now finally we have three independent equations that determines your three endogenous variables&#8230;&#8221;  Sir Arthur kept on his bemused smile as his lecture was explained to him in mathematical terms. The moral of the story is that if you are smart enough to be a Nobel-prize winning economist maybe you can do without the math, but the rest of us mere mortals cannot. We need the math to make sure that we think straight&#8211;to ensure that our conclusions follow from our premises and that we haven&#8217;t left loose ends hanging in our argument.  In other words, we use math not because we are smart, but because we are not smart enough. We are just smart enough to recognize that we are not smart enough. And this recognition, I tell our students, will set them apart from a lot of people out there with very strong opinions about what to do about poverty and underdevelopment.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A big problem in health care is the non-compliant patient. Non-compliance can be in the form of disobeying orders or advice, or simply by blowing off doctor visits (if you don’t hear the bad news it isn’t news, right?).</p>
<p>Well, maybe there is a solution.</p>
<p>Presidential candidate John Edwards says that under his universal health care program everyone WILL see the doctor for preventive care. Women WILL have mammograms.</p>
<p>No word on the enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>In the UK, a panel of Conservative MPs have a recommendation that Brits who live an unhealthy lifestyle should not receive certain types of care. The healthy lifestyle initiative would also be tied to health care service reforms and various social initiatives including housing and schooling reforms.</p>
<p>Brits who live healthy lifestyles would be rewarded by receving points to be used for vegetables and gym memberships.</p>
<p>Is this the future of health care? Slightly Orwellian?</p>
<p>No word if Edwards will give us veggies.</p>
<p>Seriously, is this the way to deal with non-compliance? Is there a better way?</p>

<blockquote><p>Buyers from the nation’s leading department stores will sift through the work of hundreds of designers as another Fashion Week begins today in New York, seeking the looks that shoppers will want to wear next spring. Seema Anand will be looking for the ones they want right now.  Ms. Anand, who will be following the catwalk shows through photographs posted instantly on the Web, is a designer few would recognize, even though she has dressed more people than most of the famous designers exhibiting a few blocks from her garment district studio, under the tents in Bryant Park. “If I see something on Style.com, all I have to do is e-mail the picture to my factory and say, ‘I want something similar, or a silhouette made just like this,’ ” Ms. Anand said. The factory, in Jaipur, India, can deliver stores a knockoff months before the designer version. Ms. Anand compared a gold sequined tunic she created with a nearly identical one by the designer Tory Burch. Bloomingdale’s had asked her to make several hundred of the dresses for its private label Aqua, she said. The Tory Burch dress sells for $750; Ms. Anand’s is $260. Ms. Anand’s company, Simonia Fashions, is one of hundreds that make less expensive clothes inspired by other designers’ runway looks, for trendy stores like Forever 21 and retail behemoths like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem some in the industry don’t like competition and what the Federal government to outlaw it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A debate is raging in the American fashion industry over such designs. Copying, which has always existed in fashion, has become so pervasive in the Internet era it is now the No. 1 priority of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which is lobbying Congress to extend copyright protection to clothing. Nine senators introduced a bill last month to support the designers. An expert working with the designers’ trade group estimates that knockoffs represent a minimum of 5 percent of the $181 billion American apparel market.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=designer_fashion_the_benefits">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>While designers would predictably be unhappy with this situation, the availability of low cost copies of designer fashions would lead to substantial economic gains, just as lowering tariffs leads to economic gains.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A story about Iraq in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-surge4sep04,0,2280359,full.story?coll=la-home-center">LA Times</a> includes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>People who describe their neighborhoods as calm often attribute this to the sectarian &#8220;cleansing&#8221; of Sunnis or Shiites. Many say that better security is attributable to a heavy U.S. presence in their neighborhoods and that whenever those troops scale down operations, trouble returns.</p>
<p>Hamid Abdul Kareem, a supermarket owner in the northeastern neighborhood of Shaab, said the area was relatively secure. He said that was because of an exodus of Sunni families from Shaab, where the Mahdi Army loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr has a strong presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunnis still live in the region, but I think within the next year, the region will be totally Shiite,&#8221; Kareem said.</p>
<p>Hassan Shimari is one such Sunni. He lives in Shaab with his wife, a Shiite. He also wears a beard and is grateful for his dark complexion because it makes him look more Shiite than Sunni.</p>
<p>He said Shaab was quiet because Sunnis were lying low and because there was still enough of an American presence there to keep Shiite militias under control.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any weakening of the American forces here, it will be very, very bad,&#8221; said Shimari, a taxi driver. &#8220;In the last three days, I&#8217;ve driven four families at 6 in the morning to travel companies so they could leave for Syria. Those who can afford it leave.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Determining accurate civilian death tolls is virtually impossible in Iraq, where the government has no single source for reporting deaths related to the war. Whichever numbers one uses, however, it is clear that thousands of Iraqis continue to be slain or driven from their homes.</p>
<p>According to U.S. military figures, an average of 1,000 Iraqis have died each month since March in sectarian violence. That compares with about 1,200 a month at the start of the security plan, the military said in an e-mailed response to queries. This does not include deaths from car bombings, which the military said have numbered more than 2,600 this year.</p>
<p>Figures from Iraqi government ministries point to far higher casualty numbers and show that this year, an average of 1,724 civilians a month have died in sectarian attacks, bombings and other war-related violence.</p>
<p>In February, the civilian death toll was 1,646. Last month, it was 1,773, according to numbers from officials in the ministries of Defense, Interior and Health, who cite morgue, hospital and police reports. It was the second straight month that casualties have increased since the security plan began.</p>
<p>Dana Graber-Ladek of the International Organization for Migration said internal displacement had escalated since the troop buildup began. The increase is partly because of people fleeing military offensives, and partly because of better record-keeping by the Ministry for Displacement and Migration, Graber-Ladek said.</p>
<p>But 63% of those displaced this year said they had moved because of threats to their security, according to the International Organization for Migration. One-fourth said they were forced from their homes.</p>
<p>The organization also said that 69% of newly displaced Iraqis had left homes in Baghdad, a sign that sectarian cleansing continues in the capital. These people had either moved to new neighborhoods in the capital or had left Baghdad altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, Iraqis are fleeing because they flee for their lives,&#8221; Graber-Ladek said. &#8220;As long as the violence continues, displacement will continue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the US stays long enough, there will be peace in Iraq&#8230; because everyone the &#8220;cleansers&#8221; want to cleanse will be cleansed. Of course, that will also happen if the US leaves tomorrow.  I don&#8217;t recall any of this being part of the rationale for war.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the relationship between tax rates and economic growth. Because this is a controversial subject, I will approach this methodically, and also (where possible) approach the problem (and the solution) from more than one angle. It makes for a long post, so be forewarned. If you want to read it, make sure your chair is comfortable.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan… First, look at how the top marginal income tax rate, the bottom marginal income tax rate, and the top capital gains tax rate evolved over time beginning in Ike’s term graphically. Next, look at the growth rate of real GDP per capita observed at these different tax rates. Where possible, when a “maximum” or optimal point is uncovered, use correlations between tax rates and growth rates to confirm whether that point truly is a maximum. </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA BEA Table 7.1</a>. The highest and lowest marginal tax rates come from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf">this IRS document</a>. Capital gains tax rates come from <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>. Regular readers are aware I prefer to get data directly from the source, but after 30 minutes I didn’t find the time series on the IRS website. I’m sure its there, I’m just not finding it. That said, the data does seem to match my recollections, and while Citizens for Tax Justice might be a biased source, I suspect they got the data right. </p>
<p>So let’s start by looking at how these tax rates have evolved over time…</p>

<p>We can group the top rates into a few categories…. There are many ways to skin a cat, so to speak, but I think a natural division (trying to keep bunches of tax rates together, and where possible, trying to keep the bunches more or less of the same size) might be the following:</p>
<p>Group 1: 90% to 93%, 11 observations<br />Group 2: 78% to 69%, 18 observations<br />Group 3: 60% to 50%, 5 observations<br />Group 4: 40% to 36%, 11 observations<br />Group 5: 36% to 25%, 9 observations</p>
<p>Similarly, the bottom marginal rates could probably be grouped as follows:</p>
<p>Group 1: 20% to 23%, 11 observations<br />Group 2: 15% to 20%, 14 observations<br />Group 3: 14% to 15%, 17 observations<br />Group 4: 11% to 14%, 6 observations<br />Group 5: 10% to 11%, 6 observations</p>
<p>Finally, we can group the capital gains tax into the following categories:</p>
<p>Group 1, 35% to 40%, 7 observations<br />Group 2, 30% to 35%, 5 observations<br />Group 3, 25% to 30%, 26 observations<br />Group 4, 20% to 25%, 12 observations<br />Group 5, 15% to 20%, 4 observations</p>
<p>Admittedly, other divisions are possible, but for the most part, unless one’s intent is some serious cherry picking, it won’t make much a different to much of what we’re going to do on the rest of the post. (I’ve tried a few breakdowns for grins but I’m not including them due to the length of the post.) </p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the top marginal rate and how it compares to growth rates since 1953…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMy09FI3I/AAAAAAAAAr4/XCPGqqYr8NU/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMy09FI3I/AAAAAAAAAr4/XCPGqqYr8NU/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What we see is that when the rate is “too high”, growth rates are pretty low – presumably this is because the high tax rates discourage private enterprise. Similarly, when tax rates are “too low”, growth rates are low – this is probably because in such instances, the government shrinks too much to provide services essential to economic growth, or it must borrow heavily to finance its activities. (Put another way… taxes are too high when the private sector can make better use of a marginal dollar than the government, and they are too low when the government can make better use of a marginal dollar than the private sector.) So what’s the happy medium? Highest observed growth rates occurred when the top marginal rte was between 50% and 60%. And the shape of the distribution seems to bear out that this range is the optimum.</p>
<p>But this could be mere coincidence. Luck and whatever else. Its certainly heresy to anyone who has ever voted Republican. So its worth taking another bite at this apple. And here’s how we’ll do it. If there is a such a relationship, call it a “Laffer curve for growth”, then at points to the left of the optimum, we should expect, on average, that increasing the tax rates should lead to faster growth rates, and at points to the right of the optimum, we should expect, on average, that decreasing the tax rate should lead to faster growth rates. Put another way, when tax rates are below the optimum, the tax rate will be positively correlated with growth. Conversely, when tax rates are above the optimal level, we would expect to see the tax rate negatively correlated with growth.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing that relationship…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNK09FI7I/AAAAAAAAAsY/FXobEWrH2LE/s1600-h/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNK09FI7I/AAAAAAAAAsY/FXobEWrH2LE/s320/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The first row can be interpreted as follows… when the top marginal tax rates are equal to or lower than 39%, the correlation between the top marginal tax rates and the growth in real GDP per capita is equal to –0.08. Similarly, the correlation between tax rates and growth rates is 0.02 when tax rates are above 39%. Anyway, none of the correlations are especially high – not surprising given the fact that we’re only looking at one variable (i.e., top marginal tax rate) to explain growth, but nevertheless, the signs of the correlations are as we expect for the range we’re observing, and the highest sum of absolute lower and higher correlations seem to occur in the range the earlier graph led us to expect.</p>
<p>Thus, given the historical data, it seems that a) the fastest growth rates were observed when marginal tax rates were between 50% and 60%, and a simple test of correlations provides a bit of support to the hypothesis that the tax rate that provides the fastest growth is indeed somewhere in the vicinity. Is this conclusive evidence? Heck no – I’m well aware people much smarter than I have used far more sophisticated tools to do this sort of work, but as time goes on I’m more and more convinced of the value of using simple tools. One thing I think is evident from the graph and the correlations… there isn’t much in the data to support having the top marginal tax rate at the current 35% rate if one wants to encourage growth, and there is even less in the data to support cutting the top marginal tax rates any more as some Presidential candidates have advocated.</p>
<p>Moving along, we do the same thing for the bottom marginal rate. Here’s the graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMuU9FI2I/AAAAAAAAArw/etvQf4iBDcs/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMuU9FI2I/AAAAAAAAArw/etvQf4iBDcs/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that again we get the familiar bow shaped curve. And once again, the optimum is evident… somewhere in the neighborhood of 11% to 14%. Which in fact, is not too far distant from the range which we’ve seen in the not very distant past. (And for the economists among us… charging low income people lower rates than the high income individuals makes sense – the former have a higher marginal propensity to consume, so the multiplier effect is going to be much larger when their tax rates are very low relative to the tax rates faced by those with high incomes. Personally, I think taxes should go on wealth and not income, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>Now the correlations between the lowest marginal income tax rates and real GDP per capita…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNGU9FI6I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/zakEGksiTbI/s1600-h/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNGU9FI6I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/zakEGksiTbI/s320/correlations+between+tax+rates+and+growth+rates,+Graph+2+-+Bottom+Marginal+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Seems the 11% to 14% range looks most plausible closer to the 11% rate.</p>
<p>Now what about capital gains tax rates? Here’s the picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMpE9FI1I/AAAAAAAAAro/X01q1ZGy0QM/s1600-h/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzMpE9FI1I/AAAAAAAAAro/X01q1ZGy0QM/s320/Tax+Rates+and+Growth+Rates,+Graph+3+-+Capital+Gains+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, we have a problem… it seems we don’t have the familiar bow shape … it may be because we simply haven’t observed rates larger than the optimum, because while the graph suggests 20% to 25% may constitute a local optimum, it also suggests that the overall optimum is at least in the 35% to 40% range. Sadly, the shape of this curve precludes much of a correlation analysis – we simply don’t have observations above the 35% to 40% range. </p>
<p>What we learn from this is that regardless of how one chooses to interpret the graph, the current 15% capital gains tax is way too low – keeping tax rates that low is reducing economic growth and hurting us all, including those who pay taxes on capital gains. (In the short term they may be better off paying less in capital gains, but it comes at a cost of less economic growth which in turn decreases their income opportunities.) </p>
<p>This post is getting way too long, but I want to add in a few details… I want to check the results of tax cuts themselves, and compare them to tax hikes.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the median and average growth rates in the year of a cut in the highest marginal tax rate, the year after such a tax cut, two years after such a tax cut, three years after a tax cut, and four years after such a tax cut. It also shows the same after a tax hike. (Note… there have been instances where a change in tax rates in one direction was quickly followed by a change in tax rates in the other direction, one or two years later. For instance, in 1969, there was a tax hike, followed by a tax cut in 1970. I count the tax hike in 1969, but don’t count 1970 as one year following a tax hike or 1971 as two years following a tax hike since the more recent tax cut nullifies the hike. Note also.. there have been 12 cuts in the highest marginal rate, and four hikes in the sample.) </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNAk9FI5I/AAAAAAAAAsI/FjG76oEgTqg/s1600-h/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Tax+Rate.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RtzNAk9FI5I/AAAAAAAAAsI/FjG76oEgTqg/s320/Tax+Cuts+and+Tax+Increases,+Graph+1+-+Top+Marginal+Tax+Rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does this show? Well, it shows that the economy has grown faster two years after a cut in the highest marginal tax rate than two years after a hike in the highest marginal tax rate. Similarly, it has grown faster three years after a highest marginal rate tax cut than three years after a highest marginal rate tax hike. But&#8230; growth rates are slower in the year of a highest marginal tax cut than the year of a highest marginal rate tax hike, as well as one year out and four years out. This isn’t much data, but its clearly not exactly evidence that cutting the highest marginal tax rates is any kind of a growth producer.</p>
<p>What about cutting the lowest marginal rate? Well, there’s only one year in which there was a tax cut, so it kind of not instructive.</p>
<p>What about cutting the capital gains tax rate? Seven cuts, eight hikes…</p>

<p>Results are similar to cutting the highest marginal rate. Put another way&#8230; in the five years beginning with a change to the tax rate, tax cuts are associated with faster growth than tax hikes 40% of the time, and with slower growth than tax hikes 60% of the time. </p>
<p>Cuts beat hikes 2 years out and 3 years out, and are beaten year of, year after, and are walloped 4 years out. Again… cutting the capital gains tax rate isn’t exactly a formula for super duper growth.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what can we conclude from all this? Well, there isn&#8217;t much evidence that cutting tax rates, at least to high income earners and on capital gains, will lead to faster growth. In fact, it would seem that since Nixon&#8217;s time, tax rates have been below the &#8220;optimal&#8221; level for generating growth, possibly even leading to slower growth over the past thirty five years or so. </p>
<p>This post may go some way toward explaining why since Ike took office, Democratic Presidents have generally produced faster rates of growth in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real GDP per capita</a> than their Republican counterparts. Some time soon I’m going to look at that in more detail.</p>
<p>(Note to regular readers who may be wondering why I did the entire analysis for real GDP per capita, as opposed to my favorite measure, real (GDP – change in the national debt) per capita. Basically, I wanted this to be as easy to replicate as possible. Also, those parts of the analysis I did using that measure of growth were even more damning of the “tax cutting” philosophy.)</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Nouriel Roubini&#8217;s excellent blog touched upon a subject that is sure to become more prominent as time goes by: <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/213189">Soverign Wealth Funds.</a></p>
<p>While we may think that SWF&#8217;s are merely big piggy banks out to buy foreign assets (think China-Blackstone), they can also be national companies themselves. Implicit in Nouriel&#8217;s definition of SWF&#8217;s are publically owned companies such as CNOC and Dubai Ports. These are nationally owned companies, created, financed, and protected by governments.</p>
<p>Nourel states that SWF’s need to allow their currencies to float so that do not need to buy (or create?) such assets. Focusing merely on the currency issue may preclude us from seeing a deeper rationale for the need to purchase or create such as assets. Following are some possibilities:
<ol>
<li>SWF’s are national responses to privately own multinationals. For weak or small or developing countries, they provide the capital focus to accomplish what their own privately owned firms cannot. With such focus they can compete with the multinationals.</li>
<li>Some countries view capitalistic endeavors as an extension of national and political interests. China certainly fits this description, as does Russia. Just as all countries view their armies as a means of extending power, so these countries view their national companies as an extension of economic power.
<p>(As an aside, not all these countries have fixed currencies. Brazil’s Vale do Rio Doce, for example, just bought Inco in Sudbury, Ontario—a huge nickel mine. Vale do Rio is a publically own company; Brazil has a floating exchange rate.)</p>
</li>
<li>As the battle for resources intensifies, these companies will become pivotal in protecting national interests and needs, not private ones. Markets at that point may not function as western economists have been taught to expect. Some customers or buyers may be “more equal” than others.</li>
</ol>
<p>I see the growth of SWF’s as a natural response to America’s economic domination. Size and financial muscle are necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all countries share our vision of “private” ownership. And, yes, in the case of a number of public companies, CVRD, for example, foreign interests are allowed to own a share, a modest share. But, these companies are not for sale or takeover. They will remain national companies—unless they fail miserably.</p>
<p>Of course, pegged currencies are a means of subsidizing such companies. Laws limiting foreign ownership of more than a fractional share are a means of ensuring these companies serve national, not private, interests.</p>
<p>As they become larger and more influential players on the global stage, I see them as possible inheritors of our version of capitalism. Unlike our companies, these companies will directly serve national interests and goals.</p>

<blockquote><p>GENEVA (AP) &#8211; American workers stay longer in the office, at the factory or on the farm than their counterparts in Europe and most other rich nations, and they produce more per person over the year.  They also get more done per hour than everyone but the Norwegians, according to a U.N. report released Monday, which said the United States &#8220;leads the world in labor productivity.&#8221; The average U.S. worker produces $63,885 of wealth per year, more than their counterparts in all other countries, the International Labor Organization said in its report. Ireland comes in second at $55,986, followed by Luxembourg at $55,641, Belgium at $55,235 and France at $54,609.  The productivity figure is found by dividing the country&#8217;s gross domestic product by the number of people employed. The U.N. report is based on 2006 figures for many countries, or the most recent available. Only part of the U.S. productivity growth, which has outpaced that of many other developed economies, can be explained by the longer hours Americans are putting in, the ILO said. The U.S., according to the report, also beats all 27 nations in the European Union, Japan and Switzerland in the amount of wealth created per hour of work &#8211; a second key measure of productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Twice this story used “wealth” (a stock) when referring to GDP, which is income flows.  Shouldn’t those who report on economic matters know the distinction?</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;For example, we know that in type 1 diabetes, metabolic control can reduce the risk of microvascular complications. On the other hand, the two largest randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the University Group Diabetes Program, failed to find a significant reduction in cardiovascular events even with excellent glucose control.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R2">2</a> Moreover, we are facing a troubling paradox: preliminary data that were presented at the meeting and published by Gerrits et al.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R3">3</a> suggest that among the thiazolidinediones — a class of drugs that has been shown to improve metabolic control — rosiglitazone may increase cardiovascular risk whereas pioglitazone may reduce it. Until we have a better grasp of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes, it will be difficult to design therapies to prevent this complication or even to determine how the currently available agents that act at multiple sites may affect clinical outcomes in very different ways.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, glycemic control has been the centerpiece of therapeutic interventions in type 2 diabetes for many years. Within the past decade, several new drugs that result in &#8220;glycemic durability&#8221; — a reduction in the glycated hemoglobin level — have been approved by the FDA. However, change in the glycated hemoglobin level is a relatively poor surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes, accounting for only 5 to 15% of the variation in ischemic risk.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R2">2</a> This finding represents a major dilemma for practitioners, regulatory agencies, and patients who seek the newest and best treatments for this disease.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding biochemical surrogates versus clinical outcomes was also highlighted at the FDA meeting when the advisory committee reviewed one of the largest randomized trials of rosiglitazone, A Diabetes Outcome Prevention Trial, or ADOPT. In that study, the percentage decrease in glycated hemoglobin was greater with rosiglitazone than with metformin or sulfonylureas, yet the risks of congestive heart failure and cardiovascular ischemia were higher.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R4">4</a> These data suggest that we urgently need to change the regulatory pathway for drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to make clinical outcomes, not surrogates, the primary end points. This is not a radical proposal: 20 years ago, the FDA shifted its primary efficacy end point for osteoporosis drugs from bone mineral density (a reasonable surrogate for the risk of fracture) to fractures themselves. Without a regulatory sea change with regard to diabetes drugs, we are certain to be in the same position 5 years from now that we are in now: we will again find ourselves in possession of a new wonder drug that is designed to treat a devastating chronic disease but that may do more harm than good.<br />&#8230; </p>
<p>Drugs are approved or removed from the market on the basis of evidence from randomized, controlled trials. In the FDA hearing on rosiglitazone, several meta-analyses (see <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#T1">Table 1</a>) revealed a significant increase in the risk of myocardial ischemic events among patients taking rosiglitazone. However, an interim analysis of the ongoing Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes (RECORD) trial, which was designed specifically to assess cardiovascular risk among patients receiving rosiglitazone, failed to demonstrate a similar risk.<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#R5">5</a> In addition, two large observational studies, one conducted by Tricare for the Department of Defense and one conducted by WellPoint (the largest health insurer in the United States), noted no appreciable signal of increased cardiovascular risk with either of the available thiazolidinediones (see <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/9/844?query=TOC#T2">Table 2</a>). The contrasts among the levels of evidence and the results regarding the safety of rosiglitazone raised new questions about relative and absolute risks but also highlighted the weaknesses of observational studies examining events that are common and whose rates are likely to be increased only slightly by a given drug, even in a large cohort (such as that used by WellPoint, which comprised 160,000 patient records).<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>This issue led to an interesting sidelight at the meeting. Recently, there have been calls for the FDA to fund and oversee phase 4 postmarketing studies as a means of determining the safety of newly approved drugs. The two observational studies on thiazolidinediones whose results were presented at our meeting had been performed independently of the manufacturers and the FDA. The indeterminacy of their results, due to the inevitable effects of the many confounding variables inherent in such studies, illustrates why this approach alone will neither solve the overriding problems of drug safety nor ultimately help a chronically underfunded federal agency. There is no doubt that it will be costly to undertake true safety and efficacy studies of new drugs using clinical outcomes as primary measures, but in the long run, these efforts will save time, energy, and money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such reading is difficult for non-medical, but the thought is clear. The same theme is presented that proper testing is severely deficient and apt to get false negatives for safety as part of the design. It is unlikely that companies would furnish or finish appropriate testing for followup safety concerns that have NO longitudinal studies done. There is a growing share of the market that is tweaking current medications for the sake of patent production and sales but reveal little improvement in efficacy and actual concern of harm.</p>
<p>The gardasil vaccine is innovative and has been approved of course, but the immense pressure to get to market before a rival company predisposes companies to push increasingly more quickly and with greater &#8216;advertising&#8217; (a governor advocating mandatory vaccination!) that turns the market into a medical experiment of large proportion.</p>
<p>(Next stop is in India where generic antibiotics are made to lower our costs for drugs)</p>

                                <p>A big hat tip to AB reader Ken Melvin who reminds me I should read <a href="http://www.mahablog.com/2007/08/31/the-road-to-serfdom">Mahablog</a> more often.  In light if the clown show from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/turning-their-backs-on-nola.html">Kudlow</a>, we should all read what <a href="http://welcome-to-pottersville.blogspot.com/2007/08/paul-krugman-katrina-all-time.html">Paul Krugman</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, much of the Gulf Coast remains in ruins. Less than half the federal money set aside for rebuilding, as opposed to emergency relief, has actually been spent, in part because the Bush administration refused to waive the requirement that local governments put up matching funds for recovery projects — an impossible burden for communities whose tax bases have literally been washed away. On the other hand, generous investment tax breaks, supposedly designed to spur recovery in the disaster area, have been used to build luxury condominiums near the University of Alabama’s football stadium in Tuscaloosa, 200 miles inland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tax-free enterprise zones – my arse.  This is something seriously wrong with this Administration and those National Review cheerleaders for this garbage</p>

<blockquote><p>How much money has Uncle Sam spent on New Orleans and the Gulf region since Hurricane Katrina ripped the place apart?  I’ll give you the answer because you’ll never guess it. The grand total is $127 billion (including tax relief). That’s right: a monstrous $127 billion. Of course, not a single media story has highlighted this gargantuan government-spending figure. But that number came straight from the White House in a fact sheet subtitled, “The Federal Government Is Fulfilling Its Commitment to Help the People of the Gulf Coast Rebuild.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the press has been covering this issue and reports that the other state in the Gulf region is being treated better than Louisiana.  But Kudlow can’t even begin to tell you that his statistic includes Mississippi.  </p>
<p>Kudlow wants his readers to believe that the fact that Louisiana is still not rebuilt despite the fact that PART of this $127 billion went to the state is a “quintessential failure of that liberal vision.  I guess Larry never figured out how much damage was done by Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the Bush Administration to act quickly.  No – Kudlow wants to attack the War on Poverty as he endorses the wonders of tax-free enterprise zones.  Incidentally, his <a href="http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=46294">own source</a> admits that the actual spending is far below this $127 billion: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Government Has Provided More Than $114 Billion In Resources – $127 Billion Including Tax Relief – To The Gulf Region. Over $96 Billion Of The $114 Billion (84 Percent) Either Has Been Disbursed Or Is Available For States To Draw From.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the disaster in New Orleans were not so tragic, the stupidity and mendacity of Mr. Kudlow would be comical.  But is he pushing so new GOP agenda – which is usually his excuse for lying to his readers?  <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/052096.php">Steven Benen</a> is on this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently, on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina ravaging the Gulf Coast, conservatives have decided they&#8217;ve grown tired of the topic &#8230; That would be the same federal government, of course, that neglected the victims before the storm hit, as the storm hit, after the storm hit, and for the two subsequent years that followed. Indeed, for all the rhetoric we&#8217;ve heard, as of this week, &#8220;none of the 115 &#8216;critical priority projects&#8217; identified by city officials&#8221; for publicly funded rebuilding efforts &#8220;has been completed.&#8221; Of the $34 billion &#8220;earmarked for long-term rebuilding,&#8221; less than half &#8220;has made its way through federal checks and balances to reach municipal projects.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoops – a few facts Kudlow forgot to mention! Steve links to comments from <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/tancredo-slams-katrina-spending-2007-08-31.html">Tom Tancredo</a> and <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/JohnHawkins/2007/08/31/its_time_to_get_over_katrina_already?page=full&#038;comments=true">John Hawkins</a>.  There does seem to be an orchestrated effort to trash the victims of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
