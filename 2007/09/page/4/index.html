                                <p>The Ex-GF was just in the supermarket.  (This is a big chain, not a mom-and-pop.)  The woman ahead of her in the check-out line wanted to pay her bills with a few rolls of nickels.  The supermarket&#8217;s position was that they would not accept payment of this sort.  The Ex-GF, who can be a bit combative at times, butted in and noted that nickels qualify as legal tender.  </p>
<p>Question&#8230;  is it even legal to refuse to accept payment for goods and services received in United States currency?  (I imagine it would be awfully hard for most websites to accept currency.  I also think of times when I was in South America and merchants displayed a strong preference for the greenback over the domestic paper.)</p>

                                <p>The LA Times carries <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-fg-iraq22sep22,1,28804.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">this story</a> this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The security company Blackwater USA was approved Friday to resume escorting American officials in Baghdad, just days after the fatal shooting of 11 Iraqis galvanized the Iraqi government over the company&#8217;s conduct and the immunity its employees enjoy from Iraqi law.</p>
<p>The decision by the U.S. Embassy came despite Prime Minister Nouri Maliki&#8217;s insistence that the State Department sack the company and his government&#8217;s demand that Blackwater and other such security firms be stripped of the immunity granted them in 2004 by L. Paul Bremer III, the administrator of the former U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes&#8230;  if the Soviet Union&#8217;s embassy to a Warsaw Pact country decided to do X in 1977 would it really matter what that country&#8217;s government or people wanted one whit?</p>
<p>But no doubt some sort of a statement would be made&#8230; something that made it sound like the locals were in charge.  Something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This morning, we resumed taking requests for movements. The idea was to have limited movements outside the Green Zone. Obviously this was a step taken in consultation with the Iraqi authorities,&#8221; said embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the word &#8220;consultation.&#8221;  Because the Soviet, er, US embassy wants to pretend it isn&#8217;t calling the shots.  So they follow up by having one of the useful puppets within the &#8220;host&#8221; country&#8217;s government called up to make a statement to add some verisimilitude.  Unfortunately, the ham-handed commissars always need to add in one more dig &#8211; even when trying to add the illusion of self-determination, its important to make it clear who is calling the shots lest anyone forget:</p>
<blockquote><p>A senior Iraqi lawmaker, Sami Askari, said officials would be informed of Blackwater&#8217;s whereabouts, but Nantongo denied that the embassy would be providing them precise details of their missions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, whether you want to say things are going well in Iraq or not, and whether you believe the Surge is working or not, can we at least stop pretending the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people today have any more relevance or ability to make decisions than the government of Poland and the Polish people during the Brezhnev era?</p>

<p>Update&#8230; <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/09/21/blackwater-back-to-work-in-iraq/">Crooks and Liars</a> links to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070922/ap_on_go_co/us_blackwater_probe_8;_ylt=AgDaYxCSuHn7_RIHtdf89BQE1vAI">another Blackwater related story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal prosecutors are investigating whether employees of the private security firm Blackwater USA illegally smuggled into Iraq weapons that may have been sold on the black market and ended up in the hands of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Raleigh, N.C., is handling the investigation with help from Pentagon and State Department auditors, who have concluded there is enough evidence to file charges, the officials told The Associated Press. Blackwater is based in Moyock, N.C.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>According to officials in Washington, the investigation grew from internal Pentagon and State Department inquiries into U.S. weapons that had gone missing in Iraq. It gained steam after Turkish authorities protested to the U.S. in July that they had seized American arms from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, rebels.</p>
<p>The Turks provided serial numbers of the weapons to U.S. investigators, said a Turkish official.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said in late July it was looking into the Turkish complaints and a U.S. official said FBI agents had traveled to Turkey in recent months to look into cases of missing U.S. weapons in Iraq.</p>
<p>Investigators are determining whether the alleged Blackwater weapons match those taken from the PKK.</p>
<p>It was not clear if Blackwater employees suspected of selling to the black market knew the weapons they allegedly sold to middlemen might wind up with the PKK. If they did, possible charges against them could be more serious than theft or illegal weapons sales, officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve got all sorts of warm-and-fuzzies for Blackwater right now&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/12962.html">Steve Benen</a>, two stories&#8230;</p>
<p>The first, from <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2007/09/us_resumes_blackwater_convoys.php">TPM</a>, indicates that Blackwater is up and running in Iraq again.  Apparently the Iraqi government doesn&#8217;t want them there and they&#8217;re not subject to Iraqi laws.  Maliki may be a corrupt thug, and certainly no Imre Nagy or Alexander Dubček, but I bet most Iraqis can guess what it must have felt like to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956">Hungarian in 1956</a> or   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring">a Czechoslovakian in the tail end of August 1968</a>.  </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/washington/21contract.html?ei=5088&#038;en=6ff5d60f1fe4df5e&#038;ex=1348027200&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;adxnnlx=1190378989-WeJh6ZnO6%20aifp79s3osqQ">this story</a> in the NY Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>Military officials said Thursday that contracts worth $6 billion to provide essential supplies to American troops in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan — including food, water and shelter — were under review by criminal investigators, double the amount the Pentagon had previously disclosed.</p>
<p>In addition, $88 billion in contracts and programs, including those for body armor for American soldiers and matériel for Iraqi and Afghan security forces, are being audited for financial irregularities, the officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between providing arms to the enemy, incompetence, and corruption on a massive scale, its a wonder this war is being prosecuted as inexpensively as it is.  I gotta give GW props for that.</p>

                                <p>Reader John Thompson points to a post at <a href="http://agonist.org/ian_welsh/20070919/the_saudis_call_bernankes_bluff">The Agonist</a> discussing the fact that the Saudis, for the first time, are not cutting rates in lock step with the US.  Put another way&#8230; this is what you expect to see when the Saudis are preparing to break the peg between their currency and the US dollar.  (Which, incidentally, means oil would probably not be priced in dollars much longer either.)</p>
<p>The Agonist then goes on to suggest that the right thing for Bernanke to do, right now, is raise rates, not lower them.  Anyway, its a post worth reading.</p>
<p>I would only add&#8230; there&#8217;s nothing magical about the US dollar.  There used to be another de facto world currency &#8211; the pound sterling.  There was much pain in Britain for a long time after the pound sterling fell from grace.  Part of that caused by the fall from grace, part caused by the factors that led to that fall.  And as I said, there&#8217;s nothing magical about the US dollar.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;not only is Blackwater immunized from liability under any Iraqi law, but the State Department has allowed it to operate under less restrictive rules of engagement than any other private military company. As a result, the State Department bears responsibility for the culture of impunity that resulted.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, Congress passed a law placing contractors under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law that establishes legal conduct for U.S. forces. Little follow-on work has established what exactly that means for private security companies, however. While the Pentagon has issued a number of so-called fragmentary orders seeking to regulate the private security firms, Blackwater is exempt, since its contracts are with the State Department and CIA. Blackwater isn&#8217;t required to keep the U.S. military command informed of its operations or file incident reports to it.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Anyone who says, as I did a few times, that the Surge doesn&#8217;t seem to be working gets asked some variation of the same question&#8230;  &#8220;Why should I believe you rather than David Petraeus, the top military officer in Iraq?&#8221;</p>
<p>Its a fair question.  After all, presumably Petraeus has access to more and better information, and as a military guy, on the ground, he has more familiarity and a better feel for what is going on.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some of us pointed out back in January that the Surge wasn&#8217;t going to produce results.  Now, if you think the Surge is working, that means nothing.  But we can go farther back..  Some of us have been pointing out for a while that things were getting worse&#8230; while those that were at that time the military commanders in Iraq were saying otherwise.   Some of us even expected things to become a mess in Iraq in 2003 based on what we had seen our leaders do in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So perhaps the relevant question is not&#8230;  what right do these doubters have to question the wisdom of David Petraues, but rather&#8230; why should we take the word of a guy who is saying the same things as the folks who have been wrong all along over the opinion of people who have been right so far?  What makes Petraeus different than his predecessors?  The administration, and those who have been wrong on everything so far, tell us he is more brilliant than his predecessors.  But if they are capable of seeing this difference&#8230; why were his predecessors given the job before him?  I recognize there are seniority issues, but still?  Also, if he is that good, shouldn&#8217;t the tasks he was in charge of earlier have borne fruit &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t the Iraqi military be doing a good job given he was in charge of training them?</p>
<p>Now, someone might ask me&#8230;  &#8220;Well, you consider yourself an expert in a few things.  How would you feel if complete amateur questioned you on what you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;  I try to play down how much I trade on being an expert.  My business cards don&#8217;t have the letters &#8220;Ph.D.&#8221; on them.  Anywhere.  On some occasions, for some purposes, I have allowed those letters to appear after my name, but I generally avoid it.  And I don&#8217;t tend to argue based on the fact that I have worked on something for years.  (I do try to trade on my past results and what I think I can deliver going forward, which is a bit different.) Sometimes its useful or even necessary for marketing purposes &#8211; as shorthand or signal to indicate where the discussion can start &#8211; but I&#8217;m always suspicious of anyone who argues any point based on their own authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, generally (not always, but generally), one can more easily argue one&#8217;s point by being open and transparent and arguing and presenting the data that is available.  Those who keep information squirreled away usually have a reason for behaving squirrelly.  (E.g., including in one&#8217;s data points the &#8220;Great Tax Hike of 2005&#8221; (y&#8217;all remember how triumphantly GW and Tom DeLay were in the signing statement for that one, being all fiscally responsible and rubbing it in on the Dems who so wanted lower tax rates for Paris Hilton?) and the big tax increase in 1982, characterized, as only an increase can be, by a huge drop in the top marginal rate, as well as drops in the bottom marginal rate and the cap gains rate.)  </p>
<p>And there&#8217;s one more problem sign &#8211; does the person admit mistakes.  A true expert generally does, and generally does so early.  One reason is that a true expert realizes how obvious the outcome is going to be very soon to those who are informed.  Another is a true expert in a field got that way by learning, and the only way to learn is to change your opinion when you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>So yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m perfectly comfortable with people arguing with me about topics in which I think I&#8217;m an expert and they will readily admit no expertise at all.  In fact, I&#8217;m used to it.  And part of what I have to do, on a daily basis, is to try to make the point I&#8217;m making both in a way that makes sense to others who think they&#8217;re experts and to those who don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re experts.  I don&#8217;t always succeed, of course, but I like to think I do succeed reasonably often when both sides are arguing in good faith.  So why should I not be comfortable questioning experts in other fields?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/20/ldt.01.html">Lori Wallach</a> of Global Trade Watch had an interesting twist on the dangerous products coming out of developing countries, especially China, a twist that I have been interested in for the last few years: Everything goes back to our trade agreements, or more pointedly, to how entry into the WTO has been structured.</p>
<p>Because of cheap labor, little in the way of environmental or product regulations, and great tax breaks (remember: FDI companies in China paid 15% taxation, while indigenous firms, 30%), manufacturing firms fled the U.S. to third world countries. China was and still is the new economic nirvana.</p>
<p>With NAFTA, firms went to Mexico. Then came China&#8217;s entry into the WTO. China is far bigger than Mexico with a huge, disciplined labor force. (Mexico is now feeling the pressure of China&#8217;s competition.)</p>
<p>Wallach points out that companies like Mattel &#8220;pushes its suppliers, its manufacturers, its subcontractors in China to cut costs&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, we should remember that <i>Mattel is the primary manufacturer of these toys</i>. They may outsource, subcontract, call it what you will, but they are the manufacturer. Mattel makes the toys. Period. Mattel is in the business of making toys, just as Fisher-Price was. (Mattel bought Fisher-Price.)</p>
<p>If you want to trace the problem back to its roots, try it this way. Mattel, seeking the cheapest place to make its toys and to increase its profits, goes to those countries offering the greatest benefit. When the WTO welcomed China into its fold&#8211;despite the fact that there was absolutely no effective environmental or product regulatory body, no effective protection of labor standards or conditions, the WTO set the wheels in motion that led eventually to the shoddy products now issuing from China. Mattel is, of course, horrified. It&#8217;s all the fault of those careless Chinese. Bullshit.</p>
<p>Mattel is passing the buck. Mattel, I repeat, is the manufacturer. The workers in those Chinese factories make peanuts. The real pig on the block is Mattel. And who fattened this pig? WTO trade policy.</p>
<p>Who pushed for China&#8217;s entry into the WTO before China was ready? Why, our own corporations, of course. China has become an export platform before it was ready to become one.</p>
<p>Trade agreements are made for corporations, not workers or the environment, or finally not even the consumers, although the last is where the consumer finally starts to pay attention. Take a look at worker conditions and environmental conditions in the maquiladoras, a direct result of NAFTA.</p>
<p>At some point we are going to have to lay all these problems at the feet of our trade policies and, of course, the WTO.</p>
<p>Most economists refuse to look at the source of the problem: How trade policy is fashioned. Yes, they occasionally complain about how third world countries are screwed with their agricultural products or how protectionists measures are built into the agreements favoring large corporations.</p>
<p>What economists refuse to do is to look at how the game has been structured. Labor arbitrage and environmental arbitrage do not matter. Those are natural advantages that a country can offer, they would say.</p>
<p>I say they do matter&#8230;. a lot.</p>
<p>If a country despoils its environment, that despoilment affects us all. Lest you forget, China is slated this year to become the number one emitter of CO2. China&#8217;s non-CO2-pollution-clouds now have world wide reach; they are visible from outer space, great brown splotches. (The Olympics will be quite interesting.) And I have not mentioned the poisoned rivers or lands. Who profits? We do, of course: cheap products. And, of course, our companies&#8211;Intel, Mattel, Apple, etc. do. Sometimes they are directly responsible; often they simply profit indirectly: If a country pays little attention to the environment, it can afford to tax less, making doing business much cheaper.</p>
<p>If a country does not protect its workers, or does not allow them to bargain collectively, that affects every other worker in the world.</p>
<p>There are ways to globalize, to pull countries into real trade agreements that will test and reward ingenuity and hardwork.</p>
<p>Insist that the environment be protected. Insist that workers be protected. Insisting on these conditions is not being protectionist. It is acknowledging that some kinds of regulations and protections benefit of us all, Chinese as well as Americans.</p>
<p>Protectionism has never been the real issue. It&#8217;s a strawman, erected by those who do not want to discuss how trade agreements are structured.</p>

                                <p>In my Comparing Presidents series, I’ve looked at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">tax revenues, federal outlays, and the surplus and/or deficit</a> as a percentage of GDP.  But I was thinking of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/bush-rebuts-greenspans-critique-of.html">PGL’s post</a> in which we learn that according to GW, “cutting taxes… made a significant difference in dealing with the deficit because the growing economy yielded more tax revenues.”  I trust everyone reading this post knows GW is wrong about increased tax revenues.  I want to show, though, just how wrong by looking at real tax collections per capita since 1952, and also at real spending per capita over the same time period.  Not just to poke fun at GW – it seems there are a lot of misinformed people out there and I figured a picture or two are always nice in a situation like this</p>
<p>Data for this post is as follows:<br />1.  Real receipts and outlays come from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB table 1.3</a><br />2.  Population comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  I used the population for the quarter in which the fiscal year came to an end…  the second quarter until 1976, and the third quarter thereafter.  </p>
<p>Here’s a graph of tax receipts per capita. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTvK3oXaI/AAAAAAAAAsw/W_98Wgdh3Eg/s1600-h/Tax+Receipts+-+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita+(2000+dollars).jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTvK3oXaI/AAAAAAAAAsw/W_98Wgdh3Eg/s320/Tax+Receipts+-+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita+(2000+dollars).jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hmmmm… Looks like there was, if anything, a drop in real tax revenues per capita.  Sure, since revenues bottomed out in 2003, real revenues per person have risen sharply… but in 2006, the last year for which we have data, they still were less than they had been in 2000, and 2001.  Now, GW would blame the recession, but that ended in November of 2001.  Presumably if the recession was at fault, the bottom would have been in 2001 or 2002 (depending on whether wage earners or those who pay their taxes quarterly got hit the hardest).  Regardless, it wouldn’t have been in 2003.  Ditto using 9/11 as an excuse.  In fact, the most obvious reason why tax receipts stopped falling in 2004 is that 2004 is also the year in which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/tax-rates-and-economic-growth-look-at.html">tax rates stopped falling</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the percentage change…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTpq3oXZI/AAAAAAAAAso/EsuTWrMdzaQ/s1600-h/Tax+Receipts+-+Annualized+Growth+in+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvHTpq3oXZI/AAAAAAAAAso/EsuTWrMdzaQ/s320/Tax+Receipts+-+Annualized+Growth+in+Real+Tax+Receipts+per+Capita.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>One doesn’t even need color coding to spot the difference between Dems and Reps.  Now, one might say… well, Reps don’t think collecting more in taxes is a good thing.  There are three problems with this…  the first is that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">in most years in this sample, there was a deficit</a> and in every year of the sample, there was a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">national debt</a>.  Big one, too.  Now, one could discount this if the group collecting taxes – i.e., Republicans – also produced faster growth as a result.  Problem two is that they don’t – in fact, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">economic growth is slower</a> among those that collect less in tax revenue.  And then there’s problem 3 – a number of Republican Presidents (not mention Republican candidates) have promised that cutting taxes would (or, as per the growth above did) lead to faster growth and more taxes being collected.  </p>
<p>And so we come back to GW and others who insist over and over and over that cutting tax rates leads to increased tax collections…  some are liars, some are buffoonishly ignorant about the topic, and some are both.  But every one of them fits into one of these three categories.  I don&#8217;t see any other options.  Do you?</p>
