<p>There are a couple of rightwing rants that are like fingernails across the chalkboard for me.  One is the ongoing claim – even today – that the US labor market is just wonderful because our unemployment rate has stayed near 4.6% for some time.  Never mind the fact that the employment to population ratio has dropped from 63.4% at the end of 2006 to 62.8% as of August 2007.  The other is to claims things just suck in European nations such as Germany.  </p>
<p>As he does so often &#8211; <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=nyt_libels_germany_on_unemploy">Dean Baker</a> provides some wonderful insights on what many brain dead pundits get so very wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also misleads readers on the extent of Germany’s unemployment rate. It reports that the rate has fallen to 9 percent, implying Germany still has very high unemployment. In fact, this is the official German measure of unemployment, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed. The OECD measure for German unemployment (which uses essentially the same methodology as the U.S.) is 6.4 percent.  Since unemployment is still concentrated in the areas that were formerly East Germany, the unemployment rate in the areas that were formerly West Germany would be approximately the same as in the United States.  There is no legitimate reason for using the official German unemployment rate, which is not comparable to the U.S. rate, without explaining the distinction to readers. This is especially inappropriate since the OECD rate is so readily available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean provides <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/Default.aspx?QueryName=251&#038;QueryType=View&#038;Lang=en">this link</a> to the OECD data on standardized unemployment rates (SUR) from which I took our graph as to how the unemployment rate for both Germany and the US rose during the first few years of this decade.  In early 2001, SUR for Germany was 3% higher than it was for the US (that East German thing Dean mentioned).  Over the next year, our SUR grew more than Germany’s but then their SUR did not peak until July 2004 while SUR for the US peaked in June 2003.  The good news for both nations is that the unemployment rate has declined.  For the US, the current unemployment rate is still higher than it was as of January 2001 but for Germany, the unemployment rate as of July 2007 was lower than it was as of January 2001.  </p>
<p>But let’s see what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/world/europe/12merkel.html?ex=1347249600&#038;en=6fc5a2b2eedcde33&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Nicholas Kulish</a> wrote in the NY Times that set Dean off:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mrs. Merkel has also benefited from the resurgence of the German economy, which grew 2.9 percent last year. That is hardly scorching growth for China or India, but for a country that had not grown faster than 1.2 percent in any of the previous five years, it was terrific. Most important to national sentiment here is the ever improving job market. The unemployment rate has dropped to 9 percent, from 12 percent in 2005, the year Mrs. Merkel came to power. Most analysts attribute the jump at least in part to the controversial overhaul of the labor market led by her predecessor Gerhard Schroder &#8230; Some economists worry that the relatively modest labor market changes have fallen far short of what the German economy needs to assure its long-term competitiveness, and that the government might be well advised to use this time of prosperity to tackle the tough issues. Instead, the long-awaited recovery has led to relief and perhaps even a little complacency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our chart does not show that the German unemployment rate ever hit 12% and it indicates that it is far below 9%.  What’s the deal?  Dean explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also misleads readers on the extent of Germany’s unemployment rate. It reports that the rate has fallen to 9 percent, implying Germany still has very high unemployment. In fact, this is the official German measure of unemployment, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed.</p></blockquote>
<p>To compare Germany’s official rate, which counts part-time workers as being unemployed, to the US official rate which does not (OECD’s SUR does not either) is an apples to oranges comparison.  Our graph is an oranges to oranges comparison.  Does Mr. Kulish understand what he writes about?  Or maybe he’s have us do an apples to apples comparison leaving in part-time workers for both nations.  Hmm &#8211; <a href="http://www.bls.gov./webapps/legacy/cpsatab6.htm">this source</a> says there were 25.1 million part-time workers in the US. Wow – that’s 10.8% of the civilian adult population!  Then again, the BLS defines part-time workers as “those who usually work less than 35 hours per week”.  To be honest, I don’t know how the Germans define this.  But maybe that’s why the OECD excludes part-workers from the unemployment statistics.  One would think that reporters and rightwing pundits would know better before comparing official unemployment rates across nations.</p>

                                <p>dmarek suggested <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi72.html">this article</a> about government functions regarding the FDA.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FDA doesn’t disagree with the scientific information about cherries, but it does say that cherries have not been recognized as safe and effective when used as labeled. Do we need a double-blind placebo-controlled study to prove cherries promote health?</p>
<p>Jeffrey May, editor of CCH Trade Regulation Reporter (the &#8220;publication of record&#8221; in the antitrust and trade regulation fields), quotes Rep. Ron Paul as saying there is a need to stop &#8220;federal bureaucrats from preventing Americans from learning about simple ways to improve their health.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answer, even when the FDA had 1000 agents and up to date labs in the 1990&#8217;s, it was way too busy. Now, when global sourcing makes for a lot of proven risk so far, the FDA has 422 agents and out of date labs, whose work is screened by a political appointee from the White House. Ouch!</p>
<p>Also, in another vein some info on treatments for PTSD is related to the issue of best practice and health care.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful, rigourous double blind study by a well known expert in trauma research that suggests YOGA as a form of treatment of choice for many people as opposed to more behavioral (non-motor oriented) therapies. Significant difference ( in the reducing symptoms category), but a 50% dropout rate. Behavioral techniques had significantly lessor results but a 10% dropout rate.</p>
<p>Mental health cannot charge for Yoga lessons however, so the study was published in a non-psych journal after being refused by professional journals. Informed consent suffers, and so do clients who are not offered reasonable alternatives. I believe informed individual consent is a very conservative viewpoint, is it not?</p>
<p>Blue Cross/Blue Shield in MA will not pay for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/reader-dan-on-combat-ptsd-and-us.html">EMDR</a>, a treatment stated as one of the best practice treatments in Britain, the VA, DoD, etc. An odd world we live in.</p>

<blockquote><p>These assaults are part of what may be the best kept secret of the Iraq-Afghanistan conflicts: an enormous intensification of US bombardments in these and other countries in the region, the increasing number of civilian casualties such a strategy entails, and the growing role of pilot-less killers in the conflict.<br />According to <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">Associated Press</a>, there has been a five-fold increase in the number of bombs dropped on Iraq during the first six months of 2007 over the same period in 2006. More than 30 tons of those have been cluster weapons, which take an especially heavy toll on <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070611/turse">civilians</a>.<br />The U.S. Navy has added an <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">aircraft carrier</a> to its Persian Gulf force, and the Air Force has moved <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/071507Y.shtml">F-16s</a> into Balad air base north of Baghdad.<br />Balad, which currently conducts 10,000 air operations a week, is strengthening runways to handle the increase in air activity. Col. David Reynolds told the AP, &#8220;We would like to get to be a field like Langley, if you will.&#8221; The Langley field in Virginia is one of the Air Force&#8217;s biggest and most sophisticated airfields.<br />The Air Force certainly appears to be settling in for a long war. &#8220;Until we can determine that the Iraqis have got their air force to significant capability,&#8221; says Lt Gen. Gary North, the regional air commander, &#8220;I think the coalition will be here to support that effort.&#8221;<br />The Iraqi air force is virtually non-existent. It has no combat aircraft and only a handful of transports.<br />Improving the runways has allowed the Air Force to move B1-B bombers from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to Balad, where the big aircraft have been carrying out daily strikes. A B1-B can carry up to 24 tons of bombs.<br />The step-up in air attacks is partly a reflection of how beaten up and overextended U.S. ground troops are. While Army units put in 15-month tours, Air Force deployments are only four months, with some only half that. And Iraqi and Afghani insurgents have virtually no ability to inflict casualties on aircraft flying at 20,000 feet and using laser and satellite-guided weapons, in contrast to the serious damage they are doing to US ground troops.<br />Besides increasing the number of F-16s, B1-Bs, and A-10 attack planes, Predator flight hours over both countries have doubled from 2005. &#8220;The Predator is coming into its own as a no-kidding weapon verses a reconnaissance-only platform,&#8221; brags Maj. Jon Dagley, commander of the 46th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron.<br />The Air Force is also deploying a bigger, faster and more muscular version of the Predator, the MQ-9 &#8220;Reaper&#8221; — as in grim — a robot capable of carrying four Hellfire missiles, plus two 500 lb. bombs.<br />The Predators and the Reapers have several advantages, the most obvious being they don&#8217;t need pilots. &#8220;With more Reapers I could send manned airplanes home,&#8221; <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3379446">says North</a>.<br />At $8.5 million an aircraft — the smaller Predator comes in at $4.5 million apiece — they are also considerably cheaper than the F-16 ($19 million) the B1-B ($200+ million) and even the A-10 ($9.8 million).<br />The Air Force plans to deploy 170 Predators and 70 Reapers over the next three years. &#8220;It is possible that in our lifetime we will be able to run a war without ever leaving the US,&#8221; Lt Col David Branham told the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&#038;res=9C03EFDF103BF933A15757C0A9659C8B63">New York Times</a>.<br />The result of the stepped up air war, according to the London-based organization <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>, is an increase in civilian casualties. A <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/webfiles/images/journals/lancet/s0140673606694919.pdf">Lancet</a> study of &#8220;excess deaths&#8221; caused by the Iraq war found that air attacks were responsible for 13% of the deaths — 76,000 as of June 2006 — and that 50% of the deaths of children under 15 were caused by air strikes.<br />The number of civilian deaths in Afghanistan from air strikes has created a rift between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States.<br />&#8220;A senior British commander,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B14F6395C0C7A8CDDA10894DF404482">New York Times</a>, has pressed U.S. Special Forces (SF) to leave southern Afghanistan because their use of air power was alienating the local people. SFs work in small teams and are dependent on air power for support. </p></blockquote>
<p>As I have been stating for awhile, the increase in the use of the Air Force is being accelerated. The notion of drones being piloted from Nevada is more disturbing than if they were piloted from the Green Zone or the Air Force base George Bush visited recently. Still, the beat goes on and on.</p>

                                <p>Reader OldVet weighs in about David Petraeus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s the <a href="http://www.hackworth.com/">obituary</a> of a real soldier, quickly forgotten, who put out the straight word on another unpopular war.  He was also the most ferocious and unyielding combatants on our side in that conflict.  He stood head and shoulders above the rest during his time, and I only wish we had military leaders who were fit to shake his hand serving us today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most competent person I ever worked for in the private sector was a corporate Vice President whose first name was Jeff.  Jeff was like Mr. Wolf in Pulp Fiction &#8211; when something went wrong, they called him in to fix it.  (There were a few others like him &#8211; in a big corporation one fix-it person isn&#8217;t enough.  But I think he was the best of the fix-it guys.)</p>
<p>But Jeff never rose to the top ranks &#8211; he never got a seat at the the big boys table.  The reason is simple&#8230; while the top brass knew Jeff was the most competent guy they had (or they wouldn&#8217;t keep using him to solve the messes other people created), he wasn&#8217;t what they were looking for in an executive.  What they wanted in an executive was someone who says definitively:  &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;, even if its wrong.  And Jeff was competent enough to know that the answer is never as simple as Yes or No.  So less competent individuals made it to the top&#8230;  and Jeff cleaned up after them.  </p>
<p>A guy like Hackworth &#8211; who worried about the ordinary grunts and didn&#8217;t see the simple solutions on the battlefield &#8211; well, he&#8217;s not what a President who doesn&#8217;t do nuance wants in a military commander.  And I suspect he&#8217;s not what a President who doesn&#8217;t do nuance got in a military commander.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/is-the-surge-wo.html">Mark Thoma</a>, an <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014427">NBER paper</a> by Michael Greenstone from MIT.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a paucity of facts about the effects of the recent military Surge on conditions in Iraq and whether it is paving the way for a stable Iraq. Selective, anecdotal and incomplete analyses abound. Policy makers and defense planners must decide which measures of success or failure are most important, but until now few, if any, systematic analyses were available on which to base those decisions. This paper applies modern statistical techniques to a new data file derived from more than a dozen of the most reliable and widely-cited sources to assess the Surge&#8217;s impact on three key dimensions: the functioning of the Iraqi state (including civilian casualties); military casualties; and financial markets&#8217; assessment of Iraq&#8217;s future. The new and unusually rigorous findings presented here should help inform current evaluations of the Surge and provide a basis for better decision making about future strategy.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals mixed evidence on the Surge&#8217;s effect on key trends in Iraq. The security situation has improved insofar as civilian fatalities have declined without any concurrent increase in casualties among coalition and Iraqi troops. However, other areas, such as oil production and the number of trained Iraqi Security Forces have shown no improvement or declined. Evaluating such conflicting indicators is challenging.</p>
<p>There is, however, another way to assess the Surge. This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today&#8217;s Iraq surviving into the future. In particular, I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds, which the Iraqi government is currently servicing, on world financial markets. After the Surge, there is a sharp decline in the price of those bonds, relative to alternative bonds. The decline signaled a 40% increase in the market&#8217;s expectation that Iraq will default. This finding suggests that to date the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the folks who talk about the wisdom of the market a lot probably aren&#8217;t going to be all that happy about what the market says in this case.  My own metric that I&#8217;ve brought up a few times&#8230; the number of cheerleaders willing to vacation in Iraq with their families, has been lodged at zero since the invasion.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers know that I&#8217;ve had a series of posts comparing the performance of Presidents on various issues.  One thing that is clear is that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Democratic Presidents have outperformed their Republican counterparts when it comes to Economic Growth</a> over the past fifty something years.  I&#8217;ve tried it explaining it a number of ways, and I&#8217;ve looked at various factors, but while I&#8217;ve been able to show that a number of things aren&#8217;t the cause of this discrepancy, I haven&#8217;t been show what is.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/012069.php">this post by Kevin Drum</a>, it occurs to me that while the difference in performance is something one can measure and put numbers on, the reason for the difference may be less quantifiable.  See, Kevin&#8217;s post links to two stories which have excerpts from Alan Greenspan&#8217;s forthcoming book.</p>
<p>Now, before we go on, I should note&#8230; Uncle Alan served under six Presidents:  Nixon, Ford, Reagan, GHW, Clinton, and GW.  </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFm7L8vuX_ts&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg</a>, </p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were the most intelligent, he wrote, while he found Ford the most normal and likeable. Ronald Reagan was the most devoted to free markets, though his grasp of economics &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very deep or sophisticated.&#8221;</p>
<p>George H.W. Bush, the current president&#8217;s father, was very cordial, though Greenspan&#8217;s relationship with him was complicated by differing views on monetary policy, he wrote. Bush blamed high interest rates, in part, for his 1992 election loss to Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Greenspan saved his harshest analysis for the current president. Soon after Bush took office in 2001, the president set about implementing a campaign promise to cut taxes, a policy Greenspan said he believed at the time wasn&#8217;t well conceived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or the weighing of long-term consequences,&#8221; he wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118978549183327730-lMyQjAxMDE3ODE5NDcxODQ1Wj.html">Wall Street Journal</a> went on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>He describes Bill Clinton as &#8220;a fellow information hound&#8221; with &#8220;a consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth&#8221; whose relationship with Monica Lewinsky &#8220;made me feel disappointed and sad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And lest we forget, this is Uncle Alan we&#8217;re talking about&#8230;  </p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Greenspan, who calls himself a &#8220;lifelong libertarian Republican,&#8221; writes that he advised the White House to veto some bills to curb &#8220;out-of-control&#8221; spending while the Republicans controlled Congress. He says President Bush&#8217;s failure to do so &#8220;was a major mistake.&#8221; Republicans in Congress, he writes, &#8220;swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But we already knew <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/did-alan-greenspan-illegally-manipulate.html">Greenspan was no friend to Bill Clinton</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, among the six Presidents under whom Greenspan has served, one was a Democrat.  That Democrat was the best performer in terms of real GDP per capita growth, and all the more so when you take into account the change in the national debt.  (As discussed in other posts, one should account for changes in debt &#8211; since a component of GDP is government spending, the government could pull a Reagan, and boost GDP simply by borrowing a humongous amount and spending it, leaving a big bill for his successors.)   And that Democrat, not surprisingly, is the only one (according to these excerpts) that Uncle Alan characterized as intelligent and focused on economic growth.  And Nixon, the other President characterized as intelligent, was clearly more boneheaded on the economy &#8211; just think price controls.</p>
<p>What about the Presidents in our sample under whom Uncle Alan did not serve?  Well, those were Ike, JFK/LBJ, and Carter.  Ike&#8217;s reputation was that he was, well, out to golf.  JFK/LBJ, on the other hand, was the administration of technocrats.  Right or wrong, they brought number crunching to the White House, especially to the economy.  And Carter may be, as Homer has noted, &#8220;history&#8217;s greatest monster&#8221;, and a hapless micromanager to boot, but it was generally agreed he was a smart man. </p>
<p>So maybe that&#8217;s the difference&#8230;  Democratic Presidents have tended to be smarter and more focused on the economy.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/listening_to_sunni_arabs.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> we get to <a href="http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=sunni_world">Marc Lynch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s Sunnis must be amazed at the role they are playing in today&#8217;s Washington. A year ago, they were &#8220;dead-enders,&#8221; brutal killers disgruntled over their expulsion from power and nostalgic for the return of Saddam Hussein. The suggestion that Americans might productively talk to Sunni insurgents would have met with as much Beltway scorn as do calls today to engage in talks with Iran or Syria.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with these Sunni throwbacks, we were told back then, was to unleash American firepower and pummel them until they surrendered or died. America&#8217;s failures were failures of timidity and political correctness. Arabs only understood force, and America needed to beat them into submission and forget about &#8220;struggling to win hearts and minds which can&#8217;t be won.&#8221; The rubble of Fallujah and the prisons of Abu Ghraib bear silent testimony to the influence of such thinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Alas, while the president&#8217;s men may have discovered Iraq&#8217;s Sunnis, they still show little sign of actually understanding them. The cheerleaders for the surge have constructed a Disney-esque fantasy of an Iraqi &#8220;Sunni World&#8221; which might as well be in Orlando for all it has to do with the grim realities of today&#8217;s Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Much of the conventional wisdom about the Sunni areas now seems to come from the impressions formed by politicians and journalists on stage-managed visits to Iraq, or by carefully crafted press interviews with &#8220;former insurgents&#8221; hand-picked by American military handlers. But we don&#8217;t need such a mediated view. Leaders of the major Iraqi Sunni groups actually speak quite often and quite candidly to their own people, though: in open letters, in official statements posted on internet forums, in the Arab and Iraqi press, and in statements released on al-Jazeera and other satellite television stations. What they say in such statements, in Arabic, when addressing their own constituencies, might be considered a more reliable guide to their strategy and thinking. So what are the major Iraqi Sunni leaders saying?</p>
<p>In their literature and public rhetoric, the Sunni insurgency has already defeated the American occupation &#8212; which is why the Americans stopped fighting them and came to them for help in fighting al-Qaeda. One discovers virtually nothing in this literature of the American conceit that our forces wore them out or forced them to come to the table. During his meeting with President Bush in Anbar last week, Abu Risha, reportedly joked that his people had achieved in four months what the American military could not achieve in four years. It was one of the few claims made by Abu Risha with which most Iraqi Sunnis would agree, and one which should probably have infuriated more Americans than it seems to have.</p>
<p>Most of these statements are already looking past the question of al-Qaeda, and are instead in preparation for the aftermath of an American withdrawal. The overwhelming theme of recent Sunni discourse is the need to achieve political unity to prepare for a post-occupation Iraq. While Americans celebrate their cordial relations with certain tribal shaykhs, the insurgency&#8217;s leaders publicly fumed that the fruits of their victory might be snatched by undeserving interlopers. The widely disseminated pictures of President Bush shaking hands with Sattar Abu Risha, the epitome of such illegitimate bon vivantes, were likely his death warrant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, certain tribes worry that the groundwork is being laid for the domination of Sunni politics by other tribes, and that this is in fact the American plan &#8212; to leave behind a divided, suspicious, and compromised array of tribes which will be unable to act politically. An important recent open letter from the highly influential Association of Muslim Scholars powerfully invoked the experience of the Afghan jihad, which collapsed upon itself after defeating the Soviet Union. The famously fractious insurgency has been trying hard to put forward a public political front to fill this perceived void, though at this point the various projects still seem to exist mostly on paper.</p>
<p>Partition, soft or hard, has far fewer fans in Anbar than in Washington. Most Sunnis continue to support a unified Iraqi state, and have exaggerated expectations about the role they should play in such a state. A recent letter from the &#8220;Amir&#8221; of the Islamic Army of Iraq claimed that Sunnis made up 60 percent of the population of Iraq, and few Sunnis seem ready to accept the status of &#8220;tolerated minority&#8221; within a Shia-dominated state. The Maliki government is almost universally denounced as sectarian, culpable for sectarian cleansing, and an Iranian puppet.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing in current Sunni discourse to suggest that any sort of &#8220;bottom up reconciliation&#8221; with the Shia is taking place or that the tactical cooperation with American forces against al-Qaeda is producing any kind of meaningful integration into the Iraqi state. Far more common is the need to prepare for future conflict with the Shia and, increasingly, the Kurds (see Kirkuk and Mosul). Resentment over the sectarian &#8216;cleansing&#8217; of Baghdad runs exceptionally high, and few Sunnis seem prepared to accept any political settlement which does not include their return to Baghdad &#8212; something that the Shia militias (which continue to dominate the Iraqi Police) seem rather unlikely to accept.</p>
<p>Finally, the alliance of convenience with American forces has not translated into support for the United States at the mass level. A public opinion survey conducted last month &#8212; well into the surge &#8212; found that only 1 percent of Sunnis say they have confidence in American forces and only 1 percent of Sunnis support the American presence in Iraq. Rather, 72 percent of Sunnis say that the US forces should leave immediately, 95 percent say that the presence of U.S. troops makes security worse, and 93 percent still see attacks on coalition forces as acceptable. Such results should make obvious the vacuity of claims that the turn against al-Qaeda was a victory for American diplomacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve stated before, the big difference I can see between Iraq and Vietnam is that in Vietnam, our allies wouldn&#8217;t happily shoot at Americans if given the opportunity.  Fortunately, if we just clap harder the problem goes away.</p>

<blockquote><p>ADM&#8217;s finagling in Washington may have cost taxpayers and consumers more than $40 billion since 1980, counting the cost of the sugar program ($3 billion in higher prices each year), the ethanol program, and federal food giveaways and export subsidies. Some of those dubious programs probably would have been enacted even if Andreas had not been foisting cash on every politician in sight, but ADM deserves credit for being a decisive force in enacting and perpetuating many of the federal government&#8217;s most abusive policies.<br />ADM&#8217;s political strategy has long been based on the ideas that politicians should control prices and markets and that ADM and Andreas should control politicians. Some commentators may conclude that the ADM experience proves the need for campaign finance reform, but that would be the triumph of hope over experience. Campaign finance laws have been repeatedly revised in recent decades, yet politics does not smell any better.(137) As long as the politicians are shoveling out billions of dollars in handouts, some citizens will find a way to reward politicians for &#8220;looking after their interests.&#8221;<br />Besides, at a time when Congress is rightfully moving toward removing millions of able-bodied citizens from welfare rolls, there is no excuse to perpetuate handouts for a company like ADM. If a company can afford endless advertisements on national television, it is safe to conclude that it does not need any help from American taxpayers.<br />The Supreme Court, in Savings and Loan Association v. Topeka (1875), stated, &#8220;To lay with one hand the power of the government on the property of the citizen and with the other to bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes is none the less a robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation.&#8221;(138) Andreas apparently can buy politicians, but that does not mean that ADM has a right to shake down American consumers and taxpayers.<br />Congress, in the pending farm bill and in legislation to extend the ethanol gasoline fuel tax credit, has an excellent chance to shut down the ADM gravy train. Congress&#8217;s action on the ADM agenda will be an appropriate litmus test of the new Republican leadership&#8217;s spine. If Congress cannot stand up to ADM, how can they be expected to stand up for American taxpayers and consumers in other, less egregious cases?</p>

<p>Even the WTO GATS pressure will not move this mountain very soon. How do we know who captured whom? And is that a sane way to think?  And the Dems passed the Agricultural Bill 2007.</p>

<blockquote><p>For more than four years since the invasion of Iraq, President Bush most often has defined his objective there with a single, stirring word: &#8220;Victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Victory in Iraq is vital for the United States of America,&#8221; he told cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in May. &#8220;Victory in this struggle will require more patience, more courage and more sacrifice,&#8221; he warned National Guardsmen in West Virginia in July.</p>
<p>But this week, the word &#8220;victory&#8221; disappeared from the president&#8217;s lexicon. It was replaced by a slightly more ambiguous goal: &#8220;Success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The success of a free Iraq is critical to the security of the United States,&#8221; Bush said Thursday evening in his brief televised address from the Oval Office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq, we can begin seeing troops come home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s description of his war aims reflected two hard realities about his position on Iraq.</p>
<p>First, a large majority of the American public does not believe &#8220;victory&#8221; is possible. Dozens of opinion polls have found that fewer than 40% of voters think the war can be won.</p>
<p>Second, the men who are running the war &#8212; Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker &#8212; made it clear this week that their immediate goals were more limited than &#8220;victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where the United States once hoped for a peaceful, united Iraq governed by a Western-style parliament, Petraeus and Crocker described more modest goals: reducing sectarian violence, avoiding all-out civil war and encouraging self-rule with a strong role for tribal sheiks who are not elected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot guarantee success in Iraq,&#8221; Crocker said in hearings before Congress. &#8220;The challenges. . . are immense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Petraeus shied away from even using the word &#8220;success.&#8221; When a senator asked whether the United States had &#8220;a realistic chance to be successful&#8221; in Iraq, the general carefully replied: &#8220;I believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our objectives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Four years and change out, the purpose of staying in Iraq has become to try to reduce the level of violence resulting from the invasion of Iraq.</p>
