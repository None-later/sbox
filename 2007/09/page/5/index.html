                                <p>Update II: Thanks to Dean, Bill Polley, and K Harris.  I knew there was an unscheduled meeting on 4/18/2001 where the FED cut interest rates by 0.5% but it  turns out that the 1/31/2001 meeting where they did the same was also unscheduled.  It would seem that the FED in 2001 was acting proactively to shore up aggregate demand.  </p>

<p>It is a very rare day that <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=fed_cuts_rates_by_half_point_a">Dean Baker</a> makes a mistake but we have him on a minor one:</p>
<blockquote><p>The coverage of the Fed&#8217;s half point cut in interest rates yesterday highlighted the enthusiastic response of the markets. According to much of the coverage, the markets soared yesterday because they are now confident that Bernanke will move aggressively to try to counteract a recession. A bit of history would have been useful to include in this context. As some articles noted, this cut bears a resemblance to the Fed&#8217;s 0.5 percentage point cut in January of 2001 at an unscheduled emergency meeting. That cut also led to a very enthusiastic response from Wall Street. The Dow rose 2.8 percent following that cut and the Nasdaq jumped by a record 14.2 percent. In reporting on the significance of the cut, the NYT quoted Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch: &#8220;there&#8217;s a simple message, the Fed will do whatever it takes to keep the U.S. economy from going down the tubes.&#8221;  Mr. Steinberg may have been right about the Fed&#8217;s intentions. It did continue to cut interest rates, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 5.5 percentage points to 1.0 percent, the lowest rate since the mid-fifties. However, this rate cutting did not prevent the economy from falling into a recession. It began to lose jobs just a month after the January rate cut. In spite of the Fed&#8217;s aggressive rate cutting, the economy remained so weak that it took four full years to once again reach the employment levels of February 2001.  The lesson from the 2001 experience is that cutting interest rates is not necessarily a very effective tool in counteracting the impact of a collapsing asset bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean’s larger point is right so you may have missed the minor point.  Fortunately, we have an April 18, 2001 by <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,23789,00.html">Anya Schiffrin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stock investors are cheering the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to cut interest rates at a surprise meeting Wednesday, but it doesn&#8217;t appear that Alan Greenspan &#038; Co. were talking to them. The Fed, which slashed the federal funds rate to a seven-year low of 4.5% from 5%, and the discount rate to 4% from 4.5%, seems to have been intent on spurring investment by U.S. companies. Getting companies to continue spending is key if the economy is to grow, and the Fed said in its statement that it is worried that capital investment has &#8220;continued to soften.&#8221; This softening, combined with slow growth overseas and the effect of layoffs and the declining stock market on consumer spending &#8220;threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Dean’s larger point is borne out even if he had the date of this surprise 0.5 percent decline off by a few months.  Back then – as is the case now – the fear is that the IS curve has shifted inwards.  Lower interest rates are supposed to move us along the IS curve back to full employment but if the inward shift of the IS curve is large enough and if the interest elasticity of the IS curve is small enough, aggregate demand might still decline. </p>
<p>Now you might ask – wouldn’t a large decline in interest rates still reverse the decline in aggregate demand?  Maybe but check out our graph of the Federal funds rate from early 2001 to late 2004.  The FED did massively lower interest rates and we did eventually see a reversal of weak aggregate demand.  But as we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/anatomy-of-recovery-delong-smack-down.html">here</a>, John Cassidy’s claim that we had a robust recovery in 2002 is flat wrong.  I wonder if <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/09/kpcc-radio-fede.html">Brad DeLong</a> got this across to Mr. Cassidy when they appeared on Larry Mantle’s radio show?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On January 31, 2001, the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2001/20010131">FED met</a> and cut the target rate from 6 percent to 5.5 percent and expressed confidence that we would avoid a recession:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time. Nonetheless, the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FED statement after that surprise decision on April 18, 2001 can be found <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2001/20010418">here</a> and its tone was less optimistic than the tone back on January 31, 2001.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post_group/ObamaHQ/CWrm">Obama ‘08</a> calls his new proposal “tax fairness”.  It does have a few tax cuts for the average Joe, but <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/012095.php">Kevin Drum</a> is not exactly impressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know that it&#8217;s unfair to expect Obama to live up to his own hype every day. Not every proposal from his campaign is really going to be bold and innovative, even if he says it is. But really, if he&#8217;s planning to campaign as the guy with fresh ideas, he&#8217;s going to have to do better than this.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see the Republicans topping the modest tax cuts that Senator Obama is proposing by promsing larger tax cuts for everyone.  But that’s the problem.  The GOP is all about Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow, which simply means deferring the tax bite.  I don’t want Democrats promising voters that money grows on trees.  So I read down to see where Senator Obama might try to actually increase tax revenues and found this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama would pay for his tax reform plan by closing corporate loopholes, cracking down on international tax havens, closing the carried interest loophole, and increasing the dividends and capital gains rate for the top bracket.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope he means it and he finds a way that we can better enforce the current tax laws – including enforcement of section 482.  The current Administration doesn’t seem so interested in insuring that U.S. based multinationals don’t shift income to the tax havens.  So good for the Senator for proposing the obvious.  But let’s not get too carried away as to how easy this will be or how much in revenues this will raise.</p>

                                <p>Some problems are intractable; they simply must play themselves to the bitter end.  In today’s New York Times, I see two:</p>
<p>The first lays out the problems for Iraqi partition; the second comments on the latest Fed move, cutting interest rates by 50 bps.</p>
<p>The Iraq disaster, which we own and must acknowledge, has no easy fix.  Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Iraqi’s are displaced, impoverished, killed or wounded. The U.S. worries about its dead and wounded, or the financial burden of the war.  Our losses pale before Iraqi<a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/"> losses</a>.  Total U.S. and UK casualties are under 5000.</p>
<p>As of March, 2005, <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/IraqiDeaths.aspx">&#8220;official&#8221;</a> count of Iraqi civilian casualties is 37,551.  Remember the war begin in March, 2003. Officially, we have no count for two years.</p>
<p>There are many places to go to make the comparison.  Whatever numbers you choose, Iraqi’s have suffered enormously compared to coalition forces.  And we have not begun to measure Iraqi refugees, which certainly exceed a million or more. Nor have we begun to begun to measure the financial cost to Iraq.  </p>
<p>The immorality and stupidity of the invasion remain intractable no matter what we do now: Leave or surge.  Perhaps an apology and jail time should be required of those who led us into the war.  That alone might help.</p>
<p>The second problem is, of course, the sub prime carnage, which is indicative of a deeper issue: Living well beyond our means.  After 2001, the Fed lowered interest rates.  Meanwhile, industry after industry fled abroad to make easier bucks through labor, tax, and environmental arbitrage.  Easy credit allowed not only the housing boom but allowed consumers to use MEW (mortgage equity withdrawal) and easy credit in general to spend at an accelerated pace, even as our trade balance fell and our debt, personal and public, rose.  We primed the pump; we really primed the pump.  Priming did not improve our investment at home; it had no bearing on our trade deficit—and it should have had.</p>
<p>Now, once again, the Fed is coming to the rescue with easier credit; &#8220;Prime it again,&#8221; Sam.  Bills have to be paid; the piper will have his due, now or later.  And he charges interest.  One way or another, this problem will play itself through to the bitter end.  </p>
<p>Behind these two problems, lies two more, far more intractable: Energy and Global Warming.</p>
<p>Oil is becoming more expensive in real terms even as the dollar weakens.  The weakening dollar only exacerbates the cost of oil, which is inflationary, of course.  (The Fed is between a rock and a hard place on this one. Ease up the credit to alleviate the credit crunch; meanwhile, the cost of energy will be inflationary.)  Like it or not, we are approaching peak oil; use whatever definition you want for this one. It is a limited resource.  I prefer thinking of it this way: Demand approaches the capacity of the spigot.</p>
<p>Global Warming and all its associated ills?  You all have heard enough from me on this one.  Global warming is not yet at our front door, nor will it be for a couple of years.  But when it comes, we will rue the day we were so cavalier at its approach.</p>

                                <p>We have been discussing a lot of economics through the political viewer lately. And I certainly have laid my point of view out there, but I also like the theory discussion. I like to think and know how stuff works or how someone interprets what they see. I believe discussing theories leads to better political discussion. With that, I hope this might inspire some tangent topics into the political here at AB.</p>
<p>This is a paper out of France by <a href="http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf">Robert U Ayres &#038; Benjamin Warr </a>titled: Accounting for Growth: The role of physical work</p>
<p>They suggest the increasing extraction of work from energy do to the increasing development of energy use is the missing factor that explains our growth.<br />
<blockquote>“However the major result of the paper is that it is not `raw’ energy (exergy) as an input, but exergy converted to useful (physical) work that – along with capital and(human)labor – really explains output and drives long-term economic growth.” “However, if we replace raw energy as an input by `useful work’ (the sum total of all types of physical work by animals, prime movers and heat transfer systems) as a factor of production, the historical growth path of the US is reproduced with high accuracy from 1900 until the mid 1970s, without any residual except during brief periods of economic dislocation, and with fairly high accuracy since then.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There key concept is the definition of exergy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The formal definition of exergy is the maximum work that could theoretically be done by a system as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings, reversibly. Thus exergy is effectively equivalent to potential work. There is an important distinction between potential work and actual work done by animals or machines. The conversion efficiency between exergy (potential work), as an input, and actual work done, as an output, is also an important concept in thermodynamics. The notion of thermodynamic efficiency plays a key role in this paper.<br />To summarize: the technical definition of exergy is the maximum work that a subsystem can do as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium (reversibly) with its surroundings.” </p></blockquote>
<p>This summarizes their theories development:</p>
<blockquote><p>The supposed link between factor payments and factor productivities gives the national accounts a direct and fundamental (but spurious) role in production theory. In reality, however, (as noted in the introduction) the economy produces final products from a chain of intermediates, not directly from raw materials or, still less, from labor and capital without material inputs. In the simple single sector model used to `prove’ the relationship between factor productivity and factor payments, this crucial fact is neglected. Allowing for the omission of intermediates (by introducing even a two-sector or three-sector production process) the picture changes completely. In effect, downstream value-added stages act as productivity multipliers. This enables a factor receiving a very small share of the national income directly, to contribute a much larger effective share of the value of aggregate production, i.e. to be much more productive than its share of overall labor and capital would seem to imply if the simple theory of income allocation were applicable [Ayres 2001a].</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, then we have a bigger problem concerning how to keep this boat floating than subprime lending and fed rates. We have a policy problem. And that speaks to all the work Cactus has done about presidents.</p>
<p>Related to Cactus&#8217; work, this chart from the this paper is interesting. It is the unexplained portion of growth by their theory.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RvFd-TN21tI/AAAAAAAAAEE/6Xmt5OvRtiQ/s1600-h/Accounting+for+Growth+Chart+1.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RvFd-TN21tI/AAAAAAAAAEE/6Xmt5OvRtiQ/s320/Accounting+for+Growth+Chart+1.JPG" border="0"></a>
<div>Note that this phenomenon begins right about where we see the lowest point of the top 1% share of income, just after we see the split of productivity from wages and the beginnings of the supplyside policies and a change to a net debtor nation. The authors suggest some of this is do to conservation.</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“We conjecture that a kind of phase-change or structural shift took place at that time, triggered perhaps by the so-called energy crisis, precipitated by the OPEC blockade. Higher energy prices induced significant investments in energy conservation and systems optimization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>They further refine the explanation with:</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“The marginal productivity of capital has started to increase whereas the marginal productivity of physical work – resulting from increases in the efficiency of energy conversion – has declined slightly.”</p></blockquote>
<div>Could this marginal capital productivity increase be a result of our policy focus on capital as the driver of growth? Money from money? Are we seeing in their explanation that part of our growth that is borrowed from our future, thus artificially created? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I read this paper it made me think about the European economies who have been focusing on alternative energy development, wind in Denmark, solar in Germany, (Japan), wave generation in England and northern parts, geothermal in Iceland/Greenland. This paper to me suggests that this coming election has at the core of all our topical issues (health care, war, inflation) energy. As the authors conclude keeping in mind peak production issues and the declining output of Saudi&#8217;s fields: </div>
<div>
<blockquote>“From a long-term sustainability viewpoint, this conclusion carries a powerful implication. If economic growth is to continue without proportional increases in fossil fuel consumption, it is vitally important to exploit new ways of generating value added without doing more work. But it is also essential to develop ways of reducing fossil fuel exergy inputs per unit of physical work output (i.e. increasing conversion efficiency). In other words, energy (exergy) conservation is probably the main key to long term environmental sustainability.”</p></blockquote>

<p>[note from cactus &#8211; apologies for the delay in posting this which makes the timing off, I&#8217;ve been traveling]</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>For some time aficionados of financial markets have been jabbering about “Black Swans” and “triggering events” and things like that in order to try and predict what’s going to be the ultimate result of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US .  Risky US mortgages were packaged and sold around the world as “mortgage backed securities.”  A major German bank has had to be rescued after buying this crap, and 157 US mortgage lending intuitions have failed as home buyers failed to pay their debts on time.  In the course of investigating different sources of information and opinion, we note this morning that the Bank of England is declaring some very broad and very public guarantees to depositors of Northern Rock savings and loan society in England, where they’ve had crowds lining up to pull out their deposits.  We also note this morning that the Russian stock market has fallen 10% in the last month or so, largely on foreign investors withdrawing their money. </p>
<p>Likewise we’ve been thinking that a crisis in one mortgage and real estate market like the US may not be isolated, because the housing “bubble” in prices is universal and not local to the US .  Ireland, Spain, China, and India for example, have all seen pure price inflation of housing much greater than in the US .  Does that mean they have pockets of rot in their lending institutions?  Are their mortgage markets and credit practices prudent?   Are they also, like the US , vulnerable to major corrections in housing prices with real economic effects to follow?  Based on the UK experience, outlined in gory detail below, we know there are pockets of rot.  Maybe not in every single market, but in enough to have follow-on consequences in world stock and currency markets.</p>
<p>In this light, and with a major US Federal Reserve Board meeting likely to cut US interest rates a bit this afternoon, we wonder just how much good a rate cut or two will do at this stage of the game?  Are such cuts trivial in a global sense?  After all, it’s not “liquidity” in the banking sectors of the world that are the problem, but risky loans made to poor credit risk home buyers and businesses.  If you can’t pay a million bucks for a house, it won’t matter what the interest rate is or is not, will it? </p>

<blockquote><p>Imagine this situation: You have a friend who spends money like it is going out of fashion. All he does is buy things or invests them in crazy schemes. But in order to fund his spendthrift ways he needs to borrow money from his family and from friends like you.</p>
<p>One day your friend comes up to you. He is in a parlous state. He has lost all his money on failed investments. He owes so much money that some of his belongings have been repossessed already.</p>
<p>You shake your head at his story but you can&#8217;t help but feel as though your friend is entirely to blame for his situation. You knew the warning signs were there and you&#8217;re miffed at the fact that the ten thousand dollars he owes you may never come back.</p>
<p>You also know what he should do. He should cut his spending and live more frugally. He should divert most if not all of his remaining income into paying off his debt. You know that this process will be hard for him, but before you can say anything he asks you: &#8220;So, are you going to lend me money to cover my costs? Come on man!&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>My title is the title of a WSJ op-ed from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119015632031431685.html?mod=rss_whats_news_us">Henry Pulizzi</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saying he &#8220;respectfully&#8221; disagrees with former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan&#8217;s recent criticism, President Bush defended his administration&#8217;s fiscal record and said his tax cuts helped the U.S. fend off recession and reduce massive deficits. &#8220;Our fiscal record is admirable and good. After all, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is low relative to the 30-year average,&#8221; Mr. Bush said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.    I would also argue that cutting taxes &#8230; made a significant difference in dealing with the deficit because the growing economy yielded more tax revenues, which allowed us to shrink the deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>My apologies to AB readers for repeating Mr. Pulizzi’s title as it is complete and utter BS.  Bush did not rebut anything.  Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/uh-no-your-tax-.html">Mark Thoma</a> for reminding us that real economists – which excludes Lawrence Kudlow but does include Bush’s “own economists” &#8211; do not believe in the free lunch supply-side crap that certain GOP politicians routinely utter.  Henry Pullizi should be ashamed of himself for suggesting that George W. Bush rebutted in any way what Alan Greenspan has recently said. </p>
<p>I have a question for the either incredibly stupid or dishonest Henry Pullizi – shouldn’t the fact that Bush went on Faux News been a big clue that his statements were just stupid partisan garbage?  Seriously – how dumb is this Mr. Pullizi?</p>

<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/09/rate-cut-reactions.html">CalculatedRisk</a> highlights a couple of the reactions from the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/09/18/economists-react-one-and-done">WSJ crowd</a>  including this from Peter Schiff: </p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s irresponsible 50 basis point reduction is really just the hair of the dog that bit us and is a tacit admission that our economy is addicted to cheap money… A Fed bailout in the form of rate cuts will neither prevent the recession nor keep house prices from collapsing. It may slow the process down a few quarters, but it will cost us dearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh dear, Mr Schiff sounds a lot like AB reader Don Marek.  My view is a lot closer to that of Martin Feldstein.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>It&#8217;s a dilemma familiar to counterinsurgency strategists: much of the fighting in Ramadi and other places continues because of the American presence, not in spite of it. U.S. commanders tasked with clearing Ramadi, the latest insurgent hub in Anbar Province, aren&#8217;t looking to assault the city with U.S. troops. They want local security forces instead to retake the city gradually. And in recent months a group of tribal leaders in Anbar Province has been working with U.S. forces in that effort, forming a coalition of sheiks who have sent hundreds of their followers to join the Ramadi police force as well as the Iraqi army.<br />The Ramadi strategy, which in essence replaces U.S. troops with Iraqis even as the fight unfolds, shows some early signs of success. Despite bursts of fighting in Ramadi almost daily, schools are opening, and Iraqi police are circulating on their own in neighborhoods that were previously no-go areas. The end game is far from certain in Ramadi and other violent towns in Anbar Province like Hit and Haditha. But the plan already in motion there now means any additional combat troops President Bush may order to Iraq would be better put to use in Baghdad, which everyone agrees must be stabilized for anything else to work in Iraq.</p>
<p>When U.S. strategy in Iraq called for pulling American forces back to large, heavily protected bases last year,<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070501/1a_bottomstrip01.art.htm">Army Col. Sean MacFarland</a>was moving in the opposite direction. He built small, more vulnerable combat outposts in Ramadi&#8217;s most dangerous neighborhoods — places where al-Qaeda had taken root.<br />&#8220;I was going the wrong way down a one-way street,&#8221; MacFarland says.<br />Soon after, MacFarland started negotiating with a group of Sunni sheiks, some of whom have had mixed loyalties in the war. His superiors initially were wary, fearful the plan could backfire, he says. He forged ahead anyway.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s breakthrough came when <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-sadr12sep12,1,777405.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Lt. Col. Patrick Frank</a>, responsible for west Baghdad&#8217;s dangerous Bayaa, Jihad and Amal neighborhoods, met Sept. 3 with tribal leaders belonging to the Mahdi Army at Camp Falcon, a sprawling U.S. base.To preserve the movement&#8217;s posture of not negotiating with Americans, the tribal leaders did not discuss their affiliation, but their identity was well known. &#8220;The organization we are extending our hand to is the Jaish al Mahdi,&#8221; Frank said, using the group&#8217;s Arabic name. A Sadr follower in west Baghdad confirmed that Shiite and Sunni tribal leaders were in negotiations with the Americans for a truce in the area.</p></blockquote>
<p>MacFarland was bucking Odierno I believe, which would not have been pretty. Too bad MacFarland was not testifying about his plan instead of Patraeus representing him.</p>
<p>These are examples of the backbone of the army at the Captain, Lt. Col., and Col. level, where retention is severely declining. Smart people given an impossible task.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve cut the target on a key short-term interest rate by a half of a percentage point Tuesday to 4.75%, further acknowledgment from the central bank that the mortgage meltdown plaguing Wall Street and Main Street could have a negative impact on the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem – according to <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo/Finance</a> that Wall Street is happy:</p>
<blockquote><p>A jubilant Wall Street barreled higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate a larger-than-expected half a percentage point. The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 200 points shortly after the Fed announced its move.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s just hope that will translate into some good news for Main Street with a reversal of the recent decline in the employment to population ratio.</p>
