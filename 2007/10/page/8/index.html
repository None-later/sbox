                                <p>What&#8217;s up with Norton Anti-Virus?  I&#8217;ve been using it for ten years or so, and installed it on my mom&#8217;s computer, but I&#8217;ve since it removed from all of my computers and from my mom&#8217;s computer.  It was really slowing everything down (after one update, the time it took to boot up my computer in the morning went from a couple minutes to fifteen on my main machine, twenty on my mom&#8217;s machine), and starting to conflict with other software.   Including the e-mail software.</p>
<p>I was slowly going nuts&#8230;  and finally I narrowed down the problem to Norton Anti-virus.  After removing Norton and installing CA&#8217;s product, the problems I was noticing went away.   From what I can tell, all of them.  Not just on my machine &#8211; my mom hasn&#8217;t had to call me for help since then either.  I&#8217;ve talked to a few folks who make a living working on other people&#8217;s computers, and when it comes to anti-virus software, I&#8217;ve literally been told:  &#8220;Use anything but Norton.&#8221;  And given the few months of frustration I had, at least for a long time, that&#8217;s advice I will follow.  </p>
<p>What happened?  Norton used to be the gold standard.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/books/review/Kennedy-t.html?_r=1&#038;ref=review&#038;oref=slogin">NY Times</a> review of <em>The Conscience of a Liberal</em> starts off with a brief resume of its author – Paul Krugman.  </p>
<p>This is followed by a really stupid statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>And yet maybe Krugman is not really an economist &#8211; at least not according to the definition offered more than a century ago by Francis Amasa Walker, the first president of the American Economic Association, who wrote that laissez-faire “was not made the test of economic orthodoxy, merely. It was used to decide whether a man were an economist at all.” Most modern economists continue to celebrate Walker’s orthodoxy, and behind it, the classical doctrines of Adam Smith, whose fabled “invisible hand” regularly works wonders of production, distribution, innovation and efficiency, provided it is kept free of the meddlesome “nanny state.” Against the constant threat of encroachment from that benighted quarter the free-market faithful are ever vigilant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who is Mr. Kennedy thinking of when he says “most modern economist”?  The know-nothing nitwits over at the National Review?  They religiously believe in laissez faire.  This is followed by attacks not only on the book but also the author.  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/continuing-the-tradition">Paul</a> calmly rebuts by noting the facts that Mr. Kennedy just skips.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/review-of-the-c.html">Mark Thoma</a> provides a longer rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you start, as David Kennedy does, with the premise that &#8220;maybe Krugman is not really an economist&#8221; because he believes that sometimes government intervention is necessary to correct market failures, you have to wonder if it&#8217;s worth reading on. It&#8217;s not &#8220;anti-economist&#8221; as Kennedy suggests to believe markets sometimes need to be corrected. The suggestion that it is &#8220;anti-economist&#8221; displays the reviewer&#8217;s ignorance about basic economics. Also, if you are going to have an historian rather than an economist or political scientist review Paul Krugman&#8217;s work, it ought to be one who at least gets history right &#8230; More to the point, where&#8217;s a decent reviewer when we need him? As Krugman notes in his response, David Kennedy is wrong about the history of prohibition, and the other &#8220;error&#8221; is a pretty trivial slip of writing 1964 instead of 1965. If those are the best examples of Krugman&#8217;s errors Kennedy (as an historian himself) can come up with, then you have to conclude that Krugman is on pretty solid ground with the historical story he tells. The review also ignores a lot of evidence from political scientist Larry Bartels on values voting that supports Krugman&#8217;s position on the influence of racial politics. The values voting conclusions aren&#8217;t things Krugman simply asserts &#8211; as you might conclude from the review &#8211; Krugman reviews solid evidence before coming to this conclusion. So when Kennedy launches into other reasons why voters may have supported Republicans, it does nothing to undermine Krugman&#8217;s thesis that a large amount of the change arises from racial politics. The Bartels evidence is still there, nothing is presented in the review to counter it, and it paints a clear picture.The author also takes issue with the statement that “Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy,” but once again he does not tell us about nor bother to try to rebut the careful, detailed discussion of right-wing institutions and their common funding sources that comes before this statement. Krugman&#8217;s statement is a summary of this evidence, and to focus on the summary statement rather than than the evidence that supports it is not much of a rebuttal. It&#8217;s too bad that Kennedy chose to argue that, in essence, &#8220;Democrats have problems too&#8221; &#8211; as though that somehow excuses Republicans for issues like racial politics &#8211; rather than dealing with the evidence Krugman presents concerning the political and economic changes that produced the New Gilded Age.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the NY Times should ask someone qualified to write a real review of this book.  In the meantime, maybe Mr. Kennedy should apologize to the readers of the NY Times for such a worthless rant.</p>

                                <p>For the past two decades metro Atlanta has grown in a wild, crazy, largely unplanned and largely unregulated frenzy.</p>
<p>Many business owners and workers prefer the lack of a significant winter and the lower taxes. Yahoo!</p>
<p>No one, apparently, thought about the long term or the lack of infrastructure much, as those topics don&#8217;t win elections, and low taxes are always good, right?</p>
<p>Well, with no additional water storage capacity, Atlanta metro may be the first metro area in American history to run out of water.</p>
<p>Florida, Georgia and Alabama are fighting over various water sources and uses, and all of them want the federal government to &#8220;do something.&#8221; What exactly the federal government can &#8220;do&#8221; is a mystery, beyond possibly reshuffling what water is still there.</p>
<p>No to rub it in, but if I were to set a drill rig on my back lawn and drill for two hours I would likely hit an aquifer with almost infinite water, and I live in the drier part of our area.</p>
<p>Businesses are welcome in the rustbelt, where we have almost limitless water for use (not for pumping to other parts of the country though).  Housing is cheap right now, but there will be a winter, there always is.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; Congress passed a law, triggering a little-noticed worldwide war on human trafficking that began at the end of the Clinton administration and is now a top Bush administration priority. As part of the fight, <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+W.+Bush?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+W.+Bush?tid=informline" target="">President Bush</a> has blanketed the nation with 42 <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Department+of+Justice?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Department+of+Justice?tid=informline" target="">Justice Department</a> task forces and spent more than $150 million &#8212; all to find and help the estimated hundreds of thousands of victims of forced prostitution or labor in the United States.<br />But the government couldn&#8217;t find them. Not in this country.<br />&#8230;<br />The administration has identified 1,362 victims of human trafficking brought into the United States since 2000, nowhere near the 50,000 a year the government had estimated. In addition, 148 federal cases have been brought nationwide, some by the Justice task forces, which are composed of prosecutors, agents from the <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Federal+Bureau+of+Investigation?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Federal+Bureau+of+Investigation?tid=informline" target="">FBI</a> and <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Bureau+of+Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Bureau+of+Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement?tid=informline" target="">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>, and local law enforcement officials in areas thought to be hubs of trafficking.<br />&#8230;<br />&#8220;The discrepancy between the alleged number of victims per year and the number of cases they&#8217;ve been able to make is so huge that it&#8217;s got to raise major questions,&#8221; Weitzer said. &#8220;It suggests that this problem is being blown way out of proportion.&#8221; The <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Department+of+Health+and+Human+Services?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Department+of+Health+and+Human+Services?tid=informline" target="">Department of Health and Human Services</a> &#8220;certifies&#8221; trafficking victims in the United States after verifying that they were subjected to forced sex or labor. Only non-U.S. citizens brought into this country by traffickers are eligible to be certified, entitling them to receive U.S. government benefits.<br />&#8230;<br />Although there have been several estimates over the years, the number that helped fuel the congressional response &#8212; 50,000 victims a year &#8212; was an unscientific estimate by a <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Central+Intelligence+Agency?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Central+Intelligence+Agency?tid=informline" target="">CIA</a> analyst who relied mainly on clippings from foreign newspapers&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />Yet the government spent $28.5 million in 2006 to fight human trafficking in the United States, a 13 percent increase over the previous year. The effort has attracted strong bipartisan support.<br />Steven Wagner, who helped HHS distribute millions of dollars in grants to community groups to find and assist victims, said &#8220;Those funds were wasted.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Many of the organizations that received grants didn&#8217;t really have to do anything,&#8221; said Wagner, former head of HHS&#8217;s anti-trafficking program. <em>&#8220;They were available to help victims. There weren&#8217;t any victims.&#8221;<br /></em>. . .<br />Few question that trafficking is a serious problem in many countries, and the U.S. government has spent more than half a billion dollars fighting it around the world since 2000.<br />. . .<br />In the past four years, more than half of all states have passed anti-trafficking laws, although local prosecutions have been rare.<br />&#8230;<br />But information was scarce, so a CIA analyst was told to assess the problem in the United States and abroad. She combed through intelligence reports and law enforcement data. Her main source, however, was news clippings about trafficking cases overseas &#8212; from which she tried to extrapolate the number of U.S. victims.<br />&#8230;<br />Bipartisan passion melted any uncertainty, and in <strong>October 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, significantly broadening the federal definition of trafficking.</strong> Prosecutors would no longer have to rely on statutes that required them to prove a victim had been subjected to physical violence or restraints, such as chains. Now, a federal case could be made if a trafficker had psychologically abused a victim.<br />. . .<br />Just as the law took effect, along came a new president to enforce it.<br />Bell, with Prison Fellowship Ministries, noted that when Bush addressed the <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/United+Nations+General+Assembly?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/United+Nations+General+Assembly?tid=informline" target="">U.N. General Assembly</a> in 2003, he focused on the war in <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Iraq?tid=" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Iraq?tid=informline" target="">Iraq</a>, the war on terrorism and the war on trafficking.<br />Soon after Bush took office, a network of anti-trafficking nonprofit agencies arose, spurred in part by an infusion of federal dollars.<br />. . .<br />The CIA&#8217;s new estimate, which first appeared in a 2004 State Department report, has been widely quoted, including by a senior Justice Department official at a media briefing this year. It&#8217;s also posted on the HHS Web site.</p>
<p>But at a meeting of the task force this year, then-coordinator Sharon Marcus-Kurn said that detectives had spent &#8220;umpteen hours of overtime&#8221; repeatedly interviewing women found in Korean- and Hispanic-owned brothels. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to find any underlying trafficking that is there,&#8221; Marcus-Kurn told the group&#8230;.</p>

<p>The article is heavily edited to shorten to blog format and eliminated some of the history of the efforts to assess the situation, except to point out it is &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course I have a response, but am awaiting answers from experts I can contact. Stay tuned.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19watson.html?em&#038;ex=1193025600&#038;en=25a503b731871947&#038;ei=5087%0A">This story</a> has been going on for a few days:</p>
<blockquote><p>James D. Watson, who shared the 1962 Nobel prize for deciphering the double-helix of DNA, apologized “unreservedly” yesterday for comments reported this week suggesting that black people, over all, are not as intelligent as whites.</p>
<p>In an interview published Sunday in The Times of London, Dr. Watson is quoted as saying that while “there are many people of color who are very talented,” he is “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa.”</p>
<p>“All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours — whereas all the testing says not really,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>In a statement given to The Associated Press yesterday, Dr. Watson said, “I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said. There is no scientific basis for such a belief.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to comment on my opinion about Watson&#8217;s original statement, except to say that I doubt there have testing that takes into account all the factors that matter in education, such as nourishment and culture.  I do note that being brilliant in one area doesn&#8217;t prevent one from being a complete ass in other fields, and that I can think of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/05-06/jun24.html">at least one Nobel laureate in physics</a> who was convinced Black people were inferior.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a data kinda guy.  Its what I do on a regular basis, its what puts cat food in the cats&#8217; bowls, and pays the rest of the bills.  Even as a hobby, I like data&#8230; posts in my Comparing Presidents series take a very long time to write relative to other posts, and I tend to manage to put them out at the rate of one a week, on average.  (Some weeks more, some weeks, like last week, none.)  </p>
<p>And yet&#8230;  I keep thinking back to something my father, who as a physics is himself a data kinda guy, once told me.  He was trying to explain to me how semi-conductors work&#8230; so <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1972/bardeen-bio.html">John Bardeen</a> eventually came up in the conversation, which led to William Shockley.</p>
<p>And then my father said:  &#8220;There are some things that its best for society not to measure and not to know.&#8221; </p>
<p>And I thought of that a few years back when there were the various studies purporting to show that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence">Ashkenazi Jews score higher on IQ tests, on average, than other social groups</a>.  (Disclosure&#8230; I&#8217;m an Ashkenazi Jew, for what that&#8217;s worth.)   Obviously, there are idiots among Ashkenazi Jews &#8211;  I can introduce you to some of my relatives if you don&#8217;t believe it &#8211; but according to these studies, on average, Jews do better on these tests.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the problem&#8230;  if Jews do better &#8211; if that&#8217;s true, then&#8230; some groups do worse.  History shows it hasn&#8217;t taken a whole lot to justify, to allow, to encourage and even to demand the abhorrent treatment &#8211; from slavery to genocide &#8211; of certain groups.  Usually that&#8217;s been in the context of the group being perceived as inferior &#8211; using Black people as slaves was OK, you see, because everyone knew they weren&#8217;t entirely as human as White people.  The Holocaust in Germany was because Jews were bringing down the Aryan race &#8211; they may have been perceived as inferior in some ways, but superior in enough others to be thought of as a threat.  But these examples are everywhere&#8230;  racism is everywhere.  The Japanese haven&#8217;t thought much of non-Japanese, the Arabian peninsula has been cleansed (and kept that way) for over a thousand years, in Africa different tribes have been wiped out on a regular basis, etc.  </p>
<p>So it doesn&#8217;t take much.  And throughout history, charlatans and cranks have been enlisted to show whatever it is that had to be shown for the public to understand the need for the abhorrent treatment that was meted out.   Now, intelligence is a multi-faceted trait.  And there are all sorts of differences of all sorts of traits between various groups.   Which means that even if, on average all groups are &#8220;equally intelligent&#8221; &#8211; whatever that means &#8211; there&#8217;s plenty of room for those who will justify what they wish to justify.  And there are, of course, three added flies in the ointment&#8230;  The first is that evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to produce individuals or population groups that are identical, and the second, which grows out of that, is that individuals are not average &#8211; the world&#8217;s fastest sloth may not be able to keep up with the world&#8217;s slowest gazelle, but a faster than average German shepherd might be able to run with greyhounds.  The third&#8230; school children who are told they are inferior&#8230; perform worse.  Convince a whole generation of kids from group X that they are inferior, and the one outlier, and there are always outliers, who would have changed the world won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So&#8230; in this context (I&#8217;d like to ignore other contexts for this post) &#8211; is this an area that it is in the best interest of society as a whole to pursue?  If not, could/should such a thing be discouraged?  On the other hand, can it even be something good for us to know, and how?</p>

<blockquote><p>The potential failure of the sixth Ministerial will actually throw the WTO into a deep crisis. After failing to launch the so-called Millennium Round in 1999 in Seattle, this current round of negotiations was launched in Doha, Qatar in 2001. A second ministerial collapsed amidst massive civil society protests in September 2003. Negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped up by January 2005, yet are still stalled on the basic framework.</p>
<p>If the framework (modalities, in WTO-speak) is not completed by March, it will be extremely difficult for negotiators to wrap up the technical negotiations in time to send the final agreements to the US Congress before the expiration of Fast Track negotiating authority in July 2007.</p>
<p>The sixth Ministerial of the WTO follows on the heels of another failed Ministerial, the Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The Bush administration attempted to use the meeting to jump-start the stalled FTAA talks, but the meeting ended without even a declaration&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this a finale? Will the form of GATS continue in regional trade treaties? Will nation-states be players again as internal markets develop and give them more clout?</p>
<p>Will a world wide slow down affect responses?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is all over the news these days.</p>
<p>MRSA is a drug resistant form of a staph infection, and the deaths of young people have started a media stampede of spectacular stories. A few more bits of information (double checked with the world’s best nurse):</p>
<p>1. MRSA is not something new. &#8220;Best Nurse&#8221; dealt with it along time ago. It is infecting more young people. It can be deadly, or not.<br />2. My research indicates that MRSA does not kill more people than AIDS each year as reported (it is possible that the number of people who die with staph infections of all kinds is higher than AIDS deaths). I could be wrong.<br />3. Most people have some staph bacteria on their skin at some times.<br />4. Most MRSA infections still occur during hospitalization. Three reasons, compromised immune systems (lots of sick people), open wounds and failure of hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>So should you do anything about MRSA and staph in general?  Possibly.</p>
<p>A. If your child plays school sports or is on the Y swim team, call and ask about cleaning procedures in the locker rooms. Insist on thorough cleaning with disinfectants.<br />B. Check your child frequently for nicks and cuts, especially if they play contact sports. This will irritate your teens to no end. If you find a puffy spot with radiating red streaks, this could be a cellulitis infection – see the doctor. Otherwise be certain any wounds are clean and dab with triple antibiotic ointment – any questions, see a doctor. Lack of prompt healing – see a doctor. Any uncertainty – see a doctor. Persistent fever &#8211; see a doctor.<br />C. When you or a loved one are in a hospital, let it be known firmly that you expect all personnel, including physicians, to observe hand washing protocols. If they don’t, call the VP of Nursing and raise hell.<br />D. Teach everyone in the family that a fever is a message, and should be reported to parents.</p>

                                <p>I was dreaming about my lock on derricks and ports in Canada.  For the record, no one sold me Canada&#8217;s only main port on the Arctic Ocean. Mr. Broue bought it for $7 American. I bought the railroad that is the only link to the rest of the country(the Hudson Bay Railway)in my dream.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/19arctic.html?th&#038;emc=th">the US Coast Guard</a> is setting up shop on the NW passage.</p>
<blockquote><p>For most of human history, the Arctic Ocean has been an ice-locked frontier. But now, in one of the most concrete signs of the effect of a warming climate on government operations, the Coast Guard is planning its first operating base there as a way of dealing with the cruise ships and the tankers that are already beginning to ply Arctic waters.<br />&#8230;<br />The pullback in summer ice has caused the Coast Guard, led by Adm. Thad W. Allen, to plan its first Arctic operating base, probably near Barrow. <br />VideoMore Video » With increasingly long seasons of open water in the region, the Coast Guard has also begun discussions with the Russians about controlling anticipated ship traffic through the Bering Strait, which until now has been crossed mainly by ice-breaking research vessels and native seal and walrus hunters.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard says its base, which would probably be near the United States’ northernmost town, Barrow, Alaska, on the North Slope coast, would be seasonal and would initially have just a helicopter equipped for cold-weather operations and several small boats.</p>
<p>But given continued warming, that small base, which could be in place by next spring, would be expanded later to help speed responses to oil spills from tankers that the Coast Guard believes could eventually carry shipments from Scandinavia to Asia through the Bering Strait. Such a long-hoped-for polar route would cut 5,000 miles or more from a journey that would otherwise entail passage through the Panama Canal or the Suez.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is also concerned about being able to respond to emergencies involving cruise ships, which are already starting to operate in summers in parts of the Arctic Ocean. </p>
<p>And in yet a further kind of new activity abetted by warming seas, Royal Dutch Shell is preparing for exploratory oil drilling off Alaska’s Arctic coast beginning next year. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’m qualified to talk about the scientific issues related to global warming,” the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad W. Allen, said in an interview. “All we know is we have an operating environment we’re responsible for, and it’s changing.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/land.html">NOAA</a> has extra credit reading and source material for the curious.  </p>
<p>Since the slope of the land indicates that oil reserves might be available for harvesting, my dream gets better as oil companies and soverign nations vie for position.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/opinion/19bair.html?_r=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th&#038;oref=slogin">Sheila C. Blair of FDIC</a> offers an opinion on the mortgage crisis in the NYT.</p>
<blockquote><p>THERE have been many proposals to deal with the problems in the mortgage market. But the best place to begin is by looking at the poor lending standards and weak consumer protections at the root of the problem — in particular, the troubling loans called 2/28 and 3/27 subprime hybrids. They have starter interest rates of 7 percent or more for the first two or three years, and “resets” that raise rates to as much as 12 percent, causing monthly payments to increase by at least 30 percent.<br />When housing prices were rising, borrowers could sell or refinance their homes to pay off the loans before reset and avoid crippling monthly payments. But this year, as prices have dropped, more than $150 billion in these loans have undergone reset, and an additional $300 billion will do so before the end of 2008.<br />Merrill Lynch estimates that if home prices decline by just 5 percent, a quarter of subprime loans may enter default, resulting in losses of almost $150 billion.<br />A government bailout is not the answer. Bailouts erode market discipline, raising the likelihood of repeat episodes. And efforts to expand refinancing options will help only those borrowers who have enough equity to refinance.<br />What happens to those who are unable to refinance and cannot afford the rate resets? Most of their loans are managed by firms called servicers. Typically, servicers sit back and wait for people to default, then foreclose and sell the properties. But in today’s troubled housing market widespread foreclosures will only maximize losses for servicers.<br />Renegotiating terms loan by loan is too costly and time consuming. Servicers have modified only one percent of these mortgages that reset in early 2007.<br />So subprime servicers should take a more standardized approach: restructure all 2/28 and 3/27 subprime hybrid loans for owner-occupied homes in cases where the borrower has been making timely payments but can’t afford the reset payments. Convert these to fixed-rate loans at the starter rate.<br />This would be no bailout. These borrowers would still be required to make their monthly payments — at rates higher than what prime is today. Billions in savings would be generated by avoiding the administrative, legal, marketing and other costs of foreclosure, which can run to half or more of the loan amount. And avoiding foreclosure would protect neighboring properties and hasten the recovery of markets burdened by an excess supply of houses.<br />The mortgage crisis is growing, and the mortgage industry has the ability to help solve much of it on its own. Subprime borrowers need a better deal — one that they can afford.<br />Sheila C. Bair is the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice sounds sensible, and would peg loans at 7-8% fixed.</p>
<p>She does not say how many mortgages fit the description as a % of the loans outstanding, so how that might solve the problem I have no idea. And with multiple owners of a mortgage that are bundled separately, how one accomplishes the process needs explanation from someone in the services. I wonder whether the market is so inflexible that it cannot deal with specifics, or the players are.</p>
<p>There is another article on Citicorp and other banks attempts at solving the problem from a high roller point of view.</p>

                                <p>A reader sends me this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you tell me or post a blog on explaining why congress is wasting tax payer money and time and not to mention causing instability for the United States.  In my opinion this is why this country will not exist in its present form in the future because our congress, does not act as the voice of the people, they should be hung for treason, any senator that voted for this, this issue does not have any relevant meaning to the majority of this country!  here is the resolution:</p>
<p>In the last session of Congress, the Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.316) had 160 bipartisan cosponsors and was overwhelmingly passed the House International Relations Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to answer the questions posed directly&#8230;  I&#8217;m merely going to note that this has become a cause celebre on the right.  Of course, the same level of indignation isn&#8217;t directed toward <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/noni-mausa-on-gw-and-dalia-lama.html">GW&#8217;s meeting with the Dalai Lama</a> which has caused similar rifts with China&#8230; but perhaps its thought we don&#8217;t need China&#8217;s support (and money) for dealing with the situation in Iraq and North Korea.  </p>
<p>That said, I would argue that the administration is already severely antagonizing Turkey, and acting in violation of our NATO treaty accord with them.  (Not incidentally, it also means that the administration is in violation of Article VI of the Constitution, for our right wing friends.)  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm">Article 5</a> of the NATO treaty:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.</p>
<p>Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s Article 6:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:</p>
<blockquote><p>* on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France (2), on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;<br />    * on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>So what does it mean that the administration has chosen to arm, train, support and promise to defend the very folks who are engaging in cross border raids against a fellow NATO country, that itself is living up to its NATO obligations?  I note that this has been going on for a while now&#8230; and predates the House&#8217;s Armenian Genocide Resolution.  And I repeat that by violating a treaty obligation, the administration is also directly violating the Constitution.   So why the dual standard?</p>
