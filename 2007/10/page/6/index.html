                                <p>This post looks at active duty military personnel.  Nothing in this post is a surprise to me, but for those who you have had a problem with some of the posts in this series, I warn you, if you keep reading this one, you’re gonna plotz.  If you’re averse to plotzing, you’re best skipping the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Next… data includes ational Guard, Reserve, and retired regular personnel who happen to be on active duty, which often happens in wartime conditions.  Data from 1960 to 2005 comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0500.xls">Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>.   I also have data going back ten more years which I pulled from a DoD site which appears to be no longer active.  (However, the years for which the two series overlap match up perfectly.)</p>
<p>Here’s a line graph of the series.</p>

<p>There are peaks and valleys corresponding to America’s various wars, and the subsequent end of those wars.  Here’s the same information, color coded by President:</p>

<p>The biggest annualized increase in the military came during the JFK/LBJ years, when the country geared up to fight Vietnam.  The next biggest came when Reagan outpostured the USSR, followed by GW’s rather small increases (look very closely!) to fight in Iraq.  However, the extensive use of contractors for jobs previously reserved for the military probably means GW’s figures are somewhat understated.  The smallest drop in military personnel came under Carter, then Clinton.  Yup, Clinton, the guy usually criticized for decimating the US military, is only in the middle of the bunch.  Much bigger drops came under GHW, and that notorious military-hating pansy, Ike.  The biggest reduction in the size of the active duty military came under Nixon/Ford, at the end of the Vietnam War.   </p>
<p>What do we learn from this?  Well, JFK/LBJ geared up to fight a war.  GW hasn&#8217;t.  Reagan also did, but he didn&#8217;t have a war to fight.  And the President who best understood the military&#8230;  he realized that without a war to fight, it didn&#8217;t make sense to maintain the, well, &#8220;military industrial complex.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>One AB reader should take a bow.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/10/ah-stanfords-da.html">Brad DeLong</a> notes something I first learned from an AB reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>Francis Walker did not say that belief in laissez-faire determined &#8220;whether a man were an economist at all.&#8221; What Francis Walker said in &#8220;The Recent Progress of Political Economy in the United States&#8221; was: (a) the better part of economists had never imposed such a test, (b) the worse part of economists in the United States who posed as &#8220;guardians of the true [laissez-faire] faith&#8221; had lost their influence, and (c) the subject was much the better for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad also gave me the honor of including me in that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/10/a-gathering-of-.html">Gathering of the Clans</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic historians, historians of economic thought, practitioners of political economy, and others are painting themselves blue with woad and practicing with staves after reading Stanford&#8217;s David Kennedy&#8217;s trashing of Paul Krugman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, I forgot who our reader was so let me recheck <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/does-david-kennedy-consider-donald.html">my humble contribution</a>.  I see it was AB reader Rob who was checking out the comments at the contribution from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/review-of-the-c.html">Mark Thoma</a>.  Caption Video asked the right question – and reader Dan provided the answer.   Rob, Captain Video, and Dan should all take a bow.  Well done guys!</p>

<blockquote><p>NEW YORK &#038; BEIJING&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8212;-The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (NYSE:BSC) and CITIC Securities Co., Limited (SSE:600030), with unanimous approval from their respective Boards of Directors, today announced an agreement in principle to establish a comprehensive strategic alliance. This alliance will include sharing management expertise and technology to develop new capital markets products and businesses in China, establishing an exclusive joint venture combining the existing businesses of both companies in the rest of Asia, and cross-investments of approximately $1 billion in each firm by the other. The alliance will bring together Bear Stearns&#8217; capital markets expertise globally and market leading analytics with CITIC Securities&#8217; vast resources and extensive business network to better serve clients worldwide.<br />&#8230;<br />The joint venture will provide a wide range of capital markets services, including cross-border mergers and acquisitions advisory, international equity and fixed income capital markets with a particular focus on international offerings of Chinese companies, venture capital and private equity, asset management, and equity and fixed income services. The joint venture will serve as a conduit for international companies seeking access to Asian capital markets and for Chinese entrepreneurs, corporations and state-owned enterprises looking to access capital or invest outside of the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you know I have picked on the stock price of Bear Stearns as a barometer of who gets punished in the derivative markets, fair or not.</p>
<p>Is this venture a successful rebound of the market, or something else?  Not knowing the specifics makes an answer purely conjectural, but I do wonder if Bear Strearns learned anything from the loss of two of its funds, or whether this merely lets them go global and sovereign?</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a title="More articles about the World Trade Organization." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_trade_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org">World Trade Organization</a> made a last-ditch effort on Tuesday to salvage stalled global trade talks by asking the United States and Europe to lower their barriers to farm imports in return for greater export access to <a title="More news and information about India." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/india/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">India</a>, <a title="More news and information about Brazil." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/brazil/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Brazil</a> and other developing countries.</p>
<p>Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, said the group was trying to goad negotiators into making some compromises. <a name="secondParagraph"></a><br />A long proposal laying out possible compromises by 150 countries involved in the talks was issued at the World Trade Organization’s headquarters in Geneva. Officials said the draft was aimed at breaking a deadlock on issues that have eluded compromise since last summer.<br />Pascal Lamy, director general of the trade group, said the goal was to goad negotiators by laying out ambitious compromises they had been unwilling to make, in part because they did not see compromises by others. He said it would not be clear until September whether the new proposals would accomplish that goal.<br />The proposal was careful not to assign blame, but it also said time was running out on the possibility of a global trade deal. It was generally acknowledged to be a final attempt to save the talks, with the expectation that they would be declared a failure if it did not succeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13rupee.html?fta=y">NYT</a> reports on complaints issued by Brazil about US farm subsidies, especially commodities.</p>
<p>The stalled talks are emphasizing a deeper issue: In some ways, the balance of power between advanced and developing countries is shifting, politicians outside the West, including Mr. Nath, say. “The reality is that there is a new economic architecture,” Mr. Nath said in an interview this week in his New Delhi office. “This new economic architecture is going to have new windows and new doors. It can’t be wished away.”<br />India and Brazil are refusing to open their markets further to goods from Western countries without a substantial reduction in subsidies provided to Western farmers.<br /><em>On Thursday, Brazil filed a complaint with the W.T.O. about American farm subsidies. “This complaint attacks the entire U.S. farming policy,” Donizeti Beraldo, head of trade and international affairs at Brazil’s National Agriculture Confederation, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying. Then, referring to the trade talks, Mr. Beraldo added, “If the U.S. fails to advance on talks, they will be at risk of more complaints.”<br /></em>W.T.O. members are preparing for what is expected to be a decisive round of negotiations at the group’s headquarters in Geneva. On Monday, the presiding officers will release draft agreements that could form the basis of a compromise or, depending on the view of countries like India, give a firm indication that the current round of trade talks begun in 2001 is on its last legs.<br />Mr. Nath, whose office includes a shelf of thick W.T.O.-related publications, was quick to brush off questions about his flexibility, but still left no room for compromise.<br />&#8230;<br />The issue is not flexibility, he said: “It is removal of subsidies, which are a distortion of global trade&#8230;&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />India and Brazil are asking the United States to reduce the estimated $22 billion in subsidies that it allots to farmers, and the European Union to trim its farm aid from 55 billion euros ($75.8 billion), saying the subsidies keep food prices on world markets artificially low and make it difficult for farmers from developing countries to compete.<br />Advanced industrial nations would like to see a substantial reduction in the taxes on exports to countries like India and Brazil to give their manufacturers access to those fast-growing economies.<br />Mr. Nath said he is seeking some understanding from the United States. Despite the growth of outsourcing and high-technology jobs in India in recent years, agriculture still supports about two-thirds of the country’s citizens.<br />&#8230;<br />India is in the midst of an economic boom that has driven up stock market indexes, wages and real estate prices to near record highs. Still, Mr. Nath was quick to distance the country from developed- nation economies.<br />India “is so far away from the United States and the European Union,” he said.<br />“We have 300 million people that live on $1 a day&#8230;&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />Mr. Nath’s hard line in the W.T.O. talks was in marked contrast to his three-year stretch as commerce minister. There, his tenure has been characterized by an increasing openness to foreign investment and partnership at home. He has sometimes faced criticism that he is too business-friendly.

<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>The Chicken and His Eggs?<br />Whence the Silicon, Microsoft, Genetic engineering, Dot Com,… age?</p>
<p>Silicon Valley was born when some guys at Fairchild made a bunch of silicon chips and then went door-to-door selling them.  Or, maybe, it started when Edison (and others) recognized the principle of the transistor?  If there were never tube radios, would there have ever been transistor radios, or even a transistor?  Wherefore Edison’s transistor without Marconi?  And, … what inspired this guy Marconi to think of making a radio?  Obviously, there would have never been a Silicon Valley without the Russian Sputnik.</p>
<p>We hear, “Jobs and Wozniak invented the personal computer”.  Ah, but who would have heard of either if universities hadn’t started teaching computer science a few years earlier and Wozniak hadn’t taken those classes at UCB?  And, why all the interest in personal computers (see chips above)?  ALGOL was a scientific language.  Early uses of the computer were military (Turing &#038; Enigma, …), scientific, space flight, …  Industrially, computers began as CNC machines complete with rows of relays and/or tubes. Prior the two Steves, IBMs and CDCs were big as a barn and often used for bookkeeping.  Did they see the course and start running?  Or, were they running, looked around and saw they were on a course?  Whither our two Steves without Mr. Shockley and his chips?</p>
<p>Is it that innovation produce markets?  Or, is it that markets produce innovation?  Can both be true?  If necessity be the mother of invention, be need the mother of markets?  When, as in America, people buy so much stuff that they don’t really need; are markets for such real?  Or, are such markets artificial or contrived? </p>
<p>We hear that entrepreneurs do this and entrepreneurs do that.  What do entrepreneurs do?  Do they innovate?  They could hire creative types and turn them loose in research and development laboratories and thus abet innovation.  In the genetic engineering and chip-manufacturing fields, they do, or, they begin as innovators then become entrepreneurs.  But, other a few such industries, R&#038;D is expensive and risky.  If innovation is needed, it may be better to buy or steal it.   Everyday we read of examples where stealing someone else’s ideas works as well as R&#038;D, maybe better, and with very little risk (paying beaucoup millions infringement on a product that made you a few billion can be a good deal for both you and the inventor).  Yes, some entrepreneurs begin as inventors, but mostly, entrepreneurs excel at exploiting innovation and markets, i.e., theirs is a game of making and selling.  Big notch above skimming the tables, but most are not really the big heroes he said they were, are they now?  In re China, India, Africa, … we hear the term ‘New Markets’.  Possible, but ‘tis more likely they’re speaking to the extent that such markets (…. the born of need variety?) have been previously under/un-exploited.   Ah, exploitation, now there’s a task well suited the entrepreneur.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here&#8217;s one from programmer from reader Howard Covitz, who bills himself as a Computer Programmer and wannabe Economist&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I have a question about my logic in understanding the mainstream Economic view of Free Trade.  My recollection from my International Econ undergrad course (Ricardo and all that) is that the general welfare increases for all concerned when countries specialize in making what they can make at a comparable advantage.  While the math impresses me, I was always doubtful about what such simple Economic models leave out (in my case, I tend to suspect Institutional and Historical issues don&#8217;t get considered).  Regarding Free Trade, however, the stuff the simple model left out evaded me for many years, and only recently have I been able to articulate some very specific things.</p>
<p>The easiest, and perhaps trivial, &#8220;Thing It Leaves Out&#8221; is the friction on people&#8217;s psyches caused by economic disruption (which can be a monkey wrench in any economic model if considered and somehow quantified), and as pertains particularly to Free Trade economic disruption is the unequal burden such disruption causes on the least flexible&#8230;older workers, who have invested in years of skills and training (and &#8220;its harder to teach an old dog new tricks&#8221;).</p>
<p>The other aspect the simple Free Trade model leaves out, if my recollection is correct, is the following (and I don&#8217;t know if this is just a &#8220;conversion problem&#8221;, that is, a one time problem that happens as a country opens up its shores to free trade, or more long term).  I understand how the simple model illustrates that, for all concerned, the Cost of Goods gets lower.  But this does not pertain to Goods (and Services) that do not lend themselves to be exported or imported.  By and large, this would seem to include Real Estate and (despite some promising technological breakthroughs) Medical Care, and Education.  Aren&#8217;t these the VERY things that are causing problems in our current economy?  And is it possible that Free Trade is somehow exacerbating the problem (something about relative prices, and the cost of consumer items at Wal Mart being so fricking low&#8230;.lower than anyone really would need it to be, in no way making up for the rise in housing prices, medical care and education).  Something Alan Blinder I think once wrote in a intro Econ textbook also comes to mind,  about how there is a limit to how much technology can lessen the cost of Services, thus their relative price will always increase compared to other things in the economy.</p>
<p>I would love to hear some feedback.  Am I missing something fairly obvious? Thanks!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I would add he&#8217;s mostly right&#8230; what I think is left out is that while countries generally benefit (the country is better off focusing on what it does very well and trading for the rest, as opposed to focusing on things it sucks at doing), some individuals (those who are best at doing those things the country sucks at) will suffer.</p>

                                <p>A reader sent me this:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>What can one do, on an average citizen scale to make a  difference? Is there an organization to support, rally behind?  Also do you think that the current election coming up will change any of this.  I do think that current status of our executive branch has been too heavily influenced by corporate greed. T. Jefferson warned us about the influence of banking, it has the government by the neck and the only ones benefiting are Goldman Sachs, it is quite annoying to see so many ex-private executives  promoted to high ranking governmental positions, to me this is an outright sham.</p>
<p>Why would an executive making millions come to the governmental side?  I wouldn&#8217;t waste my time, unless I could make it lucrative for myself, i.e. keep my cronies at GSachs in the loop and bail them out when they get themselves in trouble and get greased on the side, not to mention Citibank and the current SIV problem and round table discussions on bail out package&#8230;.Free Markets no longer exist, it is controlled by those that influence politics and have enough at stake to tell the government what to do&#8230;As far as I am concerned that to me is the true problem for this country, the other problem is the debt loaded consumer is too worried about<br />losing their job and paying the bills that matters like this don&#8217;t even matter, and the wealthy could care less for things work out in their favor regardless, they are immune from worrying, then that leaves the middle class, of which is shrinking not because they are losing their jobs, but because inflation is eating at their salaries and they tend to fall into the poorer side of the spectrum, at which time they must worry to about putting food on the table, paying bills and trying to live a responsible life&#8230;all of which leads me to believe income gap widening leads to unrest and if left uncorrected we risk a  collapsing of the republic and our fate like all democracies&#8230;ultimately&#8230; end up failing&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I have any answer to the question, except to note that I think the public is not all that one sided.  We all agree we don&#8217;t like corruption, but we don&#8217;t agree on what corruption is &#8211; especially if its by someone on &#8220;our side.&#8221;  But aside from that, we don&#8217;t all want the same things or believe the same thing.  If we can&#8217;t even agree on basic facts, such as whether Reagan was a small government President by any definition, then how can we agree on policy prescriptions?  </p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t know what the solution is.  I guess trying to get out what the &#8220;facts&#8221; are is one.  Not particularly satisfying&#8230;  Your thoughts.</p>

<blockquote><p>More than 30,000 foreign troops are enlisted in the US Army, many of them serving in Iraq. Their reward for risking their lives for their adopted country is US citizenship.<br />&#8230;<br />They may have different reasons for joining the US Armed Forces, but all three are now among the more than 30,000 foreign soldiers fighting for America &#8212; not as Americans, but as a Mexican, a Portuguese and even a German. Without its foreign soldiers, the United States would have trouble coming up with enough troops to meet the demand in Iraq. The foreigners, for their part, take the dangerous job mainly for its biggest reward: US citizenship.</p>
<p>Since Sept. 11, 2001, the United States has granted US citizenship to 32,500 foreign soldiers. In July 2002, US President George W. Bush issued an executive order to expand existing legislation to offer a fast track to citizenship to foreigners who agree to fight for the US Armed Forces. About 8,000 non-Americans have joined the US military every year since then.<br />The foreigners already represent 5 percent of all recruits&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>With stop-loss orders being re-issued and some bonuses for &#8216;hard to find&#8217; specialties (officers) at $35,000, where are we headed?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br /><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/natio...eigners/?" page="'1"> Boston Globe</a>reports this:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent change in US law, however, gave the Pentagon authority to bring immigrants to the United States if it determines it is vital to national security. So far, the Pentagon has not taken advantage of it, but the calls are growing to take use the new authority.<br />Indeed, some top military thinkers believe the United States should go as far as targeting foreigners in their native countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little dramatic,&#8221; said Michael O&#8217;Hanlon , a military specialist at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and another supporter of the proposal. &#8220;But if you don&#8217;t get some new idea how to do this, we will not be able to achieve an increase&#8221; in the size of the armed forces.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>NATO is planning on outsourcing air support for southern Afghanistan, an area of some of the most intense fighting.  The alliance is intending to contract for some twenty helicopters. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>[T]his is the first time military outsourcing has been used as a workaround to domestic opposition of a military action.  This occurs at a time of broadening US public opposition to military outsourcing.</p>
<p>This summer Germany, France, Turkey, Spain and Greece all declined NATO requests for more helicopters to be sent to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban.  Recent polls in Germany have indicated that two thirds of the population are against a renewal of the German commitment to Afghanistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the year 2000, would you have thought that less than a decade later, nobody would bat an eye over the US using mercenary land and air forces?</p>
