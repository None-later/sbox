<blockquote><p>The richest Americans&#8217; share of national income has hit a postwar record, surpassing the highs reached in the 1990s bull market, and underlining the divergence of economic fortunes blamed for fueling anxiety among American workers. The wealthiest 1% of Americans earned 21.2% of all income in 2005, according to new data from the Internal Revenue Service. That is up sharply from 19% in 2004, and surpasses the previous high of 20.8% set in 2000, at the peak of the previous bull market in stocks.  The bottom 50% earned 12.8% of all income, down from 13.4% in 2004 and a bit less than their 13% share in 2000.The IRS data, based on a large sample of tax returns, are for &#8220;adjusted gross income,&#8221; which is income after some deductions, such as for alimony and contributions to individual retirement accounts. While dated, many scholars prefer it to timelier data from other agencies because it provides details of the very richest &#8212; for example, the top 0.1% and the top 1%, not just the top 10% &#8211; and includes capital gains, an important, though volatile, source of income for the affluent. The IRS data go back only to 1986, but academic research suggests the rich last had this high a share of total income in the 1920s.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="">Lawrence Kudlow</a> reacts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m surprised that today’s Wall Street Journal story on income inequality failed to mention that while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned 21.2 percent of all incomes in 2005, they now pay nearly 40 percent of all taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All taxes?</strong>  While Kudlow wants to spin the numbers, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012212.php">Kevin Drum</a> is more interesting in providing reliable information.  The Cliff Note version of what Kevin said has this:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the tax system is moderately progressive until you get up to the 5,000 richest people in the country, at which point it becomes regressive. However, this includes only federal income tax and payroll taxes. It doesn&#8217;t include excise taxes, state income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes. If you add in all that stuff, things get even flatter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin later reported on some data given to him by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012220.php">The Tax Foundation</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Tax Foundation may be a conservative outfit (they&#8217;re the ones who bring you &#8220;Tax Freedom Day&#8221; every year), but they emailed to let me know that they produced a report of their own last year showing overall tax rates at various income levels. It shows that federal taxes are progressive, state taxes are about flat, and total taxes are modestly progressive. Basically, the tax rate for the average worker is 28% while the tax rate for the richest taxpayers is 34% (and probably a bit lower than that for the very richest taxpayers).</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – Kudlow just makes shit up and the National Review lets him post it.  Go figure.</p>

<blockquote><p>The decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and environmental scientists has incensed some CNN.com readers while pleasing others. While Robert Ellis of Ohio says the award is &#8220;well-deserved&#8221;, Matthew Whitley of North Carolina says the peace prize is now a &#8220;laughingstock.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The actual story was not much better:</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN.com asked readers to share their thoughts on the Nobel Prize, global warming and Gore&#8217;s selection. The response was overwhelming. Many readers offered congratulations to the former vice president, while others expressed disdain for him. Some readers said it was a poor choice, while others flat out dismissed global warming as pseudoscience. Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity:</p>
<p>Roy Woodcock of Rochester, Washington<br />What a disgraceful choice. Al Gore has promoted bad science and dishonesty, but done nothing to promote peace. I must conclude that his selection is based on pure politics.</p>
<p>George Burns of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts<br />I can only imagine how upset Bill &#8220;looking for my legacy&#8221; Clinton is that he didn&#8217;t win it. Mr. Clinton really thought he had a chance at it when he tried to broker piece between [Yasser] Arafat and [Ehud] Barak. Arafat, another Nobel Peace Prize winner, rejected Barak&#8217;s offer of everything Arafat wanted. &#8230; Jimmy Carter, another Nobel Peace Prize winner, got North Korea to &#8220;promise&#8221; to terminate their nuclear weapons program. How&#8217;d that work out?</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – the next one was congratulatory but that was followed by reactions from two other rightwingers.  I would suspect that one might do better polling those who listen to Rush Limbaugh. Global warming is real and Al Gore has shown courage and foresight.  But what does CNN do?  Interview the Swift Boat crowd.  Pathetic!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: And I thought CNN was pathetic.  I forgot about the National Review crowd.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTA0MjgyNTdjYzRjY2EwNDFjMzA4ODU4YzZjZDFiOWY=">Iain Murray</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>How about that well known peace campaigner Osama Bin Laden, who implicitly endorsed Gore&#8217;s stance &#8211; and that of the Nobel committee &#8211; in his September rant from the cave</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWVmNzBiM2YxZWNjZTkxOGJjNGRiNmRhN2YzYzhmMzc=">Mark Levin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t think of anyone who has done more to bring peace to this world &#8211; from Rwanda to the Sudan, from Burma to North Korea &#8211; than Al Gore.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTIzNjE1NTQwZTc3ZmNmOTk4NWRlNzZkYmY2NTNmMzk=">KLo</a> provides a picture.  She earlier agreed with Rush Limbaugh that the prize should go to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDcwYzNjOWU5ZmU1OGE1NTM4NDg1MzcyNzk2ZmQ3YWU=">General Petraus</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking an ounce of intelligence, one would think they’d have just a little class.  Well, at least today they are beating up on an adult and not some 12-year old kid!</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/the-first-time-.html">Wired&#8217;s Danger Zone</a>, an op ed in the Chicago Trib by Robert Bateman, a US Infantry Officer who served in Iraq in 2005 and 2006.  Its called <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-oped1012contractoroct12,0,4399312.story">Blackwater and me: A love story it ain&#8217;t</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know something about Blackwater USA. This opinion is both intellectually driven as well as moderately emotional. You see, during my own yearlong tour in Iraq, the bad boys of Blackwater twice came closer to killing me than did any of the insurgents or Al Qaeda types. That sort of thing sticks with you. One story will suffice to make my point.</p>
<p>The first time it happened was in the spring of 2005. For various reasons, none of which bear repeating, I was moving through downtown Baghdad in an unmarked civilian sedan. I was with two other men, but they had the native look, while I was in my uniform, hunched in the back seat and partially covered by a blanket, hoping that the curtains on the window were enough to conceal my incongruous presence, not to mention my weapons. It was not the normal manner in which an Army infantry major moved around the city, but it was what the situation called for, so there I was. We were in normal Baghdad traffic, with the flow such as it was, in the hubbub of confusion that is generated when you suddenly introduce more than 1 million extra vehicles in the course of two years into a city that previously had only a few hundred thousand vehicles, and no real licensing authority.</p>
<p>As we approached one semi-infamous intersection along the main route used by Blackwater between the International Zone (a.k.a. the Green Zone) and the Ministry of Interior, one of Blackwater&#8217;s convoys roared through. Apparently, Blackwater&#8217;s agents did not like the look of us, the main body of cars in front of them. Their response was, to say the least, contrary to the best interests of the United States effort in Iraq. Barreling through in their huge, black armored Suburbans and Expeditions, they drove other cars onto the sidewalk even as they popped off rounds from at least one weapon, though I cannot say if the shots were aimed at us or fired into the sky as a warning. I do know one thing: It enraged me &#8230; and Blackwater is, at least nominally, on our side.</p>
<p>But imagining that incident from an Iraqi perspective made it clear to me that though Blackwater USA draws its paycheck from Uncle Sam, it&#8217;s not working in Uncle Sam&#8217;s best interests. If I was this angry, I can only imagine the reactions of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who encounter Blackwater personnel on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Iraq operates on the basis of an honor culture. Honor is, arguably, more important than Islam. Being dishonored, in word or deed, or even by implication, is enough to set the average Iraqi man to plotting his revenge. This is a culture in which political assassinations (usually based on honor issues) are not an abstraction but an everyday occurrence. Every time one of those Blackwater convoys drives an Iraqi civilian off the road because the most important thing in the world is the protection of their &#8220;principal,&#8221; they make a new enemy for the United States. Every time they ram another car to clear the way (and, yes, I&#8217;ve seen them do that), so that they could maintain their own speed and thereby minimize their exposure to &#8220;improvised explosive devices,&#8221; they make another enemy.

<p>I&#8217;ve noted a lot of this before.  And I realize that apparently its asking a lot for Blackwater to be held for responsible for damage to Iraqis.  But as I&#8217;ve also noted, Blackwater&#8217;s M.O. is to ensure that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/blackwater.html">average Iraqi can&#8217;t exactly distinguish between Blackwater and the US military</a>.  Which means that in effect, at least indirectly, Blackwater is also responsible for a lot of the deaths of US military personnel.  Why can&#8217;t they at least be held responsible for that?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/pdf/priv%20waste%20water%20complete.pdf">Rules of the market</a> is the mantra I have always advocated, rather than lumping everything together as &#8216;free&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cost reduction was the key benefit claimed by privatization. We conduct a meta analysis of all published econometric studies of water and waste production in cities since 1965. Little support is found for a link between privatization and cost savings. Cost savings are not found in water delivery and are not systematic in solid waste collection. Theoretical expectations for cost savings arise from the benefits of competition and the incentives of private ownership. However, empirical results show the importance of market structure, industrial organization of the service sector, and government management, oversight and regulation.</p>
<p>Most of the academic literature shows government contracting is a sensitive business that requires diligence, planning and management resources, and that it may be unsuited to certain goods and services. Additional rules for overseeing contracting processes may be necessary to ensure agencies prepare properly for contracting, and weigh all options for service provision. In Massachusetts, for example, a commission evaluates proposals for using private contractors prior to implementation.<br /><a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/4038/">In a separate paper</a>, Sclar found the commission saved money in Massachusetts by preventing inefficient contracting. He concluded:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The privatization law has created an atmosphere where state agencies are forced to think like private firms as opposed to assuming that a private provider working under contract will automatically solve any problem at a lower cost. It compels state agencies to think through the pitfalls that lie ahead and prods them to be sure they are making the highest and best use of scarce resources in difficult fiscal times. It avoids the squandering of public funds on untested ideas that has plagued privatization efforts in so many other places.</p>
<p>When agencies do not take it for granted that contracting is always efficient, they should be better prepared to manage contracts and may be more willing to reform service delivery systems by more effective means than privatization. At the very least, this research shows that policymakers have good reason to examine the cost-efficiency of the rapidly expanding federal contracting industry — which has doubled in size in the last five years. Any review of contracting practices should determine the conditions under which privatization is a viable way of improving government performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>A businessman uses rules of the market only, except when selling a product to increase volume of sales. Then he may rely on marketing, which is devised to sell anything. What or who is preventing rationality in government buying, even if one removes from the table the product is worth buying? No one appears able to tackle the issue?&#8230;or is it that procurement procedures are well insulated and protected? And why is this not more of an issue from all sides of the partisan divide?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br /><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08122.pdf">A GAO analysis</a> of DOD medical service consolidation includes the following:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>However, based on the working group’s methodology, the group intended to conduct a more detailed cost-benefit analysis of whichever of the three options senior DOD leadership selected, but the group’s work ceased once the fourth option was formally approved. While DOD approved the fourth option, DOD has not demonstrated that its decision to move forward with the fourth option was based on a sound business case. Based on GAO’s review of DOD’s business case, DOD has described only what it believes its chosen option will accomplish. The business case does not demonstrate how DOD determined the fourth option to be better than the other three in terms of its potential impact on medical readiness, quality of care, beneficiaries’ access to care, costs, implementation time, and risks because DOD does not provide evidence of any analysis it has performed of the fourth option or a sound business case justifying this choice.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Seems there is a movement afoot to do the economy one better.  There will be a conference <a href="http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/index.html">Beyond GDP </a>held in Brussels in November.<br />
<blockquote>GDP is the best-recognised measure of economic performance in the world, often used as a generic indicator of progress. However, the relationship between economic growth as measured by GDP and other dimensions of societal progress is not straightforward. Effectively measuring progress, wealth and well-being requires indices that are as clear and appealing as GDP but more inclusive than GDP—ones that incorporate social and environmental issues. This is especially important given global challenges such as climate change, global poverty, pressure on resources and their potential impact on societies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose:<br />
<blockquote>The European Commission, European Parliament, Club of Rome, OECD and WWF will host a high-level conference with the objectives of clarifying which indices are most appropriate to measure progress, and how these can best be integrated into the decision-making process and taken up by public debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This link is to a <a href="http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/indicators.html">list of indicators </a>that are being discussed.</p>
<p>While people look to come up with a better measurement, there is a movement coming to your town that has happened throughout the rest of the world: <a href="http://www.populareconomics.org/">The Solidarity Economy Network</a>.<br />
<blockquote>The Solidarity Economy offers an alternative economic framework to that of neoliberal globalization &#8211; one that is grounded in solidarity and cooperation, rather than the pursuit of narrow, individual self-interest.• It promotes social and economic democracy, equity in all dimensions (e.g. race, class, gender&#8230;) and sustainability.• It is pluralist and organic in its approach, allowing for different forms and strategies in different contexts, and is open to continual change driven from the bottom up whether in civil society or the marketplace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, a move to do the economy one better would not be complete without a discussion of the “corporation”.<br />There is a Summit at Faneuil Hall, Boston asking: <a href="http://www.summit2020.org/">Are Corporations equipped </a>for the 21st century?<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The Summit&#8230;is inspired by the growing tension between the emergence of the corporation as the world&#8217;s most powerful and innovative social institution and the growing severity of social and environmental problems that plague billions of people. As the tension between these two realities grows, the roles, responsibilities and rights of business are the subject of increasing controversy, as are the relationships of the corporation to government and civil society.</p>
<p>The Summit marks an historical moment for considering how the most influential social institution of our time can serve the broader public interest essential to its own long-term prosperity, and to begin designing corporate forms that recognize the reciprocity between private and public interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Total Federal Debt (TFD) stood was just over $9 trillion as of 9/30/2007 as compared to $8.45 trillion as of 9/30/2006.  The increase in TFD – which most folks would call the General Fund Deficit (GFD) – was $556.3 billion for the year.  (AB reader CoRev will likely go on another tirade since I did mention this term which he says cannot be used – but the heck with him).  Of course, the water carriers for this Administration prefer to talk about the Unified Deficit (UD), which is the increase in the debt held by the public (DHP).  That increase was only $220.3 billion BECAUSE intra-government holdings (IGH) of debt rose by a staggering $336 billion over the fiscal years.  IGH is mainly that Social Security Trust Fund reserve that the White House wants you to believe doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing.  Since 2005, the reason that the unified deficit has been rising is NOT a declining General Fund Deficit but rather increases in those Trust Fund surpluses.  That’s right – not only are the reserves rising but their rate of increase (the surplus) has been increasing.  But then the White House water carriers don’t want you to know this.  After all – there is no Trust Fund reserve and here at Angrybear, one of our readers says we are not allowed to talk about this staggering and continuing General Fund Deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100902231_pf.html">Steven Pearlstein</a> watched the GOP presidential debate so we don’t have to.  Excellent writing.  Cliff note version: none of them are serious about fiscal policy or economics in general.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: CoRev says he cannot find <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/pd_debtposactrpt.htm">this</a> even though I’ve given him the link.  CoRev says the total Federal debt cannot have passed $9 trillion even thought the U.S. Treasury says it has.  I wonder if CoRev’s next excuse will be: (a) the Treasury is also a liar; or (b) the Treasury does not exist.  My apologies to the rest of the AB readers who actually wish to make contributions in the comment box, but I’m really sick of CoRev’s false accusations.  Aren’t you?</p>

                                <p>This post is on the ownership economy…  it updates <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/ranking-presidents-ownership-economy.html">this post</a> using new information, though some of the old info will be repeated so the post makes some sense.  The methodology used in this post is the same as in previous posts used to rank Presidents by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Economic Growth</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">Fiscal Responsibility</a>, and the growth rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">personal income</a>, and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/ranking-presidents-issues-for-religious.html">Religious Right issues</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, a look at the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-s-500.html">growth in the S&#038;P 500, adjusted for inflation</a>.  This is a good measure of the economic activity of the financial markets – as the stock market goes up (in real terms), investors are better off, and retirement plans look better.  To summarize results:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwGftbL0VUI/AAAAAAAAAvI/96qpiZeBWg4/s1600-h/S%26P+500+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwGftbL0VUI/AAAAAAAAAvI/96qpiZeBWg4/s320/S%26P+500+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what does the graph show?  Well, Clinton did best, followed by Ike and then GHW.  Yes, Ike.  And GHW.  Three administrations had negative real growth in the S&#038;P 500…  GW, Carter and Nixon/Ford.  </p>
<p>What about homeownership?  Well, simply looking at appreciation is not a good measure of how well people are doing.  A better measure is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-home-ownership.html">home ownership</a>.  Anyone paying attention may recall it wasn’t that long ago – perhaps two or three years ago – that GW was crowing about how many home owners there were in this country.  Here’s a summary of how that figure has changed over the various administrations:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwGfo7L0VTI/AAAAAAAAAvA/rJNzdY5yTwA/s1600-h/homeownership+summary.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwGfo7L0VTI/AAAAAAAAAvA/rJNzdY5yTwA/s320/homeownership+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Data doesn’t go back far enough to include Ike, but the top three slots are held by the three Democratic administrations, followed by GW and Nixon/Ford.  Home ownership fell under GHW, and even more under the Reagan.</p>
<p>But home ownership ignores a few details… namely, how much of one’s home one actually owns.  More info <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-owners-equity-as.html">home owners&#8217; equity</a>…</p>
<p>Here’s a summary….</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7CRrL0VyI/AAAAAAAAAy4/tRBa80UJ-9A/s1600-h/owner%27s+equity+summary.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7CRrL0VyI/AAAAAAAAAy4/tRBa80UJ-9A/s320/owner%27s+equity+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Another measure is total net worth, that is, total assets less total liabilities.  Sadly, this data is only available for households + nonprofits.  My <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-net-asset.html">post on that subject</a> went up just yesterday.  Here’s a summary of the results…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7CDrL0VxI/AAAAAAAAAyw/AgejLqlMVm4/s1600-h/net+worth,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7CDrL0VxI/AAAAAAAAAyw/AgejLqlMVm4/s320/net+worth,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While each of these measures captures some element of the ownership economy, each has flaws.  Thus, the best measure of how well the American public fared on “ownership issues” during the administration of each President would combine that President’s rankings on each of the series.  </p>
<p>For instance, Ike is only ranked on three of the series – there isn’t enough data to rank him on home ownership.  Thus, we can produce a weighted sum of ranks for Ike as follows…  Because he is ranked 2 on S&#038;P 500 growth (of 8 administrations), ranked sixth on owner’s equity as a percentage of home value, and fourth on growth of real net worth, his weighted sum of ranks is equal to:</p>
<p>[(2/8) + (7/8) + (4/8)]/3 = 0.5417.  </p>
<p>The same process is followed for the other Presidents.  Because each of the others appears in 4 series, the computation is marginally different.  For instance, for JFK/LBJ:</p>
<p>[(5/8) + (2/7) +  (4/8) + (2/8)]/4 = 0.4152</p>
<p>So here’s how it stacks up…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7B-bL0VwI/AAAAAAAAAyo/5tRWMwXgAXk/s1600-h/Ownership+Economy+Rankings.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rw7B-bL0VwI/AAAAAAAAAyo/5tRWMwXgAXk/s320/Ownership+Economy+Rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Americans did best, by far, under Clinton.  Not surprising… he came out tops on three of four series, and third on the on Annualized Percentage Change in Owner&#8217;s Equity as a Percent of Residential Real Estate.  I realize that Rudy G. doesn’t want to go back to the 1990s, but more Americans seem to have fared well then than at any other time.  JFK/LBJ followed, Carter came next, with Ike tied.  Reagan was fifth.  GW and Nixon/Ford tied for sixth… though who wants to bet on whether GW moves up or down when all the data from his term comes in?  (Remember, the guy hasn’t said one peep about the Ownership Economy in a while.)  GHW is (currently) in last.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>When Al Qaeda struck the Cole during October 2000, President Clinton decided we should go after them by taking down the Taliban when we had any evidence it was Al Qaeda.  The evidence became available to the White House after January 20, 2001.  For the life of me – I never understood why Bush-Cheney waited until the fall of 2001 to go after these thugs. </p>
<p>It seems Lynne Cheney went on the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/10/11/lynne-cheney-stewart">Daily Show</a> and offered an explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Cheney, reiterated this point on The Daily Show, claiming that terrorists regularly struck between 1993 and 2001 but not since 9/11. “It’s been more than six years. And that is not an accident. … There were many attacks between 1993 and the World Trade Centers coming down in 2001,” Cheney said.  Stewart rebutted Cheney’s claim by listing off the many terrorist attacks around the world since 9/11 … Cheney replied that attacks on other countries were not relevant to the discussion: “Yes, yes. But we’re talking about American interests.” The audience booed Cheney’s remarks. An incredulous Stewart responded, “Aren’t we interested in [attacks on those countries]? I’d assumed they were our allies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She should have been booed, but also notice how she contradicts herself.  Those attacks between 1993 and 2001 were abroad.  And according to Lynne Cheney, they don’t count.  Memo to our allies in Britain and Spain – the wife of the Vice President thinks you don’t count either.</p>

                                <p>Someone once described the W administration as the Corleone family if everyone was Fredo.  (Anyone know the origin of that one?)  The behavioral process is attractive to the base, so the Thompson campaign wants to seize the mantle (is there anyone in the running from either major party better equipped to campaign as Fredo?) and capitalize on that theme.  But all that said &#8211; I know who Fredo1 is, and I guess Fredo2 is probably Alberto Gonzalez, but can you name the other Fredos, <a href="http://thompson08.mojo4m.com/1635/">numbers 3 through 7</a>?</p>
