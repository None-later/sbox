                                <p>This post attempts to rank Presidents by changes in issues important to the Religious Right:  abortions, marriage and divorce, and single parents.  This isn’t to say that these issues aren’t important to almost everyone else as well, but I don’t think I’m stereotyping members of the Religious Right by noting that many of them use one or more of these issues as part of a litmus test to determine how they should cast their ballot.  Interestingly enough, those who oppose them on these issues generally hope for the same trends; those on both sides of the abortion issue, for instance, want to see fewer abortions – Bill Clinton famously declared he hoped abortion would one day be :”safe, legal and rare.”  Similarly, most people can agree that society would probably be better off if marriages were more stable, or if more families grew up in two-parent households.  That isn’t to say that both sides agree on how to get there, of course, so its interesting to see how the Presidents most favored by the Religious Right have produced on these issues.</p>
<p>The methodology used in this post is the same as in previous posts used to rank Presidents by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Economic Growth</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">Fiscal Responsibility</a>, and the growth rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">personal income</a>, and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/ranking-presidents-ownership-economy.html">ownership economy</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with what may be the biggest lighting rod issue of them all over the last few decades… abortions.   Here’s a line graph showing how abortions per thousand live births have evolved since 1975, 2 years after Roe v. Wade:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx77L0VjI/AAAAAAAAAxA/Rwu0hr3C5ck/s1600-h/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx77L0VjI/AAAAAAAAAxA/Rwu0hr3C5ck/s320/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that the rate increased dramatically from the beginning slowed around 1977 or so, and then peaked in 1982.  Its been declining ever since.  The source of the data, plus a bar chart showing that series (and a few others) broken out by President are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-abortions.html">here</a>.  Next, a chart ranking the Presidents:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx07L0ViI/AAAAAAAAAw4/v749vjpz4Lc/s1600-h/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpx07L0ViI/AAAAAAAAAw4/v749vjpz4Lc/s320/abortions+per+thousand+live+births,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I left out both the Nixon/Ford and GW administrations since only 2 years of data is available for each.  Note that neither administration fares well by this measure.</p>
<p>The best performing President is Clinton.  I note that in the two years since he left office, the rate of decrease of abortions per thousand live births has slowed, so this is not just a matter of catching a trend.  Carter on the other hand, may well be a victim of time and circumstances.  </p>
<p>Another fine morality related series deals with the net marriage rate… that is, the rate at which marriages exceed divorces.  Folks on the Religious Right would like to see this number as high as possible – first, because that means either more marriages (i.e., fewer people, ahem, living in sin), fewer divorces, or some combination of both.  Here’s a line graph showing what the series looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxv7L0VhI/AAAAAAAAAww/91rZryPwiPQ/s1600-h/net+marriage+rate,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxv7L0VhI/AAAAAAAAAww/91rZryPwiPQ/s320/net+marriage+rate,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The data before 1970 is spotty, but it does appear that the net marriage rate dropped in the 1950s, and rose a bit in the 1960s.  Since then, the net marriage rate only seems to have risen briefly, dropping in most periods.  The source of the data, plus a bit more information, can be found <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-net-marriage-rate.html">at this post</a>.  And now a summary of changes by Presidency – note that in an attempt to approximate the administration periods, data for Ike is for 1955 and 1960, and for JFK/LBJ its for 1960 and 1970.  (Given the pattern observed, this should give the benefit of the doubt to Ike, and penalize JFK/LBJ slightly.)   So here’s a summary:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxq7L0VgI/AAAAAAAAAwo/m63R7Q3enS4/s1600-h/net+marriage+rate,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxq7L0VgI/AAAAAAAAAwo/m63R7Q3enS4/s320/net+marriage+rate,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The net marriage rate seems to have increased only under Carter and JFK/LBJ.  It decreased the least under GW, followed by Clinton and Reagan.  The biggest declines occurred under GHW and Nixon/Ford.</p>
<p>And now, children living in two parent households.  Data is available for 1960, and then annually from 1967 forward.  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxl7L0VfI/AAAAAAAAAwg/fikqrX6xDfE/s1600-h/children+in+2+parent+families,+line+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxl7L0VfI/AAAAAAAAAwg/fikqrX6xDfE/s320/children+in+2+parent+families,+line+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Sadly, the series seems to have simply trended down, with only a flat areas and only one noticeable upward bump (from 1999 to 2000).  </p>
<p>Here’s a summary:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxg7L0VeI/AAAAAAAAAwY/MLAWfjqz1kA/s1600-h/children+in+2+parent+families,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rwpxg7L0VeI/AAAAAAAAAwY/MLAWfjqz1kA/s320/children+in+2+parent+families,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The percentage of children in two parent households declined under every President.  It declined the least under Clinton, followed by JFK/LBJ and Reagan.  (Reagan follows slightly, but we’ll give him the tie.)  The President who did the worst was Carter.</p>
<p>Now, let’s combine these rankings using a weighted average…  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwpxV7L0VdI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/L5TvgW5_qUA/s1600-h/Religious+Right+Rankings.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RwpxV7L0VdI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/L5TvgW5_qUA/s320/Religious+Right+Rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Overall, the administrations under whom the Religious Right should have been happiest were those of JFK/LBJ and Clinton.  Aside from indicating that perhaps the Religious Right votes for the wrong candidates, what else can we learn from this?  Well, these are also the two presidents with the fastest economic growth rates, and did best at measures of personal income.  Wealthier people have more and better options.  Additionally, both these administrations had a focus on the poorest individuals – JFK/LBJ had the War on Poverty, and Clinton famously felt people’s pain.  But whenever Clinton and social issues are mentioned, inevitably someone insists credit belongs either to the Republican Congress or the Welfare Reform Act.  So let’s take a moment and look at those claims, shall we?</p>
<p>First, on abortions…  the annualized rate from 92 to 94, the last year before he took office, to the last year before the Republicans took Congress, the decline in the abortion rate per thousand live births declined 2.4% a year.  For the remaining six years it declined 1.8% a year.  And looking only at the post Welfare Reform Act… the decline remained at 1.8% a year.  If the Welfare Reform Act had any effect at all, it is not discernible in the data.  And if Newt and Company had any effect, it was to slow the decline in the rate of abortions.</p>
<p>What about the net marriage rate?  Well, the net marriage rate stayed constant from 92 to 94, and from 92 to 96.  Looking at the 94 to 00 period, the decline was 1.1% a year, and from the 96 to 00 period, it was 1.7% a year.   Now, that said, we do see an improvement in the number of children living in two parent homes after the Welfare Reform Act was passed.  This, together with the improving economy (it is said, after all, that the biggest cause of divorce in the US in money problems), seems to have provided an incentive to families to stay together when there were children involved.  </p>
<p>So from this, we can conclude…  if the Republican Revolution had an effect on any of these issues separate from the Welfare Reform Act, it was to arrest the decline in abortions.  The Welfare Reform Act was a bit more mixed… it may not affected the rate of abortions per live birth, seems to have encouraged divorces (and/or discouraged marriages) when there were no children, and had the opposite effect when children were involved.</p>
<p>What about other Presidents?  GW comes in third, but that’s probably a result of his record on abortion not being counted.  My guess… when more data is available GW will plummet to a ranking more like those we’ve seen him occupy on most other series, namely at or close to the bottom.  This would move Reagan up to a distant third – also something we’ve become accustomed to seeing on these series.  </p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me that many folks on the Religious Right would be less likely to vote for the Presidents that did the best job of getting results in those areas important to them, and more likely to vote on those who did a poor job on their issues.  Most voting theory seems to assume that people at least make some effort to vote on candidates likely to delivery on issues important to them.  Clearly, this is not the case for a sizable segment of the US voting public.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119179940086451698.html?mod=hps_us_whats_news">Amy Schatz</a> notes that Fred is indeed a small government conservative:</p>
<blockquote><p>While all the party&#8217;s leading candidates have embraced fiscal restraint, the former Tennessee senator seems likely to go further than his rivals. He has hinted at politically risky proposals to rein in Social Security and Medicare benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it would seem both Fred and Amy flunked basic arithmetic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Thompson has advocated reining in discretionary spending and has been particularly critical of the Medicare drug-benefits program that Congress passed four years ago. He said he wouldn&#8217;t have voted for it. &#8220;I know this probably isn&#8217;t a real popular thing to say, but we couldn&#8217;t afford this prescription-drug bill,&#8221; Mr. Thompson said last week on a swing through Iowa, home of Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, who helped push the program through Congress. &#8220;We basically put a $72 trillion commitment on top of an already-broken entitlement system. Not a responsible thing to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was also critical of the way this benefit was designed giving a huge incidence of the subsidy to Big Pharma and not finding a tax base to fund this new entitlement.  But the $72 trillion figure struck me as a bit off so I checked with <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=fred_thompson_loses_tens_of_tr">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why then is Fred Thompson quoted in the WSJ as saying that the Medicare prescription drug benefit added $72 trillion to country&#8217;s obligations, without any explanation to readers that Mr. Thompson is off by a factor of seven. The projections of the cost of the Medicare Part D over an infinite horizon are less than $10 trillion. (Before anyone gets too concerned about even this seemingly large number [approximate 1.0 percent of future income], remember that it is driven by the assumption that the government will forever continue to grant patent monopolies that allow the drug companies to charge ever higher prices, instead of adopting a modern system for financing drug research. If we fix the system, all drugs can be sold at $4 per prescription.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The $72 trillion is likely the sum of the modest infinite horizon Social Security shortfall, the larger Medicare Part D shortfall, and the massive General Fund shortfall.  If Fred Thompson is so clueless to attribute all of this to Medicare Part D, I don’t want him in charge of our fiscal future.  And the Wall Street Journal should not allow Amy Schatz to cover economic issues if she can’t spot such an egregious error.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Continuing from my last posting, I stated the World Bank has seen the light. It has put out a report: <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/214578-1110886258964/20748034/All.pdf">Where is the Wealth of Nations</a>? <br />Reason Online has an interview with the prime author<a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/120764.html"> Kirk Hamilton</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oil, soil, copper, and forests are forms of wealth. So are factories, houses, and roads. But according to a 2005 study by the World Bank, such solid goods amount to only about 20 percent of the wealth of rich nations and 40 percent of the wealth of poor countries.</p>
<p>So what accounts for the majority? World Bank environmental economist Kirk Hamilton and his team in the bank&#8217;s environment department have found that most of humanity&#8217;s wealth isn&#8217;t made of physical stuff. It is intangible&#8230;Hamilton&#8217;s team found that &#8220;human capital and the value of institutions (as measured by rule of law) constitute the largest share of wealth in virtually all countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The World Bank study defines natural capital as the sum of cropland, pastureland, forested areas, protected areas, and nonrenewable resources (including oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals). Produced capital is what most of us think of when we think of capital: machinery, equipment, structures (including infrastructure), and urban land. But that still left a lot of wealth to explain. &#8220;As soon as you say the issue is the wealth of nations and how wealth is managed, then you realize that if you were only talking about a portfolio of natural assets, if you were only talking about produced capital and natural assets, you&#8217;re missing a big chunk of the story,&#8221; Hamilton explains.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is intangible capital. That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions. Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For under developed or undeveloped countries you can see what direction they have to go in. But what about our country? We have had discussions about infrastructure. We have talked about the need for education. When I skimmed the report (200+ pages), savings was a must in order to be able to invest in the intangible capital. We have debated the share of benefit a person receives from the country&#8217;s infrastructure and institutions based on the wealth and/or income they control. We always argue about where growth comes from such that it raise all boats. (Sing that jingle!) And there is the “free market” debate revolving around regulation. Oh that nasty governance issue! If only we hadn&#8217;t signed on to form a more perfect union.</p>
<p>My quick assessment of this report is that it is a testament to the misdirection of our policies. We do not make money from money even though we have been trying to. You did catch the reference to “labor”. These breakouts of wealth suggest that there is a bottom limit to taxation as taxation reflects our investment in us. In the study, European countries dominate the top wealth and England is not in the top 10. This report implies that the wealthy do benefit more from the country&#8217;s structure and investment because the majority of their wealth is from this “intangible capital”. The few of the wealthy have accumulated their wealth from the investment of the many in the intangible.   It also means capital gains should be tax equal to labor if not higher.<br />
<blockquote>Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>With only 18% of wealth from produced capital and less from natural resources as a country becomes wealthier, freeing up money to produce money as we have been promoting is very poor investment strategy it would seem when 77% of our wealth is from the human element. In a broad sense, we are talking about what ideology concerning the conduct of human life works best to produce wealth.<br />
<blockquote>An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth. For example, Switzerland scores 99.5 out of 100 on the rule of law index and the U.S. hits 91.8. By contrast, Nigeria gets a score of just 5.8, while the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo obtains a miserable 1 out of 100.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not just that we need to invest in education,or just have a legal system or just fix the bridges. These can be measured as noted in the World Bank <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/doing-business-world-bank-ranking.html">Doing Business </a>chart.</p>
<p>“Trust” seems to be the real intangible the report is talking about. We as a whole can be educated to the hilt, but if we can&#8217;t trust that our efforts will be put to constructive use, we have problems. Think habeas corpus, FISA, election fraud, threatening of the press, intimidation of speech, extension of free speech to none human entities, the equating of one voice-one vote to spending of one&#8217;s money, K Street project, etc. Think of the use of fear. If only a few are educated to the hilt or have access to the governance, we can not build capital.</p>
<p>If the country is 100 people large, but only 10 trust each other to do for each other, then how much wealth can they actually build if 93% of the 77% of intangible capital is related to law access (trust) and education (the removal of fear; trust) of the populace? But then, our founders seemed to have already reasoned this. Jefferson started the free education to including college!</p>
<p>So why should this report seem so “new”. This makes me think of the years of government bashing we have been hearing from the republican side. Reagan&#8217;s infamous “nine most dangerous words in the English language: I&#8217;m from the government and I&#8217;m here to help you.” It makes me realize we have to dump the Bush/neocon ideology here and in our foreign policy if only to remove the fear so that trust can return.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton&#8217;s example of the difference in thinking is in when he discusses pollution as a resource management issue:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s not a pollution problem; it&#8217;s a natural resources management problem. How do you maintain soil quality? How do you generate profits with the assets that you have, which in this case is land that can be invested in other things? The problem in China is they&#8217;ve figured out how to grow 9 percent a year pretty successfully but they&#8217;re now facing the environmental consequences of uncontrolled growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is policy that he is talking about. Policy of what to spend on and policy governing relationships both boiling down to regulation. (What was that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/friedman-externalities-and-difference.html">Milton quote </a>the other day?)We&#8217;re talking government. I interpret this report as making a case that shrinking government to where it can be drowned in a bath tub is not the way to build wealth. The market will not solve our problems of growth for us. It is not the answer to Save the Rust Belt&#8217;s question of how to save the rust belt? We have to do it and we have to do it in a manor that is inclusive for that is the only way to maximize the “intangible capital”. It also means we have to do as Cactus is attempting to do; qualify our policy results related to specific ideology. Just charting to see what GDP is doing or just looking at supply and demand theory won&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s just bench racing.</p>
<p>The World bank has done some qualifying and changed their ideology:<br />
<blockquote>Hamilton: In the old days, we thought if you built the infrastructure then development would come-the Field of Dreams model of development. It turns out to be a lot harder than that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dare I suggest that the World Bank has discovered that an economy exists for our benefit and not for it&#8217;s own sake? Maybe they read our Declaration and our Constitution.</p>

                                <p>AB readers likely know I have not jumped on the Obama bandwagon just yet, but <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200710070003?f=h_latest">Fred Barnes</a> is working overtime to get me there:</p>
<blockquote><p>BARNES: Yeah, I doubt that she&#8217;ll pick him. You know, I&#8217;ve thought for a long time that Obama&#8217;s not in quite as strong a position on the war in Iraq as he really thinks he is. Remember, when he famously came out against the war, it was back in a time when the entire world believed that Saddam Hussein in Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that he would probably be willing to use them himself at some time or pass them along to terrorists who would use them. And yet, Barack Obama was against going to the war at that point. I don&#8217;t think that shows that he is very strong on national security, which he needs to be. But that argument&#8217;s not going to be used against him in the Democratic primaries. It would, however, by Republicans in a general election. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – Fred was trying to trash Senator Obama here but read his insightful 2002 speech as I turn the microphone over to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/055284.php">Steve Benen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2002, Barnes was wrong about Iraq; Obama was right. That Obama didn&#8217;t follow the mistaken judgment of the DC establishment, Barnes said, necessarily means that Obama isn&#8217;t strong on national security. What&#8217;s more, Barnes believes this insightful criticism of Obama&#8217;s accurate judgment would be &#8220;used against him&#8230; by Republicans in a general election,&#8221; should he win the Democratic nomination. Oh, things one learns from Fox News&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fred sums up the modern GOP nicely.  Vote for us as we are incredibly stupid!</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/war-on-the-chea.html">Mark Thoma</a> follows up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/paying-for-war-thomas-friedman-is.html">this discussion</a> with a post called <em>War on the Cheap</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>here&#8217;s a way the costs are being reduced: by making sure soldiers who served in Iraq are not eligible for education benefits after they return. This is not how we should be saving money or treating our soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And we were complaining that Bush vetoed SCHIP!  So George W. Bush limits his fiscal conservatism to screw the kids of the working poor and screw the troops.  But look – the amount of savings from these two large cuts in small programs (as Max Sawicky might call this) are a drop in the bucket to the General Fund deficit.  Looking at table B-78 from <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/tables07.html">this source</a>, it seems that Bush’s own economists believe that total Federal debt will exceed $9 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, which translates into a deficit of $556 billion for the year.  OK, they projected a much small rise in the debt held by the public as the surpluses of the Trust Funds was projected to be around $300 billion.  Their projection for fiscal year ending October 31, 2008 looks even worse. OK, we know they’ve overestimated these things before to declare some sort of great improvement when the actual increase turned out less than their phony forecasts.  Nonetheless, the General Fund is still huge and all this garbage about an improving unified deficit is nothing more than the rising Social Security surpluses. </p>
<p>I think it’s time to go big picture as to how much the government purchases and where we raise taxes.  Our first graph shows defense spending (Def) non-defense Federal purchases (NonDef) and state &#038; local government purchases (SL).  Back in the last year of that leftwing high tax Clinton bad old days, total government purchases were 17.5% of GDP.   As of 2007QII, the fiscal responsible George W. Bush made sure we only spent 19.4% of GDP on total government purchases.  OK – we had do that stupid war in Iraq so the fact that defense spending went from 3.75% of GDP to 4.75% of GDP is no surprise.  Non-defense Federal purchases actually went up – a bit.  But then non-defense Federal purchases are only 2.3% of GDP.  The state &#038; locals, however, have seen their purchases rise from 11.7% of GDP to 12.3% of GDP.  Yes, we do want our schools, our police and fire protection, and our roads maintained. I don’t see anyone in the Republican Party suggesting any significant reduction in government purchases as most of these fellows are wedded to Endless War.</p>
<p>Our second graph breaks up what we spend in taxes between Federal income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, and taxes paid to the state &#038; locals.  In 2006, they totaled 32% of GDP – which does sounds like a lot.  Of course, their total was almost 34% of GDP back in 2000.  So what happened?  Well, the state &#038; locals still have their take at almost 13.5% of GDP &#8211; while our payroll taxes, which are supposed to be contributions to our Social Security retirement benefits – are still around 7% of GDP.  What happened was a big dip in what we paid in terms of Federal income taxes followed by only a partial recovery.  While we used to pay as much as Federal income taxes as we paid to the state &#038; locals, last year Federal income taxes were only 11.7% of GDP.  </p>
<p>Now I know the rightwing excuse makers are ready to pounce with their supply-side stupidity so let me point that real GDP as of 2007QII was a mere 16.52% greater than it was as of 2000QIV.  Hmm – population grew by 6.55% over this period.  The 9.35% increase in per capita income is less than 1.4% per year.  Not exactly a great performance.  </p>
<p>So how do we return to fiscal sanity if we are stuck with Endless War and this GOP fear of raising taxes?  You might say – cut entitlements.  That seems to be the GOP mantra these days.  But George W. Bush has increased entitlements with his bloated Prescription Drug Benefit that he loves to brag about in the same breathe he says he cut taxes.  The only large pot of cash that seems to be left is those Social Security benefits that we thought we were paying payroll contributions for.  Every time this GOP crew talks about Social Security “reform” – hold onto your wallet.  You might think they were talking about the sensible stuff we see from <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/10/guide-to-posts-on-social-security.html">Andrew Samwick</a> but if that’s all they are going to do, the total Federal debt will continue to rise relative to GDP.  No I suspect their real game plan is to slash your benefits but leave those payroll taxes quite high.  Or maybe they’ll pass the buck to the state &#038; locals so regressive sales taxes will have to be raised. </p>
<p>Now I began this by asking a question to Dana Perino, but I should know better.  She’ll never give an honest and intelligent answer to this question.  After all, she works for George W. Bush.  So might I get a straight answer from the Siamese triplet known as Rudy McRomney or its clone – Fred Thompson?  I’m not holding my breathe waiting for it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_alarming_parallels_between_1929_and_2007">American Prospect</a> has published an article by Robert Kuttner on parallels between 1929 and 2007.</p>
<blockquote><p>In researching the book, I devoted a lot of effort to reviewing the abuses of the 1920s, the effort in the 1930s to create a financial system that would prevent repetition of those abuses, and the steady dismantling of the safeguards over the last three decades in the name of free markets and financial innovation.<br />Your predecessors on the Senate Banking Committee, in the celebrated Pecora Hearings of 1933 and 1934, laid the groundwork for the modern edifice of financial regulation. I suspect that they would be appalled at the parallels between the systemic risks of the 1920s and many of the modern practices that have been permitted to seep back in to our financial markets.<br /><em><strong>Although the particulars are different</strong></em>, my reading of financial history suggests that the abuses and risks are all too similar and enduring. When you strip them down to their essence, they are variations on a few hardy perennials &#8211;<em> excessive leveraging, misrepresentation, insider conflicts of interest, non-transparency, and the triumph of engineered euphoria over evidence</em>.<br />The most basic and alarming parallel is the <strong>creation of asset bubbles</strong>, in which the purveyors of securities use very high leverage; the securities are sold to the public or to specialized funds with underlying collateral of uncertain value; and financial middlemen extract exorbitant returns at the expense of the real economy. This was the essence of the abuse of public utilities stock pyramids in the 1920s, where multi-layered holding companies allowed securities to be watered down, to the point where the real collateral was worth just a few cents on the dollar, and returns were diverted from operating companies and ratepayers. This only became exposed when the bubble burst. As Warren Buffett famously put it, you never know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out.<br />There is good evidence &#8211; and I will add to the record a paper on this subject by the Federal Reserve staff economists Dean Maki and Michael Palumbo &#8211; that even much of the boom of the late 1990s was built substantially on asset bubbles. [&#8220;Disentangling the Wealth Effect: a Cohort Analysis of Household Savings in the 1990s&#8221;]<br />A second parallel is what today <strong>we would call securitization of credit</strong>. Some people think this is a recent innovation, but in fact it was the core technique that made possible the dangerous practices of the 1920. Banks would originate and repackage highly speculative loans, market them as securities through their retail networks, using the prestigious brand name of the bank &#8211; e.g. Morgan or Chase &#8211; as a proxy for the soundness of the security. It was this practice, and the ensuing collapse when so much of the paper went bad, that led Congress to enact the Glass-Steagall Act, requiring bankers to decide either to be commercial banks &#8211; part of the monetary system, closely supervised and subject to reserve requirements, given deposit insurance, and access to the Fed&#8217;s discount window; or investment banks that were not government guaranteed, but that were soon subjected to an extensive disclosure regime under the SEC.<br />Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999, after more than a decade of de facto inroads, super-banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s &#8211; lending to speculators, packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way. And, much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s. Much of it isn&#8217;t paper at all, and the whole process is supercharged by computers and automated formulas. An independent source of instability is that while these credit derivatives are said to increase liquidity and serve as shock absorbers, in fact their bets are often in the same direction &#8211; assuming perpetually rising asset prices &#8211; so in a credit crisis they can act as net de-stabilizers.<br />A third parallel is the<strong> excessive use of leverage</strong>. In the 1920s, not only were there pervasive stock-watering schemes, but there was no limit on margin. If you thought the market was just going up forever, you could borrow most of the cost of your investment, via loans conveniently provided by your stockbroker. It worked well on the upside. When it didn&#8217;t work so well on the downside, Congress subsequently imposed margin limits. But anybody who knows anything about derivatives or hedge funds knows that margin limits are for little people. High rollers, with credit derivatives, can use leverage at ratios of ten to one, or a hundred to one, limited only by their self confidence and taste for risk. Private equity, which might be better named private debt, gets its astronomically high rate of return on equity capital, through the use of borrowed money. The equity is fairly small. As in the 1920s, the game continues only as long as asset prices continue to inflate; and all the leverage contributes to the asset inflation, conveniently creating higher priced collateral against which to borrow even more money.<br />The fourth parallel is the<strong> corruption of the gatekeepers</strong>. In the 1920s, the corrupted insiders were brokers running stock pools and bankers as purveyors of watered stock. 1990s, it was accountants, auditors and stock analysts, who were supposedly agents of investors, but who turned out to be confederates of corporate executives. You can give this an antiseptic academic term and call it a failure of agency, but a better phrase is conflicts of interest. In this decade, it remains to be seen whether the bond rating agencies were corrupted by conflicts of interest, or merely incompetent. The core structural conflict is that the rating agencies are paid by the firms that issue the bonds. Who gets the business &#8211; the rating agencies with tough standards or generous ones? Are ratings for sale? And what, really, is the technical basis for their ratings? All of this is opaque, and unregulated, and only now being investigated by Congress and the SEC.<br />Yet another parallel is the <strong>failure of regulation to keep up with financial innovation</strong> that is either far too risky to justify the benefit to the real economy, or just plain corrupt, or both. In the 1920s, many of these securities were utterly opaque. Ferdinand Pecora, in his 1939 memoirs describing the pyramid schemes of public utility holding companies, the most notorious of which was controlled by the Insull family, opined that the pyramid structure was not even fully understood by Mr. Insull. The same could be said of many of today&#8217;s derivatives on which technical traders make their fortunes.<br />By contrast, in the traditional banking system a bank examiner could look at a bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, see that loans were backed by collateral and verify that they were performing. If they were not, the bank was made to increase its reserves. Today&#8217;s examiner is not able to value a lot of the paper held by banks, and must rely on the banks&#8217; own models, which clearly failed to predict what happened in the case of sub-prime. The largest banking conglomerates are subjected to consolidated regulation, but the jurisdiction is fragmented, and at best the regulatory agencies can only make educated guesses about whether balance sheets are strong enough to withstand pressures when novel and exotic instruments create market conditions that cannot be anticipated by models.</p>
<p>A last parallel is ideological &#8211; the nearly universal conviction, 80 years ago and today, that <strong>markets are so perfectly self-regulating that government&#8217;s main job is to protect property rights, and otherwise just get out of the way.</strong></p>
<p>We all know the history. The regulatory reforms of the New Deal saved capitalism from its own self-cannibalizing instincts, and a <strong>reliable, transparent and regulated financial economy went on to anchor an unprecedented boom in the real economy</strong>. Financial markets were restored to their appropriate role as servants of the real economy, rather than masters. Financial regulation was pro-efficiency. I want to repeat that, because it is so utterly unfashionable, but it is well documented by economic history. Financial regulation was pro-efficiency. America&#8217;s squeaky clean, transparent, reliable financial markets were the envy of the world. They undergirded the entrepreneurship and dynamism in the rest of the economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What caught my eye is also what I have found in Adam Smith.<br />&#8220;Regulated, transparent, and reliable&#8221; markets.  Even if he met self-regulated, he was a moral philosopher as well.</p>

<p>In this Yahoo news article titled <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20071005/wl_mcclatchy/200/71005bcturkey_attn_national_foreign_editors_ytop">&#8220;Turkish envoy warns against U.S. genocide resolution&#8221;</a>, this stood out for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Justice Department records show that Turkey signed a $100,000 -a-month contract in May with the lobbying firm DLA Piper, one of several hired to fight the resolution.</p>
<p>Separately, Turkey paid Bob Livingston , former House Appropriations Committee chairman, $625,000 for work from March 1 to Aug. 31, records show. Last month, Turkey added the public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard to its roster at $113,000 a month. </p></blockquote>
<p>Republicans selling out the US to a fanatical Muslims is no new thing, but how is it that we can let other countries buy American foreign policy while being so blatant about it?</p>

<p>There was a “successful” Star Wars missile intercept on Friday Sep 29, where a “vehicle” launched from Alaska was “tracked” and “intercepted” by a star wars “missile” fired from California.  The “intercept” took place over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>James T. Hackett writes in the Oct 5 Washington Times that the success proves “critics” of star wars wrong.</p>
<p>He makes a few wild claims about star wars “working” then quotes Charles McQueary, DoD Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, that two flight test a year are just fine to justify continuing to spend billions to deploy unproven technology.</p>
<p>The tests are meaningless, extremely expensive, the vehicles are not reusable, they are all “successes” and they are not going to slow the flow of money, so two a year are just fine. </p>
<p>The system is not needed and will not work.</p>
<p>Hackett of Heritage Foundation, a group who has never seen a reason to stop spending money on unneeded and faulty weapons, claims the test to be useful and that the test was done using operational resources.  Here he presents a half hearted respect for the operating use of the weapons.  But his use is misleading.  There was nothing operational about the test.  It was highly scripted and would have been scrubbed had any issue arise during the “count downs”.</p>
<p>Star wars is going to have as much success getting an interceptor off on time as NASA has launching the shuttle.</p>
<p>The crews operating the weapons and surveillance were supposed to be operators, they were but they are the operators doing the laboratory tests and the implication that they are just like regular GI&#8217;s is misleading at best.</p>
<p>The workers setting the equipment up are highly skilled well paid contractor technicians, like those NASA uses to launch the shuttle.</p>
<p>Mc Queary, has a PhD in Engineering Mechanics and has been involved in the profit side of the military industrial complex for most of his working life.  He certainly understands the need to “accept risk” from too little testing to keep the checks flowing to the contractors.</p>
<p>The tests had nothing to do with proving the system is &#8216;worth the expenditure of the taxpayers&#8217; grandchildren&#8217;s scarce resources&#8217;.  OMB Circular A-109 requires test be continuously performed and results evaluated to assure the effective use of scarce resources. </p>
<p>This is what Mises recognizes; that the technology is driven by monopoly power and political influence.</p>
<p>Here is what is wrong with limiting tests:  In Apr 2000 the Osprey, MV-22 killed 22 marines, all GI marines, not scientists, because the test program did not do enough flight test to understand all the conditions the aircraft would confront.</p>
<p>Then in Dec 2000, another crash resulted from a flight issue where the software testing was too short to show fatal situations where the system “reacted” to the total loss of the airplane.</p>
<p>It is well and good for the insiders who make a lot of money and have no kids&#8217; lives depending on the system to say we can spend all that money and not worry about testing it properly.</p>
<p>I am beginning to like <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/007257.asp">Mises.org</a>.</p>
<p>This is titled “A World Without NASA&#8221;.</p>
<p>You could as easily put war machine, Homeland Insecurity, Dept of Energy or Transportation in there, as well possibly as HHS.</p>
<p>The linked article discusses opportunity costs from government control of science and technology similar to the arguments about opportunity losses due to the war machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to predict the opportunity costs that were foregone with the redistribution of billions of dollars confiscated from taxpayers. Not only did individuals have less money to invest in alternative methods of space-based aviation and research, but entrepreneurs had to compete against a well-financed monopoly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would highlight the idea of well financed monopoly.</p>
<p>The military industrial complex with all the vices of the monopoly is eating the trough of the nation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every so often a quote comes out of the Bush administration that leaves you asking: Am I crazy or are they? I had one of those moments last week when Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, was asked about a proposal by some Congressional Democrats to levy a surtax to pay for the Iraq war, and she responded, “We’ve always known that Democrats seem to revert to type, and they are willing to raise taxes on just about anything.” Yes, those silly Democrats. They’ll raise taxes for anything, even — get this — to pay for a war! And if we did raise taxes to pay for our war to bring a measure of democracy to the Arab world, “does anyone seriously believe that the Democrats are going to end these new taxes that they’re asking the American people to pay at a time when it’s not necessary to pay them?” added Ms. Perino. “I just think it’s completely fiscally irresponsible.”Friends, we are through the looking glass. It is now “fiscally irresponsible” to want to pay for a war with a tax. These democrats just don’t understand: the tooth fairy pays for wars. Of course she does — the tooth fairy leaves the money at the end of every month under Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson’s pillow. And what a big pillow it is! My God, what will the Democrats come up with next? Taxes to rebuild bridges or schools or high-speed rail or our lagging broadband networks? No, no, the tooth fairy covers all that. She borrows the money from China and leaves it under Paulson’s pillow. Of course, we can pay for the Iraq war without a tax increase. The question is, can we pay for it and be making the investments in infrastructure, science and education needed to propel our country into the 21st century? Visit Singapore, Japan, Korea, China or parts of Europe today and you’ll discover that the infrastructure in our country is not keeping pace with our peers’. We can pay for anything today if we want to stop investing in tomorrow. The president has already slashed the National Institutes of Health research funding the past two years. His 2008 budget wants us to cut money for vocational training, infrastructure and many student aid programs. Does the Bush team really believe that if we had a $1-a-gallon gasoline tax — which could reduce our dependence on Middle East oil dictators, and reduce payroll taxes for low-income workers, pay down the deficit and fund the development of renewable energy — we would be worse off as a country? Excuse me, Ms. Perino, but I wish Republicans would revert to type. I thought they were, well, conservatives — the kind of people who saved for rainy days, who invested in tomorrow for their kids, folks who didn’t believe in free lunches or free wars.</p></blockquote>
<p>With Tony Blow as press secretary, we could count on a daily dosage of stupidity and mendacity.  But Tony was neither as dumb nor as dishonest as Dana Perino.  Is the White House taking great joy in the fact that every time she opens her mouth, I think “what nuttiness is going to from out of this blonde bimbo’s mouth now”? A tip of the hat to Thomas Friedman for at least knowing that this stupid war means higher taxes for someone at sometime. Another hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/who-should-pay-.html">Mark Thoma</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Being forced to pay for a war I don&#8217;t support would tick me off, but that&#8217;s the point &#8211; by making the public fully internalize the cost of the nation&#8217;s decision to go to war (including the human cost), it will motivate more pressure to bring this war to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>I opposed this war too and likely voted for Bush-Cheney as many times as Mark did – zero.  But yes, we will have to pay for their incredibly stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  Could we at least be spared the free lunch idiocy of their minions like Dana Perino?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100500764.html">Cecilia Kang</a> plays Steno Sue with her <em>Strong Jobs Report Eases Fears Over Economy&#8217;s Health</em>.  Steno Cecilia listens to President Bush and just repeats his spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush said the jobs report pointed to a &#8220;vibrant and strong&#8221; economy, and he urged Congress to keep taxes low. In brief remarks from the Oval Office, he said he was mindful that some homeowners were worried about mortgage payments or the rising cost of college but added that with the revisions from August, &#8220;it means that we&#8217;ve had 49 consecutive months of job creation. And that&#8217;s the longest uninterrupted job growth on record for our country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=does_the_washington_post_work">Dean Baker</a> puts all of this in context:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article also allowed the Bush administration to do some unanswered boasting. Quoting the White House that the upward revision to the August data (from a loss to a gain) coupled with September&#8217;s jobs numbers &#8220;means that we&#8217;ve had 49 consecutive months of job creation. And that&#8217;s the longest uninterrupted job growth on record for our country.&#8221; While the statement is true, it is not terribly meaningful. Prior stretches of job creation were interrupted by short strikes. Since the White House is interested in records, the Post could have pointed out that the 0.64 percent annual rate of job growth since President Bush took office is also the slowest rate of job growth on record for any comparable period of time. </p></blockquote>
<p>Dean must be referring to the payroll survey which shows a cumulative increase of only 4.36% over the past 6.75 years.  The average growth rate has been anemic indeed.  OK, Lawrence Kudlow and his crew will likely scream household survey forgetting about this footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, January 2006, and January 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one ignores this footnote, employment growth would appear to be 6.28% over this period.  We might also notice that population has grown by 7.13%.  You see – the employment to population ratio fell from 64.4% as of December 2000 to 62.9% as of September 2007.  Simply put – employment has not grown as fast as the population regardless of how one measures it.  One would think a reporter working for the Washington Post to at least get the data right.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=does_the_washington_post_work#comment-4483872">Tim Worstall</a> offers this lame protest to what Dean said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think you may protest too much on this (no evidence, it&#8217;s just a feeling). From what I remember the unemployment rate at the start of the Clinton years was rather higher than it is now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crackers!  That old chestnut?  Yes Tim.  Clinton did inherit a 7.4% unemployment rate but he left a 3.9% unemployment rate.  Employment growth was strong enough during his eight years in office to dramatically lower the unemployment rate even as the labor force participation rate rose from 66.3% as of December 1992 to 67% as of December 2000.  In other words, the employment to population rate rose from 61.4% to 64.4%.  That’s some impressive job growth.  Now if you wish to see what happened to the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio since December, check our <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/september-employment-report.html">my graph</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/pathetic">Paul Krugman</a> weighs in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the whole of the Clinton administration, the economy added 22.7 million jobs – 237,000 per month. Over the whole of the Bush administration to date, the economy added only 5.8 million jobs – 72,000 per month. The Bushies like to pretend that history began in August 2003, so that they can ignore the job losses early in the administration. But even that doesn’t do the trick. Since August 2003, the economy has added 8.5 million jobs – 172,000 per month. So even by cherry-picking the good Bush years and pretending the bad years never happened, they still can’t match the average rate of job creation under Clinton. Now, you might say that Clinton doesn’t deserve all the credit for good things that happened on his watch – and I agree. But it’s the Bushies who are trying to spin a mediocre job record into proof that their policies are wonderful. Did I mention that the Clinton job boom followed an, um, increase in taxes?</p></blockquote>
