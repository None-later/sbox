<p>Can both be reporting true things? Yes.<br />Can both be offering a perspective that has some value? Yes<br />Can both be useful in our personal evaluation of the occupation? Partly.</p>
<p>Can both be unbiased in reporting&#8230;ahhh, now that is hard to answer. Since we all filter information a second before reading information, how does one avoid shooting oneself in the foot with &#8216;knowledge&#8217; filtered for our own persuasions (survival imperatives) and self-interest? Out of billions of bits of data, we tend to notice only a few at a time, one at a time.</p>
<p>Best not to talk to one&#8217;s own reflection all the time.</p>

                                <p>CoRev points to figures from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/">OIF</a> to show that the Surge is working.  Most of us have always hoped it would work, but have been skeptical it would.  And certainly, US casualties seem to be down in recent months &#8211; and figures for September are actually lower than for September of 2006.  So with luck, things are improving.</p>
<p>All that said&#8230;  what does an improvement mean?  Does it mean things are finally settling down?  And if so, are things settling down because the ethnic cleansing in most areas is more or less complete?  I believe somewhere upwards of a million people have fled to other countries, and another million or so have been displaced internally.    For a country with a population under 30 million, we&#8217;re talking about a huge percentage of the population.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what does success in the Surge or in the War in Iraq in general mean at the end?  Will the displaced be able to move back?  Will Iraq be a democratic society?  Will it be aligned with Iran?  Will most Iraqis identify America with peace and freedom, or with Blackwater?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/qwest-for-truth.html">Rdan</a> brought us the story from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202485.html?">Joseph Nacchio</a> et al. that the Bush Administration went forward with a warrantless surveillance program to gather information about Americans&#8217; phone records. Rdan considers two competing possibilities:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Efforts against terrorism were already underway before 9/11 and have come to light to bolster the Administration&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>2. The wiretapping is part of a different plan not yet revealed and was begun coincidentally with the terrorist threat as an extra incentive or cover.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the general lack of interest in Al Qaeda from the Bush team (recall Condi Rice called going after them “swatting flies”), #1 seems implausible.  But suppose I’m wrong.  <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/10/13/154228/96">Kagro X</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The domestic spying has always been justified by saying it was a necessary response to 9/11. But clearly there&#8217;s damned good reason to believe these programs were conceived and initiated well before the September 11th attacks. That would mean &#8211; gasp! &#8211; that your &#8220;government&#8221; is full of it. But it&#8217;s not just that. If Qwest&#8217;s competitors were already abetting this bloodless(?) coup before 9/11, then the &#8220;administration&#8217;s&#8221; domestic spying not only has little if anything to do with response to terrorism, but it also objectively failed to prevent 9/11.</p></blockquote>
<p>They secretly spied on us and they still couldn’t uncover this terrorist plot.  Now that is the height of in competency.  Remind me – why did we elect and then re-elect these clowns?</p>

                                <p>My series looking at a lot of different factors (from the economy to abortion) moved under Presidential administrations beginning with Ike has drawn a lot of criticism in private correspondence, comments on my posts, and even on the occasional post by other bloggers.   The problem, its seems, is that on most of these factors, the American public seems to fare better, on average, during Democratic Administrations than under Republican administrations.    That is not to say its been true on all series for all Democratic Administrations, but there does seem to be a difference &#8211; even now that I&#8217;ve for the most part stopped mentioning party affiliation at all (the Ex-GF suggested leaving it as the elephant in the living room, so to speak), simply putting up a graph that shows the performance of Presidents next to each other seems to be suggestive enough to be offensive or bad form. </p>
<p>So this post is about the criticism.  And I note I&#8217;ve had a lot of time to think about it&#8230; its been going on for a while, although in fairness, the criticism has evolved.  In the beginning, the criticism was that I had to be cherry-picking series (I started, as I recall, with real GDP per capita!) and that if I just went a bit wider, the discrepancy would disappear.  It didn&#8217;t.  Over time, the criticism evolved into a collection of excuses for the observed discrepancy.  Regular readers know I went through a whole series of posts looking at each of the excuses &#8211; Congress did it, its due to lags, Republicans inherit worse economies, the Fed did it, going back further (to FDR) kills it, Republicans simply get elected when the public senses times are about to get bad, the results don&#8217;t hold up using textbook statistical methods, etc.  None of the excuses held up.  But I checked &#8211; every single one of them.  This took a lot of time and effort.  There have been a few more minor evolutions, but as this series gets more and more complete, and as I begin trying to modify them (with a co-author who currently wishes to remain nameless) in order to put them in book form, the criticism has taken on a new form.  I want to focus on that new form.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s begin with an example &#8211; <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/home_sweet_home_equity.php">this post by Megan McArdle</a> is representative.  In particular,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cactus defends the notion that, once again, electing any president who is a Democrat has special, magical effects on desirable economic variables such as the amount of equity people have in their homes. The problem with this, as with most of Cactus&#8217; other demonstrations of amazing Democratic presidential economic power, is that it gives us an Underpants Gnome theory of economic good:</p>
<p>1) Elect anyone who is a Democrat to the office of president</p>
<p>2) ???</p>
<p>3) Awesome economy!</p></blockquote>
<p>(Apologies &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how to get blogger to put the gray background on the numbered items as she did it.)</p>
<p>Underpants Gnome theory of economic good&#8230;  To quote Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s character in Pulp Fiction, &#8220;Well, allow me to retort.&#8221;</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s a problem with the premise.  When did I ever pronounce the economy under Democratic administrations to be awesome?  My position &#8211; that Democrats are marginally less offensive than Republicans &#8211; has never been a secret.  Let me try an analogy&#8230;.   almost every morning, I go for a run &#8211; well, I jog for a while, and walk for a while.  I can&#8217;t jog too long or my knees will act up.  Other folks in the neighborhood jog too.  Now, anyone who observed the comings and goings in the neighborhood could probably figure out who they should bet on if we all participated in a 5K.  Pointing out that the lanky 28 year old who runs with a dog could beat the pants out of the rest of us who amble about in the morning is not the equivalent of saying he&#8217;s an awesome runner.</p>
<p>To extend the analogy&#8230; I think a couple of the administrations did some serious training&#8230;  JFK/LBJ brought in the technocrats, and Clinton was famous for the late night meetings in which policy details were hashed out and pizza was consumed.  But GW has a well-deserved reputation for being on vacation  &#8211; even when he&#8217;s not on vacation, when something happens we find out later he has to be informed later because he was out mountain biking at the time.  Ike had a reputation of being out to golf, and Reagan would be the vacation leader in a world where GW didn&#8217;t exist.  Contrast that with Carter, the (on most series) worst performing Democrat &#8211; he was derided as a micromanager who went so far as to determine who got to use the tennis court and when.   In general, Presidents from Party seem to have taken a hands-on approach, and Presidents from the other have publicly stated that government is the problem &#8211; when they weren&#8217;t trying to dismantle it, they were leaving it alone to run itself.  Returning to the running analogy &#8211; one group of weekend warriors tries to jog every morning, the other considers eating donuts Monday through Friday and some time spent on the golf course on the weekend to be adequate training for the LA Marathon.  And Megan McArdle thinks there&#8217;s something wrong with anyone would bet on the first group to do better, on average, than the second group.</p>
<p>So much for the awesome economy, but this may go some ways toward explaining the &#8220;2) ???&#8221; as well. </p>
<p>Which brings up another point&#8230; I&#8217;ve tried to explain the differences before.  As noted&#8230; I looked at every excuse and explanation for the difference that readers suggested, and tried to see if it fit the data.  I came up with ideas of my own &#8211; I noted that the change in real M2 per capita precedes the change in real GDP per capita, and the correlation between the two series is very, very high.  But even the Fed as an answer doesn&#8217;t work&#8230; the Fed&#8217;s policy toward Republicans (with the notable exception of its policy toward those named George Herbert Walker Bush) was more growth oriented than the Fed&#8217;s policy toward Democratic administrations.   So what is left?  Policy?  Luck?  Anything else?</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#8217;m fudging the data. In my posts, I link directly to the data&#8230; I believe in all but one of them, my source for the data was the government agency most closely associated with that particular set of data.  I make it quite easy to check, and to call me on fudged data.  And every so often, a reader points out a mistake, and I put up a correction.  But its happening less, fortunately &#8211; as I&#8217;ve automated the process, its harder to screw up.  </p>
<p>I could go on, but I want to cover one more thing&#8230;  even if I made no attempt to explain the difference, I think the series has value.  I think there is some value in simply understanding what is going on, even if one doesn&#8217;t know why.  One can&#8217;t come up with an adequate theory if one is simply way wrong about what happened.   Getting the facts more or less right is important to coming up with a useful theory to explain them.  Perhaps simply compiling the facts and organizing them into a visual, easy to understand way would be enough (assuming that really was all that I was trying to do). </p>
<p>But I want to come back to where I started, and to turn it around.  In the end, I think the problem is with the results.  I think the Megan McArdles of this world wouldn&#8217;t have much of a problem if all these series showed a random mix of Presidents, or showed the Republicans coming out on top.  They are looking for confirmation of their beliefs, of that theory that sprang into existence and moves through the world completely untouched by facts &#8211; that government really doesn&#8217;t matter except to drag down the economy, or at least, that those who talk up small government are the ones who govern best.  And there is intense frustration at seeing their views not only not confirmed, but also contradicted.</p>
<p>So as (apparently) the leading proponent of the &#8220;Underpants Gnome theory of economic good&#8221; &#8211; I want to at least point out that, even as Megan McArdle defines it, that theory makes more sense than following <a href="http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/csb/laws/science.htm">Maier&#8217;s Law</a>.</p>

                                <p>Several months ago I predicted a water war in the next decade.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of Americans have or are migrating to the southern and western states,<br />where there are many areas of chronic water shortages (duh).</p>
<p>Now Governor Bill Richardson has fired the first shot, suggesting a national water policy, which is shorthand for stealing water from the Great Lakes. Rustbelters are outraged, some suggesting we sell Richardson water at $80.00 a barrel.</p>
<p>Vegas, probably the fastest growing area in the country, is sucking as much from the Colorado as it can, and will still have major shortages, perhaps within months.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes are in a low cycle and any diversion would probably be an ecological disaster.</p>
<p>Beyond that,  should those in the midwest pay for the bad judgments of many other citizens and public officials?</p>
<p>(Most of the Democrats are refusing to set foot in Michigan because it has an early primary, and ignoring Ohio because of a late primary. Maybe they can get water from New Hampshire.)</p>
<p>Individuals and businesses are welcome to move back to the Great Lakes area, where there is plenty of water, plenty of electricity and inexpensive housing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Remember, no coerced interrogation, civilian lawyers in courts for captured overseas terrorists, no branding the Iranian guards terrorists, and no phone surveillance without a specific warrant.</p></blockquote>
<p>His statement brought to mind this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>A person will worship something, have no doubt about that. We may think our tribute is paid in secret in the dark recesses of our hearts, but it will out. That which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives, and our character. Therefore, it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are<br />worshipping we are becoming.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202485_2.html?hpid=topnews">CEO Nacchio of Qwest</a> has a write up in WAPO:</p>
<blockquote><p>A former Qwest Communications International executive, appealing a conviction for insider trading, has alleged that the government withdrew opportunities for contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars after Qwest refused to participate in an unidentified National Security Agency program that the company thought might be illegal.</p>
<p>Former chief executive Joseph P. Nacchio, convicted in April of 19 counts of insider trading, said the NSA approached Qwest more than six months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to court documents unsealed in Denver this week.<br />Details about the alleged NSA program have been redacted.<br />&#8230;<br />The newly released court documents say that, on Feb. 27, 2001, Nacchio and James Payne, then Qwest&#8217;s senior vice president of government systems, met with NSA officials at Fort Meade, expecting to discuss &#8220;Groundbreaker,&#8221; a project to outsource the NSA&#8217;s non-mission-critical systems.</p>
<p>The men came out of the meeting &#8220;with optimism about the prospect for 2001 revenue from NSA,&#8221; according to an April 9, 2007, court filing by Nacchio&#8217;s lawyers that was disclosed this week.</p>
<p>But the filing also claims that Nacchio &#8220;refused&#8221; to participate in some unidentified program or activity because it was possibly illegal and that the NSA later &#8220;expressed disappointment&#8221; about Qwest&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nacchio said it was a legal issue and that they could not do something that their general counsel told them not to do. . . . Nacchio projected that he might do it if they could find a way to do it legally,&#8221; the filing said.</p>
<p>Mike German, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the documents show &#8220;that there is more to this story about the government&#8217;s relationship with the telecoms than what the administration has admitted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s inappropriate for the government to be awarding a contract conditioned upon an agreement to an illegal program. That truly is what&#8217;s going on here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foundation has sued AT&#038;T, charging that it violated privacy laws by cooperating with the government&#8217;s warrantless surveillance program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking about the issue raises several possiblities for me if reasonably true:</p>
<p>1. Efforts against terrorism were already underway before 9/11 and have come to light to bolster the Administration&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>2. The wiretapping is part of a different plan not yet revealed and was begun coincidentally with the terrorist threat as an extra incentive or cover.</p>
<p>3. It takes a crook to catch a crook.</p>
<p>4. Secret programs can be coercion, collusion, or a way to gain market share without the opportunity costs normally associated with new programs.</p>

                                <p>Expect the liberal bloggers to tell you about <a href="http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&#038;article=49460">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The former top commander of U.S. troops in Iraq slammed the handling of the war and gave a bleak assessment of the current situation in Iraq.  “There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight,” retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez told a convention of military journalists on Friday. Sanchez commanded U.S. troops in Iraq from June 2003 to July 2004. His controversial tenure saw the capture of Saddam Hussein and the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi government, but also the rise of the insurgency and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.</p></blockquote>
<p>General Sanchez also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/washington/12cnd-general.html?hp">said</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>“There was been a glaring and unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders,” he said, adding later in his remarks that civilian officials have been “derelict in their duties” and guilty of a “lust for power.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – General Sanchez has the courage to tell us the truth.  OK, we all know what he says is true.  But would you be willing to put up with what we know will be the GOP slime machine attacking this man who was brave enough to serve in Iraq and also brave enough to tell the truth?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, I first heard this on CNN where a little sliming had already crept in.  No – I do not want to see what Faux News is going to do to this patriot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/055867.php">Steve Benen</a> points to <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20070923-9999-1n23generals.html">Mark Sauer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The generals acted independently, coming in their own ways to the agonizing decision to defy military tradition and publicly criticize the Bush administration over its conduct of the war in Iraq.   What might be called The Revolt of the Generals has rarely happened in the nation&#8217;s history.  In op-ed pieces, interviews and TV ads, more than 20 retired U.S. generals have broken ranks with the culture of salute and keep it in the family. Instead, they are criticizing the commander in chief and other top civilian leaders who led the nation into what the generals believe is a misbegotten and tragic war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve wonders if RUSH will tag these generals to be <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200709270010">phony soldiers</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>But the Associated press and the Obama campaign have seized on that, and characterized it as something of a flip flop, because Hillary Clinton criticized Barack Obama earlier this year when in a debate he said that he would meet in the first year of his presidency with a whole host of foreign despots, including Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro, and Ahmadinejad of Iran, and that he&#8217;d do so without conditions. Well, they claimed that Hillary Clinton suddenly embraced that position, but in truth she did not. Where Mr. Obama was talking about meeting with leaders in the first year of his administration, Hillary Clinton yesterday was talking about negotiations with Iran the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazing!  I guess AP was shamed and decided to report this <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5izJr4wFXhrXfr8mlCBthgtCZvMcwD8S7EU6O0">accurately</a> after all. While Holly Ramer’s story says 17 hours ago – check the links from 2 hours ago.</p>
