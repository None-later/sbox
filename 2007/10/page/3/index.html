<p>I was catching up on some blog reading and saw something interesting from <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/china/5/15/">Brad Setser</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a tendency to equate the RMB/ dollar with the RMB.   That most often shows up in tendency to equate an appreciation of the RMB against the dollar with an appreciation of the RMB.   That is a mistake.   If the dollar is depreciating against other currencies, the RMB can appreciate against the dollar and still depreciate against most of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad proposes the following currency measure:</p>
<blockquote><p>The following chart &#8211; which was inspired by a suggestion from former Treasury Secretary Summers &#8211; shows moves in the RMB against a  40% dollar/ 40% euro (used as a proxy for all European currencies) and a 20% yen basket.   That roughly matches the current composition of China’s trade with the G-3 once adjustments are made to account for the large share of China&#8217;s trade that goes through Hong Kong.   </p></blockquote>
<p>His G-3 basket is indexed such that June 2005 = 100. Brad’s chart shows some noise in his G-3 series but there has been almost no net change from June 2005 to September 2007.  We show the components by graphing how many yuan a dollar will buy, how many yuan the yen will buy, and how many yuans the Euro will buy – all indexed such that June 2005 = 100.  While the dollar has weakened by about 9 percent and the yen has weakened by about 14 percent, the value of the Euro with respect to the yuan has gone up by over 14 percent.  The value of the G-3 basket has therefore declined by less than one percent.  Brad compares the value of the yuan to a couple of other currencies as well.</p>

<p>The towns of Braintree, Hull, and others have declared water emergencies for use of water in the home (not the silly emergencies around lawn watering), declaring that they have only a three month supply in their resevoirs. Notice on the map our drought conditions in MA are only D-3 overall (severe).</p>
<p>Notice the Lakes area, and the Southwest as well of course the Southeast as advertized nationally. California fires have overshadowed the more important long range issue of drought for agriculture and hydrological crisis.</p>
<p>There have been posts on water, but mainly from city folk. Any farm or ranch people out there as well?</p>

And I note that other than the prescription for Vicodin (I never had that or any other mind-altering drug prescribed as far as I can remember), I could in all honesty state everything he&#8217;s stated.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Three things that I hope to see happen before I&#8217;m gone.</p>
<p>1. Unencumbered travel to Cuba.<br />2. Universal health care<br />3. Legalizing medical marijuana</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t drink, I&#8217;ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, I don&#8217;t take anything stronger than Sudafed. I&#8217;ve even had times when I have been prescribed Vicodin and I still don&#8217;t use it because it makes me feel stupid(er). And, no, you can&#8217;t have it, so don&#8217;t ask. But there may come a day when I will want something that will ease my pain without side-effects before I take that stroll down oblivion way.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Predicting the future is not very hard, according to Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: a little mathematics is all you need. Figuring out how to manipulate a situation to achieve specific aims is a bit less straightforward, but Bueno de Mesquita says his mathematical tools can usually do that, too.</p>
<p>The New York University political science professor has developed a computerized game theory model that predicts the future of many business and political negotiations and also figures out ways to influence the outcome. Two independent evaluations, one by academics and one by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, have both shown that about 90 percent of his predictions have been accurate. Most recently, he has used his mathematical tools to offer approaches for handling the growing nuclear crisis with Iran.</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The elements of the model are players standing in for the real-life people who influence a negotiation or decision. At each round of the game, players make proposals to one or more of the other players and reject or accept proposals made to them. Through this process, the players learn about one another and adapt their future proposals accordingly. Each player incurs a small cost for making a proposal. Once the accepted proposals are good enough that no player is willing to go to the trouble to make another proposal, the game ends. The accepted proposals are the predicted outcome.</p>
<p>To accommodate the vagaries of human nature, the players are cursed with divided souls. Although all the players want to get their own preferred policies adopted, they also want personal glory. Some players are policy-wonks who care only a little about glory, while others resemble egomaniacs for whom policies are secondary. Only the players themselves know how much they care about each of those goals. An important aspect of the negotiation process is that by seeing which proposals are accepted or rejected, players are able to figure out more about how much other players care about getting their preferred policy or getting the glory. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of his most famous past predictions also concerned Iran. In 1984, the model predicted that when Ayatollah Khomeini died, an ayatollah named Hojatolislam Khameini and a little-known cleric named Hasheimi Rafsanjani would rise to succeed Khomeini as leaders of Iran. At the time, most experts considered that outcome exceedingly unlikely, since Khomeini had designated a different person as his successor. But in fact, when Khomeini died five years later, Rafsanjani and Khameini succeeded him.</p>
<p>Bueno de Mesquita says he also predicted that Andropov would succeed Brezhnev long before experts considered it likely. He foresaw that China would reclaim Hong Kong 12 years before it happened, and he predicted that France would narrowly pass the European Union&#8217;s Maastricht Treaty. </p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming this guy is for real (i.e., that his prediction can be verified&#8230;  also, how good those predictions were (I&#8217;m not sure how unlikely betting on Andropov was even five years before Brezhnev died, since at that time he was heading the KGB, and he managed to amass so much information the rest of the Politburo wanted him booted up&#8230; now, I&#8217;m no Sovietologist, but had he picked Chernenko to succeed Andropov a year before it happened&#8230;)) I&#8217;d love to see his tool.</p>

<p>But why do we have bases in Germany?  And why do we have bases in South Korea?  Twenty years ago maybe it made sense, but now?  And what exactly will be the purpose of US forces in Iraq in 60 years?</p>

                                <p>Via (for the second time today!) the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13384.html">Carpetbagger Report</a>, an article in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602417.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The State Department will order as many as 50 U.S. diplomats to take posts in Iraq next year because of expected shortfalls in filling openings there, the first such large-scale forced assignment since the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>On Monday, 200 to 300 employees will be notified of their selection as &#8220;prime candidates&#8221; for 50 open positions in Iraq, said Harry K. Thomas, director general of the Foreign Service. Some are expected to respond by volunteering, he said. However, if an insufficient number volunteers by Nov. 12, a department panel will determine which ones will be ordered to report to the Baghdad embassy next summer. </p>
<p>&#8220;If people say they want to go to Iraq, we will take them,&#8221; Thomas said in an interview. But &#8220;we have to move now, because we can&#8217;t hold up the process.&#8221; Those on the list were selected by factors including grade, specialty and language skill, as well as &#8220;people who have not had a recent hardship tour,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fools.  Don&#8217;t they know the Surge is working?  And now a reference that tells us, this ain&#8217;t no Vietnam:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although a few skilled individuals were ordered to &#8220;hard-to-fill&#8221; diplomatic posts in past decades, there have been no mass &#8220;directed assignments&#8221; in the Foreign Service since 1969, when an entire class of 15 to 20 entry-level officers was sent to Vietnam, Thomas said.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who are ordered to Baghdad as part of the new call-up will receive incentives, known as the Iraq Service Package, already offered to volunteers. It includes additional pay of about 70 percent for most mid-level officers, plus another 20 percent of basic salary to compensate for long hours. Officers are not allowed to take their families to Baghdad, but the package allows them to leave spouses and children in whatever post they transfer from for the length of their tour, or to send them back to Washington.</p>
<p>U.S. diplomats in Baghdad are given five &#8220;rest and relaxation&#8221; breaks during the year, including up to three of them in the United States, for a total of 60 days outside Iraq. Those completing a Baghdad tour are also given preference in choosing their next assignment. </p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with the State Department?  Why aren&#8217;t spouses and children allowed?  Don&#8217;t they know the Surge is working?  And 60 days outside of the country out of 365?  One day in six?  You&#8217;d think the folks with information about what is actually going on think that things aren&#8217;t going so well in Iraq.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A while back, I noted that the killings in Iraq would stop once the ethnic (or rather, sectarian) cleansing was complete.  </p>
<p>So how do you tell the difference between a strategy is working (i.e., right now, The Surge, but at this time next year, something else) and cleansing that has been completed?  Because right now, in some parts of Iraq, there is quiet.  Well, relative quiet.  And some attribute it to the Surge.</p>
<p>I think the answer is obvious.  You can tell a neighborhood has been pacified as a result of the policy du jour rather than cleansing if the folks who moved away (i.e., fled) move back.  I believe estimates are that well over a million people have fled the country, and about that many are internally displaced.  Whatever the precise number, in a country of under we&#8217;re talking about, at a minimum, a figure equal to 5% of the country&#8217;s current population (which the CIA factbook estimates at about 27.5 million).  Most of those who fled aren&#8217;t exactly living in luxury &#8211; a huge percentage are living illegally or on the fringes in Jordan or Syria.  All of which is to say, there are a lot of Iraqis who would be ready and willing to move back, if the country was pacified, and pacified by virtue of something other than their absence.</p>
<p>Which brings us to, via the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13379.html">Carpetbagger Report</a>, a story in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602402.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When we first got here, all the shops were open. There were women and children walking out on the street,&#8221; Alarcon said this week. &#8220;The women were in Western clothing. It was our favorite street to go down because of all the hot chicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was 14 long months ago, when the soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, arrived in southwestern Baghdad. It was before their partners in the Iraqi National Police became their enemies and before Shiite militiamen, aligned with the police, attempted to exterminate a neighborhood of middle-class Sunni families. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>While top U.S. commanders say the statistics of violence have registered a steep drop in Baghdad and elsewhere, the soldiers&#8217; experience in Sadiyah shows that numbers alone do not describe the sense of aborted normalcy &#8212; the fear, the disrupted lives &#8212; that still hangs over the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>American soldiers estimate that since violence intensified this year, half of the families in Sadiyah have fled, leaving approximately 100,000 people.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a slow, somewhat government-supported sectarian cleansing,&#8221; said Maj. Eric Timmerman, the battalion&#8217;s operations officer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The descent of Sadiyah followed a now-familiar pattern in Baghdad. In response to suicide bombings blamed on Sunni insurgent groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq, the Shiite militias, particularly the Mahdi Army, went from house to house killing and intimidating Sunni families.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The focus of the battalion’s efforts in Sadiyah was to develop the Iraqi security forces into an organized, fair and proficient force — but the American soldiers soon realized this goal was unattainable. The sectarian warfare in Sadiyah was helped along by the Wolf Brigade, a predominantly Shiite unit of the Iraqi National Police that tolerated, and at times encouraged, Mahdi Army attacks against Sunnis, according to U.S. soldiers and residents. The soldiers endured repeated bombings of their convoys within view of police checkpoints. During their time here, they have arrested 70 members of the national police for collaboration in such attacks and other crimes.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry, which oversees the national police, has said that officials are working hard to root out militiamen from the force and denied that officers have any intention of participating in sectarian violence.</p>
<p>But in one instance about two months ago, the American soldiers heard that the Wolf Brigade planned to help resettle more than 100 Shiite families in abandoned houses in the neighborhood. When platoon leader Lt. Brian Bifulco arrived on the scene, he noticed that “abandoned houses to them meant houses that had Sunnis in them.”</p>
<p>“What we later found out is they weren’t really moving anyone in, it was a cover for the INP to go in and evict what Sunni families were left there,” recalled Bifulco, 23, a West Point graduate from Huntsville, Ala. “We showed up, and there were a bunch of Sunni families just wandering around the streets with their bags, taking up refuge in a couple Sunni mosques in the area.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were so committed to them as a partner we couldn&#8217;t see it for what it was. In retrospect, I&#8217;ve got to think it was a coordinated effort,&#8221; Timmerman said. &#8220;To this day, I don&#8217;t think we truly understand how infiltrated or complicit the national police are&#8221; with the militias.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The American people don&#8217;t fully realize what&#8217;s going on, said Staff Sgt. Richard McClary, 27, a section leader from Buffalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just know back there what the higher-ups here tell them. But the higher-ups don&#8217;t go anywhere, and actually they only go to the safe places, places with a little bit of gunfire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t ever [expletive] see what we see on the ground.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the corollary to that last quote is the folks on the ground don&#8217;t see the big picture.   But in this case, the big picture is easy to see:  much of the country has been cleansed, and the populations have been separated.  And the folks who have fled are not coming back.</p>
<p>Why is American blood and treasure not going to help those who have had to flee, but rather those that have made them flee?  At what point do we conclude, or do we even care, that American blood and treasure is going toward helping those that have done the cleansing, and is, in fact, helping them keep the place cleansed?</p>

I thought I would post some information on the variety of approaches to these subjects about people and<br /><a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html">personality traits</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study of personality includes multiple approaches to the question of who we are and how and why we are similar and different to other indivduals. Some of the ways in which we study personality are developing <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-taxonomies.html">descriptive taxonomies</a> of individual differences. These approaches use basic <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-measurement.html">psychometric and assessment</a> techniques developed for the study of personality and <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-iq.html">ability</a>. These approaches emphasize the &#8220;who&#8221; question of how people are similar to and yet differ from each other.<br />At least five different theoretical approaches address the &#8220;why&#8221; question. That is, why are there individual differences. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#EvolPsych">Evolutionary Psychology</a> emphasizes universals of human behavior and attempts to explain individual variability in terms of alternative adaptive strategies. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Behavior">Behavior genetic</a> approaches analyze the variation in behavior in terms of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Systematic work in <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Biological">biological theorizing</a> has emphasized the continuity of behavior across species and searches for the biological underpinnings of temperament and complex behavior. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#social">Social cognitive</a> theories emphasize the importance of socialization and the effect of cognitive processes to create one&#8217;s unique patterning of behavior. Traditional <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Psychoanalytic">psychoanalytic techniques</a>, although not a major area of current personality theory, did have an influence in the theories developed throughout much of the 20th century.<br />The following selections from each of these approaches are meant to lead the interested reader to some of the current literature. These are certainly not meant to be a complete selection, but are rather important readings that provide good overviews of the separate approaches. The interested reader is encouraged to first consult the <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-overviews.html">overviews of personality</a> before delving into these more specialized readings.<br />Some of the most interesting results of the past decade have been the demonstrations of the moderate to strong heritability of personality and ability. Using techniques of quantititative behavior genetics, it has become commonplace to show that roughly 40-60% of the variation in most personality traits have a genetic base. The most exciting and counter-intuitive findings have been that the shared environment is much less important than previously thought but that the unique environment is very important.</p>

                                <p>David Shuster did a fine job last night guest hosting for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21490510">Countdown</a>, while Keith Olbermann visited Fenway Park for Game 2 of the World Series.  Here is the part that interested me the most:</p>
<blockquote><p>SHUSTER:  In Greek myth, Cassandra was the prophet whose warnings were to be cursed never to be heeded until it was too late.  In presidential politics, Rudy Giuliani has become the prophet whose warnings he has cursed never to have issued until it was too late.  On the campaign trail he talks about his terrorism scholarship before 9/11 and says only he saw the real danger posed by al Qaeda.  But in our fourth story in the COUNTDOWN: A secret document which you were never meant to say until after November 2008 has now been leaked refuting Giuliani‘s claim with his own words.  Typical displaying a foresight was a presidential campaign speech to summer which he discussed in 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It was a big mistake to not recognize that it was a terrorist act and an act of war, and then we were attacked at Cobart Towers, Kenya, Tanzania, 17 of our sailors killed on the USS COLE and the United States government under then President Clinton, didn‘t respond.  Bin Laden declared war on us, we didn‘t hear it.  I thought it was pretty clear at the time, but a lot of people didn‘t see it, couldn‘t see it.<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>SHUSTER:  Never mind that al Qaeda‘s culpability for the COLE was only established after Mr. Bush‘s election and Mr. Bush then did nothing about it.  Now, in New York, “The Village Voice Newspaper” reports that in the testimony before the 9/11 Commission on count after count, Giuliani revealed little knowledge of or positive dispositions influenced by the threat of al Qaeda.  According to one commission memo it was after 9/11 that quote &#8211; “We brought in people to brief us on al Qaeda.  We had nothing like this pre-9/11 which was a mistake.”  And Giuliani, on police commissioner told the commission &#8211; “I was not happy with NYPD‘s intelligence in general,” when he took the job at 2000, seven years after the first bombing.  Other items from the commission, Giuliani said Commissioner Ferric (ph) knows more than he does about software that might help in the war on terror and Giuliani had “No knowledge” of the amplifier system installed after the 1993 bombing to improve communications.  Let‘s bring in the reporter who broke the story, Wayne Barrett, of the “Village Voice,” author of “Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani in 9/11” and probably the source of more Giuliani reporting than anyone else, Wayne, thanks for your time tonight.</p>
<p>WAYNE BARRETT, VILLAGE VOICE: David, glad to be here.</p>
<p>SHUSTER:  Wayne, give us the broad outline of the degree of terrorism expertise Giuliani claimed in his secret testimony to the 9/11 commission.</p>
<p>BARRETT:  Zero, David, it was a confession of ignorance.  He basically said, I knew nothing about al Qaeda.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barrett and Shuster continue but you get the idea.  When Rudy says the Clinton White House was not listening – that’s a flat out lie.  They were listening and acting on the information they had.  When Rudy says he was listening, it seems this also was a lie.  But hey – this kind of dishonest Democrat bashing is Rudy’s entire campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Guess it’s no surprise that <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/10/fox_news_tells.php">Faux News</a> supports Rudy!</p>
