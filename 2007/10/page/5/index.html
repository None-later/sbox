                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Through the miracle of the intertubes, lately, when I&#8217;ve been making my breakfast, I&#8217;ve been listening to news from a radio station in Rio.  (I don&#8217;t know what they play when I&#8217;m not making breakfast, but the stream is <a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/cbn/wma/radiorj/wma.asp">here</a>.)  Anyway, its been raining heavily in Rio&#8230; and landslides have shut down a tunnel on the main artery connecting the &#8220;south&#8221; half of the city with the &#8220;north&#8221; half. </p>
<p>Each day, I learn exactly where the problems are, and what it means.  Today, in a fifteen minute stretch, there was a nice, in depth discussion about how its going to affect stores in shopping centers.  There was also an interview with a soil engineer.  I learned something from both interviews&#8230;  and not just about Rio.  And along the way, I learned precisely what to avoid if I was in Rio and was headed to work or wherever. </p>
<p>I contrasted that with my experience fiddling with the radio trying to figure out what was going on the other day when I was at my Mom&#8217;s house and we were trying to decide whether to evacuate.  The sky was black, we knew there were fires on two sides of us, but that&#8217;s about it. And the tv and the radio would only tell us about Malibu, because, well, Malibu is the only place that matters around here. </p>
<p>And unrelated to fires and rains, I realized I don&#8217;t even listen to American radio any more.  Quite simply&#8230; I haven&#8217;t found any stations where I learn anything.  And I don&#8217;t watch the news either, plus I really don&#8217;t think CNN &#8211; the version we get here in the US at least &#8211;  holds a candle to just about any station&#8217;s evening news show in Brazil or Argentina.  </p>
<p>Am I wrong about this?  And if not, why does American news suck?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/03/AR2007090300933.html?nav=emailpage">The Washington Post reports:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued a flier to combat myths about the flu vaccine. It recited various commonly held views and labeled them either &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false.&#8221; Among those identified as false were statements such as &#8220;The side effects are worse than the flu&#8221; and &#8220;Only older people need flu vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>When University of Michigan social psychologist Norbert Schwarz had volunteers read the CDC flier, however, he found that within 30 minutes, older people misremembered 28 percent of the false statements as true. Three days later, they remembered 40 percent of the myths as factual.</p>
<p>Younger people did better at first, but three days later they made as many errors as older people did after 30 minutes. Most troubling was that people of all ages now felt that the source of their false beliefs was the respected CDC.</p>
<p>The psychological insights yielded by the research, which has been confirmed in a number of peer-reviewed laboratory experiments, have broad implications for public policy. The conventional response to myths and urban legends is to counter bad information with accurate information. But the new psychological studies show that denials and clarifications, for all their intuitive appeal, can paradoxically contribute to the resiliency of popular myths.</p>
<p>This phenomenon may help explain why large numbers of Americans incorrectly think that Saddam Hussein was directly involved in planning the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and that most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were Iraqi. While these beliefs likely arose because Bush administration officials have repeatedly tried to connect Iraq with Sept. 11, the experiments suggest that intelligence reports and other efforts to debunk this account may in fact help keep it alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not much to add at the moment, running late. Something to keep in mind, and  truth cuts three ways most of the time.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Someone from country Xyz can immigrate to our country if they bring a couple million bucks and agree to start a business that employees fifty or more. &#8212;  Implies that such an immigrant adds to the economy, doesn’t it?  No doubt, dropping the couple million into an economy would have an effect, but starting a business that competes with an existing isn’t going to help much; might even be a negative.  Say your invitee started a business and employed illegals to make a product that an existing business employing natives was making, and competed in the same market – probably a net loss for your country, no?  Even if the invitee uses native labor to make a product that was already being made domestically, there’s no net gain to the Nation’s economy unless the invitee’s product either addresses a new domestic market, or is exported.</p>
<p>What’s America’s actual, for real, net from globalization/free trade?  On the plus side, billions and billions, maybe trillions, increased return to investors, and oodles of cheap stuff at Wal-Mart.  But, there are negatives. Suppose, for example, that more than thirty million American workers saw their wages or salaries fall behind an average of six thousand dollars per year for the past ten years?   That’s $1.8 trillion.  And, suppose, for example, that crime increased due to the reduced living standard for an additional cost to the Nation of, say, $200 billion over the ten years?</p>
<p>Where the plant stood, a plant that once &#8211; long time ago in 1980 &#8211; employed a thousand workers, now squats a better than nothing self-storage for storing all the stuff people buy that they don’t need, worth maybe $10 million.  When it was operating and profitable, the plant was a sizable asset, worth say one-half $billion.  Long since relocated to China, it’s off the Nation’s books, so the jobs.  One-thousand jobs averaging say $30 k/year over ten years represent a loss of $300 million; plus the $490 million asset loss; multiply the two by the tens of thousands of plants lost and you’re talking tens of billions of more dollars lost to the economy. </p>
<p>Wall Street loves McDonalds.  Pays dividends, provides cheap eats, and so it must be good.  What about the rest of America?   Is America better off without the waitress/waiter making union wages?  What’s the net?   Recall the fastfoodies’ hand wringing over an increase in minimum wage?  “We’re providing entry-level jobs”, they said, i.e., they were training the Nation’s youth to be good future employees.  Appears they meant the nations of Mexico and Guatemala.  Ah, but we still have choices in restaurants; McDonald’s, Burger King, Jack-in-the Box, Taco Bell, … and either Chinese or Mexican.  Again, what’s the net if a Chinese, or Mexican restaurant opens and runs the local coffee shop out of business? </p>
<p>In some cities, trains and buses always served the Airport.  Now, BART and Muni-Busses serve SFO direct.  But they didn’t for some fifty years.  Oh it wasn’t that people didn’t want such service – getting to and from SFO was a big pain, but, you see; there was this hand full of parking lot owners, jitney operators, limo-services, taxi companies, … who, ever election cycle, greased the palms of local politicians and reminded them of the extended voting families that were dependent on the status quo.  My point? The hiring of illegals in SF, too, is based on what’s best for the few vs. what’s good for the community.  While, some Chinese illegals are working off indenture, and the Mexicans, Guatemalans, … are in a race to the bottom for wages, native San Franciscan laborers, painters, gardeners, roofers, waiters/waitresses, … are out of luck.  And, ‘tis so because a few restaurants, hotels, … are greasing politicos palms while reminding them of the large Latin/Asian vote.</p>
<p>As I recall, John Kenneth Galbraith thought that a nation’s economy should serve the Nation’s populace.  If I’m right about this, he got it right.</p>
<p>Am I placing too much blame on trade and immigration?  Yes.  The problem of resources was always there, and is huge.  And, it would have been better if the Nation had had the time to adjust to automation alone and before globalization struck. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/the-cost-of-the.html">Mark Thoma</a> brings us the latest estimate from the CBO.  I just read the USA Today coverage of this and Dean Baker would be happy to know that this paper translated the $2.4 trillion into $8000 per person.  Of course, Bill Kristol estimated the cost of this war to be only $20 billion back in late 2002.  Off by a factor of 120 isn’t that bad – is it?  But Bill might also remind us of all those benefits from this war.  Let’s start a list:</p>
<p>(1) The invasion of Iraq has made Iran the big battle one on the block.  More excuses for Dick Cheney’s next war.</p>
<p>(2) The invasion of Iraq has revived Al Qaeda.  More excuses for Republicans to attack Democrats as if we don’t care about the looming terrorist threat.</p>
<p>(3) The lead-up to this invasion led to a 2002 GOP victory and the actual invasion led to the reelection of Bush-Cheney in 2004.  OK, there was little setback in 2006, but notice how the GOP candidates on renewing their spin that only Republicans can save us from another 9/11 by more wars in the Middle East?  For these guys, the Iraq War seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure our readers can provide more “benefits” in the same manner so have fun.</p>

<p>Follow-up.</p>
<p>Now take three two year old boys, each of whose parents died in an accident, and each of whom is brought up by a foster family.  The first inherits a sum of $20,000 payable on his 25th birthday.  The second inherits a sum of $100,000 on his 25th birthday.  The third inherits $1,000,000 on his 25th birthday.</p>
<p>Which of these individuals is most likely to be making $20,000 a year fifteen years later?  Which is most likely to be making $100,000 a year?  And which is most likely to be making $1,000,000 a year fifteen years later?</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman Podhoretz believes that America needs to go to war soon with Iran. As far as he knows, Rudy Giuliani thinks the same thing. “I was asked to come in and give him a briefing on the war, World War IV,” said Mr. Podhoretz, a founding father of neoconservatism and leading foreign policy adviser to Mr. Giuliani. “As far as I can tell there is very little difference in how he sees the war and how I see it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg has more on this neocon insanity.  But I must be missing something.  Last time I checked, we had World War I and World War II.  So what happened to World War III?  Or maybe Rudy knows that Dick Cheney still has another 15 months in office and there’s something else in the works.  How did we elect and then re-elect these idiots?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.earthtalk.org/">Earth Talk</a> suggests a boring alternative to running headlong into &#8220;green&#8221; sales.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear EarthTalk: Short of buying a new hybrid or other “green” car, are there ways I can make my existing vehicle more eco-friendly? I bought my car recently and am not quite ready to give it up. </p>
<p>Choice of vehicle may well be the biggest factor in determining the environmental impact of your automobile-based travels. But a considerable amount of energy is used—and pollutants emitted—in the production of any new vehicle, including hybrids and other more fuel-efficient options. As a result, many environmentalists believe that practicing good driving habits and performing adequate maintenance on an older car are probably better options for the environment than causing the production of a new vehicle. </p>
<p>According to the website GreenerCars.org, there are many ways to green up one’s driving habits. Obeying speed limits, utilizing cruise control and avoiding jackrabbit starts will maximize fuel economy and minimize tailpipe emissions while also preventing unnecessary wear-and-tear. Staying off roads during rush hours is also advisable, as stop-and-go driving burns excess gasoline and promotes smog. Opening vents and windows to cool off instead of using the air conditioner, an inherently inefficient appliance that consumes more fuel and leads to more emissions, is also good advice. </p>
<p>Drivers can also help minimize their environmental impact by keeping their cars well maintained. According to GreenerCars.org, getting regular tune-ups—where a qualified mechanic changes fluids and checks for and corrects problems such as worn spark plugs, under inflated tires, dragging brakes, misaligned wheels and clogged filters—can significantly improve fuel economy and minimize harmful emissions. GreenerCars.org also recommends seeking out low-rolling-resistance (LRR) replacement tires, which are specifically designed to improve a vehicle’s fuel economy, when the original ones wear out.</p></blockquote>
<p>How would an entrepreneur sell this idea and make it sexier?  And how would one make money from it?</p>

                                <p>This concept of Comparative Advantage hits a big wall if we accept the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank&#8217;s study </a>on what generates wealth.</p>
<p>If comparative advantage is about what comes natural to a given nation, it has to include what the study referred to as natural capital. This is only 40% of the wealth generation for a poor nation but drops to 20% for a rich nation and is 5% overall world wide. Produced capital accounts for only 18% world wide.</p>
<p>77% of wealth creation is from “intangible capital”. Intangible capital is the results of societies efforts to improve it&#8217;s self as a society (making us better people). It is legal, it is education. It is civil rights, it is (or was here) free education to including college, it is management of our environment, it is (or was) the enlightenment, it is adaptation of knowledge for the betterment of living life. None of these things are the results of nature. They are the results of will and money. The money being spread for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>So, we look at China or India and see that they have taken steps to improve their society via education and legal. The comparative advantage however is still more in the natural capital. What is their “natural” capital? It is low relative wages as compared to the rich nations. Is there any naturally comparative advantage? I think not. It&#8217;s not like they are selling us natural resources. What they are selling are the results of moving the know how and productivity generating tools (using a hammer drill to drill a hole in concrete vs a star drill and hammer) to their countries. Their natural capital is in their labor.</p>
<p>This creates a dilemma for the free traders who think it is only a matter of stuff and things in exchange for currency. If 40% of poor nations wealth generation is natural capital, and produced capital is 18% of the wealth generation, then that leaves 42% of China&#8217;s wealth generation intangible. This is competing against us with numbers that most likely look closer to the world overall, 5% natural, 18% produced, 77% intangible. Being that our advantage is our society, and our society was created by creating a better distribution of wealth, then how are NAFTA, CAFTA etc. without emphasis on labor, rights, and environment promoting our comparative advantage?</p>
<p>This dilemma of promoting trade agreements on only the 2 tangible sectors of the 3 sectors that drive wealth creation ignoring that a rich country as moved vastly beyond the ratio of the 3 sectors to where investment in ones society is the dominating sector by far, is what is wrong with applying models that discuss comparative advantage as some kind of sliding scale based on only the tangibles. Wine vs wool was it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re loosing the trade wars as a nation because we&#8217;re writing trading agreements to our partners advantage. That&#8217;s what comes of letting people who only think about business, do the trade agreements. They only think in terms of the natural capital and created capital. It is why the models are wrong when they say there will be or has to be “losers”. Bull crappy on that.</p>

Kevin focused on one aspect where the mayor overstepped his authority and just stiffed audits of how City Hall spent money.  Kevin summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Choosing the best presidential candidate among the 2008 contenders is a tough job. Picking the worst is easy. Rudy Giuliani is the guy you&#8217;d get if you put George Bush and Dick Cheney into a wine press and squeezed out their pure combined essence: unbounded arrogance and self-righteousness, a chip on his shoulder the size of a redwood, a studied contempt for anybody&#8217;s opinion but his own, a vindictive streak a mile wide, and a devotion to secrecy and executive power unmatched in presidential history. He is a disaster waiting to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this is an economist blog – right?  Well, this excerpt is about fiscal policy.  Isn’t Rudy also a member of the Cheney free lunch wing of the supply-side silly school?  If you think the Bush-Cheney fiscal policy is great – Rudy is your candidate.</p>

                                <p>Reader Howard Covitz sends a link to <a href="http://www.oculture.com/2007/10/our_ancestral_mind_in_the_modern_world_an_interview_with_satoshi_kanazawa.html">an interview with Satoshi Kanazawa</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure I agree with everything he says in the interview, but this is fascinating.  And in my opinion, worth pondering.</p>
<blockquote><p>DC: Evolutionary psychology portrays us as having impulses that took form long ago, in a very pre-modern context (say, 10,000 years ago), and now these impulses are sometimes rather ill-adapted to our contemporary world. For example, in a food-scarce environment, we became programmed to eat whenever we can; now, with food abounding in many parts of the world, this impulse creates the conditions for an obesity epidemic. Given that our world will likely continue changing at a rapid pace, are we doomed to have our impulses constantly playing catch up with our environment, and does that potentially doom us as a species?</p>
<p>SK: In fact, we’re not playing catch up; we’re stuck. For any evolutionary change to take place, the environment has to remain more or less constant for many generations, so that evolution can select the traits that are adaptive and eliminate those that are not. When the environment undergoes rapid change within the space of a generation or two, as it has been for the last couple of millennia, if not more, then evolution can’t happen because nature can’t determine which traits to select and which to eliminate. So they remain at a standstill. Our brain (and the rest of our body) are essentially frozen in time — stuck in the Stone Age.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few random thoughts:<br />1.  Perhaps evolution selects for ability to adapt, or even luck?<br />2.  Perhaps not everything is changing in unpredictable ways.  For example, the need for the ability to use tools, in battle and otherwise, has been a constant for several millenia now.  (The cost of this improvement, in terms of food that has to be consumed, may be high though.)  Similarly, I can&#8217;t think of a single environment in which humans have been in for which being able to see or resist disease better has not been an advantage.  (I presume that the &#8220;cost&#8221; to the body of such adaptations (i.e., the amount of food consumed to maintain such improvements) is minimal.)</p>
<p>Your thoughts.</p>
