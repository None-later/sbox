                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Oil, Credit, Global Warming (with pollution)&#8211;all coming together for the perfect storm.</p>
<p>Oil hopefuls still dream of oil returning to $45/barrel. The $90/barrel (and rising) they say is nothing more than a geopolitical event: Turkey and the Kurds, Bush and Iran, Israel-Leiberman/Syria.</p>
<p>But supplies are growing tight. The spigot may soon not meet the demand. China, after all, has the pedal to the metal. Nothing will deter it from its goal of being a frontier nation. And then there is India. Actual world oil production—even with the increase in rigs—seems to have flattened. Of course Congress will blame it all on those greedy oil companies.</p>
<p>The credit crunch is starting to hit the U.S. consumer&#8211;, he whose spendthrift ways gave the “oomph “ to the party. Subprime carnage continues. We never know where the next head of this hydra will appear. And, of course, the dollar falls. Cheapening the dollar makes some debts easier to pay: All those countries that bought T-Bills, etc. For the U.S. consumer, though, it will be a nightmare. Cancel the trips abroad. Worry about the oil bill. And wait for the price of those cheap imports to rise.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t expect our manufacturing plants, resource centers, and research facilities now happily sitting in developing countries to return home. Labor is still cheaper there; tax breaks are still better. At some point, of course, freight costs are going to be passed on. But in the interim, profit margins will lessen. At what point will freight costs outweigh labor costs and tax benefits? Many of our imported goods have very high profit margins: Lots of shrinkage possible, assuming the world supply of well-heeled buyers does not decline too much.</p>
<p>Global warming? Well, one interesting statistic is worth mentioning: The recent Arctic ice-melt is thirty years ahead of the IPCC schedule. The IPCC claimed that sometime in 2040 we would reach the present Arctic sea ice melt. Mother Nature has her own schedule, apparently. Meanwhile some areas predicted to experience more and more extreme drought conditions are starting to get a glimmer of what that might mean. CNN used the time it had assigned to its special “Planet in Peril” to cover the fires in California.</p>
<p>Those who claim that these fires—and the serious water shortages we are now experiencing—are because of poor planning and over-population—have a good point. We have not planned well. On the other hand, the ice-melt proceeds apace. I wonder if Greenland has some surprises for us. If the IPCC missed the ice-melt by thirty years, what else have they missed?</p>
<p>For me, global warming is never just about balmier days and sweaty nights—more sun tan oil and drilling in Arctic waters. There is the pollution that simply grows and grows. Every time I think of China, I just despair. Yes, we in the West have done poorly. We have nothing to brag about. But China is so much bigger. In following our footsteps, it will sink the entire planet. And China had the chance of doing it differently, of learning from out mistakes, of growing intelligently. Now it is a runaway machine…out of control of its own planners. When Wuxi decided that its pollution could not longer be tolerated, other Chinese cities stepped forward. “Send the factories here,” they said. We would rather be rich and polluted than poor and clean. The phrase “filthy rich” now has a new twist, I think. But maybe it always had that twist. We never stopped to notice.</p>
<p>We will certainly stumble on for another five or six years, but the stumbling will get worse. Movie Guy often told me, “2012, that’s my year for the shit hitting the fan.” He may be right.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell people now in their 30’s or 40’s what they have missed…or how our environment has dramatically worsened. They simply live with it, not knowing anything else. Water and air and land become increasingly polluted. It’s all they know. So it gets a bit worse each year; hey, that’s progress. But I remember laughing about bottled water. “You got to be kidding! Bottled water! &#8221;  I drank out of lakes and streams or pumped water out of a well.</p>
<p>All places are microcosms of what is happening. I have three or four about which I regularly think. Yes, I see the documentaries about the rest of the planet, but in the last analysis, my own experience is just as informative.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1950’s on Cape Cod: Farms, small towns, lakes filled with fish always attracting a crowd of swimmers. And the lakes were potable. Now, few lakes are swimmable. Salt water coves and inlets were pollution free.. Now, the coves and inlets often are polluted. The farms are gone, replaced with wall-to-wall traffic. The houses are still beautiful, but the thirst for water is threatening the water table. As the aquifers disappear, the salt water encroaches. Red tide, rarely a problem when I was young, is now a serious problem. Areas once always opened for clamming and shell fishing are now more often than not closed. Progress? I guess. Sensible planning? No. Those that live there now think it a great place. I would never live there.</p>
<p>As a young man, I lived in Westchester, NY. In the 60’s and 70’s it was quite rural. Air was clean, plenty of walking space. Traffic, while at times difficult, was not the nightmare it has become. Smog and pollutants once reserved for New York City have now spread to northward. Clean air? I don’t think so. Power plants are alive and spewing throughout New York. Suck an exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>I used to swim in Long Island Sound, if you can believe it. But before I left, I had to stop. The filth was unbelievable.</p>
<p>My experience has to be multiplied a million times over. No place is as pristine as it was in the 1950’s. Occasionally we make inroads; but they are temporary.</p>
<p>The last place I lived before moving to Canada was the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The Chesapeake Bay within living memory was once clean. Billions of oysters filtered the water. You could see ten or fifteen feet down. Now, you might see a foot into its cloudy depths. Large areas are anaerobic; blue crabs struggle to the surface for air. Oysters are almost gone; the blue crab is on its way. Close friends of mine were waterman; they made a living crabbing and tonging. One by one they have left the bay; one by one they have moved off the shore. Crab picking houses now have to import crabs to keep busy. Talk about &#8220;Saving the Bay&#8221; is always present, always ineffectual. The pressures are too great; the ignorance too pervasive.</p>
<p>Once a waterman asked me to help him with his trotline. I happily obliged. When we took a break for a beer and refreshments, he blithely tossed the garbage overboard: beer cans, plastic…everything. “Oh,” he responded to my alarm, “don’t worry. Crabs eat everything.” Beer cans? Plastic holders? There was no arguing with him. Another waterman friend schemed as to how he could increase the number of his crab pots. Increase them he did. A few years later, he could no longer make a living crabbing or tonging. He left. Happily some rich dude from Washington bought his house: It had a great view of the Bay. The rich dude liked the idea of living among the watermen.</p>
<p>Conservation simply does not make sense to those who want more, from large corporations to single individuals. Each sees his livelihood in very short terms: today, tomorrow, may a few months or a year at most. We should not be surprised.</p>
<p>But the perfect storm is approaching. It is of our own creation: A monument to our success and creativity, to our science and ingenuity. We can scrape the ocean floors faster; drill deeper and better wells. Put air filters in our homes; buy bottled water. I don&#8217;t think the market is working. Slowly but surely we are being driven into a corner. Take the long view and you will see what I mean.</p>

                                <p>This is just a little visual fun. Think about that saying “a billion here, a billion there, soon you&#8217;re talking about<a href="http://www.xinjo.com/interesting/a-little-visual-perspective-on-the-87-billion-being-spent-on-iraq?eref=rss_full"> real money</a>”.</p>
<p>Personally, I think visuals like this need to be circulated more frequently so that people have a better understanding when the government or business speaks dollar amounts. It might help them pause about whether they think something such as a war is really getting them a better life.  Or just how much of a relative tax break they are getting.</p>
<p>But for the war, we&#8217;re talking trillions so:<br />Here is some perspective on TRILLION:<br />Trillion = 1,000,000,000,000.The country has not existed for a trillion seconds.Western civilization has not been around a trillion seconds.One trillion seconds ago – 31,688 years – Neanderthals stalked the plains of Europe.</p>
<p>Here is another one I like: <a href="http://www.lcurve.org/">The L Curve</a></p>
<p>Last but not least is this one that is actually a presentation being made to our legislators concerning our military budget.<br /><a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/oreos/">The Oreo Cookie </a></p>

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ll lookie lookie.  It appears some white supremacists love them some Ron Paul.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, it seems the White Supremacist crowd has decided that Ron Paul is the lesser of various evils (from their perspective) and is willing to support him.  That, for Curt at Flopping Aces, is a good enough reason not to support Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Now, I think regular readers can figure out that the probability that I would vote for Ron Paul for anything approaches zero.  But I think Curt is holding a very inconsistent position&#8230; I wonder which of the two major candidates Curt thinks the White Supremacist crowd preferred in the last Presidential election, or the one before that, or the one before that, and so forth, at least going back to when FDR ran for the first time.  If he&#8217;s exercised that White Supremacists look at Ron Paul as the lesser of various evils running for the Republican nomination, will he be equally opposed to Giuliani or (in my opinion, more likely) Romney when it turns out the White Supremacists look at the Republican candidate as the lesser of two evils in the general election?</p>

                                <p>Earlier this week Econlog and Marginal Revolution had a good discussion about an article by<br /><a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/07-09/wages.cfm">Terry J. Fitzgerald</a> in the Minneapolis Fed Review.</p>
<p>The article goes into a great deal of detail about the weak performance of average hourly earnings in recent years.</p>
<p>One point in the discussion was the new experimental measure of average hourly earnings being developed by the BLS.  This measure has been getting a lot of attention lately with the widespread expectations that the new measure would show that the old measure of average hourly earnings has been significantly understating the rate of gain for average hourly earnings.</p>
<p>We now have some 16 months of results from the new experimental measure of average hourly earnings. it shows.</p>

<p>In the first year the new measure grew 3.3% while the old measure expanded 4.0% and over the first 16 months the old measure of average hourly earnings grew 5.4% as compared to a 4.3% increase for the new experimental measure.</p>
<p>So far it looks like the new experimental measure is demonstrating just the opposite results that what was expected by those who believe that average hourly earnings has been significantly understating the income growth of the about 80% of employment that punch a time clock rather than earn a salary or commission or are self employed.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2007/10/29/071029on_onlineonly_surowiecki?currentPage=1">Tyler Cowen</a>, a link to a nice article on the Laffer Curve by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2007/10/29/071029on_onlineonly_surowiecki?currentPage=1">by James Surowiecki</a>.  Surowiecki notes that despite the facts and evidence, the current President, the current Vice President, and everyone vying to be the Republican nominee have all declared that cutting taxes raises revenues:</p>
<blockquote><p>This supply-side orthodoxy is striking in a couple of ways. First, it requires Republican politicians to commit themselves publicly to a position that is wrong—and wrong not as a matter of ideology or faith but as a matter of fact. Saying today that tax cuts will increase tax revenues is not like saying that bombing Iran constitutes a sensible foreign policy, or that education vouchers will wreck the public schools. It’s more like saying that the best way to treat sick people is to bleed them to let out the evil spirits. Second, despite the fact that the supply-side faith has no grounding in reality, within the Republican Party there is little room for dissent on the subject&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>And its a widespread belief.  But the danger of being able to believe in things that contradict the facts is not limited to that mistaken belief.  Someone who can avoid the facts in one area can avoid the facts in others.  And will.</p>
<p>Consider other widespread beliefs among the Republican faithful&#8230;  Republicans are the Party of Economic Growth. Or Republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered all of these topics here at Angry Bear&#8230; in fact, regular readers know I&#8217;ve beaten both those topics to death, with a graphical summary of the results <a rhef="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>.  For those in a do-it yourself mood, wander over to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">OMB Table 7.1</a>.  The last four Republican Presidential administrations &#8211; GW, GHW, Reagan, and Ford &#8211; have each increased the Federal debt held by the public (as a percentage of GDP).  In some cases (cough, Reagan, cough) by quite a bit.  By contrast, the last Democratic Party President to do so was FDR, and he was fighting WW2.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to the comment at <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/10/its-about-packaging.html">Betsy&#8217;s Page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats just can&#8217;t believe that sometimes, people actually like Republican ideas but must just be fooled by a deceptive message.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what happens if Republican ideas are a load of BS?  BS that sounds very good, and very appealing.  BS supported by &#8220;experts&#8221; &#8211; Harvard Professors, Business School Deans, etc. &#8211;  who provide assurance that yes, it really is true, there really is a free lunch.  </p>
<p>Who bears the blame, then, for the fact that &#8220;people actually like Republican ideas&#8221;?  To some extent, the suckers who fall for it.  But most people are busy, and don&#8217;t have time to pay attention to everything.  So they must rely on the experts.  Which means&#8230; those who have the time and wherewithal to check the facts, but instead continue selling snake oil are to blame.  The experts, but also the bloggers and reporters and editors who hide from the facts and repeat things they have to at least suspect is BS, or they&#8217;d be checking the data themselves.  And as a result, they&#8217;re to blame for a debt that is higher than it should be, for economic growth that is slower than it should be, and for the lives lost due to the lack of innovation that has resulted.</p>

David Hunt at (insert the Imperial March, aka Darth Vader&#8217;s theme) <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304306,00.html">Fox News</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Besides, these things are of little consequence when you realize how we missed, squandered, screwed up, made a mess of and were massively risk adverse — again — when we did not kill Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan just two short months ago.</p>
<p>We know, with a 70 percent level of certainty — which is huge in the world of intelligence — that in August of 2007, bin Laden was in a convoy headed south from Tora Bora. We had his butt, on camera, on satellite. We were listening to his conversations. We had the world’s best hunters/killers — Seal Team 6 — nearby. We had the world class Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) coordinating with the CIA and other agencies. We had unmanned drones overhead with missiles on their wings; we had the best Air Force on the planet, begging to drop one on the terrorist. We had him in our sights; we had done it. Nice job again guys — now, pull the damn trigger.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, and in my opinion, criminally, we did not kill Usama bin Laden.</p>
<p>You cannot make this crap up; truth is always stranger and more telling than fiction. Our government, the current administration and yes, our military leaders included, failed to kill bin Laden for no other reason than incompetence.</p>
<p>The current “boneheads” in charge will tell you all day long that we are fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan to stop terrorists there so they do not come here. Nice talk, how about — just for a moment — acting like you mean what you say? You know walk the walk. These incidents, where we displayed a total lack of guts, like the one in August, are just too prevalent. The United States of America’s political and military leadership has, on at least three separate occasions, chosen not capture or kill bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri. We have allowed Pakistan to become a safe haven for Al Qaeda. We have allowed Al Qaeda to reconstitute, partially because of money they (Al Qaeda in Iraq) have been sending to Al Qaeda in Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear the details of this one.  If this isn&#8217;t just another example of someone on Fox News making up nonsense (but why make something up that makes GW look bad &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t they be putting the blame on Hillary?), my guess is that nobody was around to give the go-ahead.  GW was probably out mountain biking in the habitat of some endangered species, and Dick Cheney was in a secure location, listening in on someone&#8217;s phone conversations.  Since the Dark Lord strikes me as the kind of guy who isn&#8217;t big on his underlings taking matters into their own hands, with both he and GW out of the loop nothing can happen.  </p>
<p>Remember back in 2004 when they told us you shouldn&#8217;t change horses in the middle of a stream?  I wonder if the folks who bought that argument ever considered that the horse&#8217;s tendency to roll over onto its back in deep water wasn&#8217;t going to go away.</p>
<p>&#8212;-  </p>
<p>I think this story dovetails nicely with Dan&#8217;s post about Fox, Al Qaeda, and the fires CA.</p>

<blockquote><p>Transcript:<br />DOOCY: You’re looking live at pictures from San Diego — Santiago, CA, where the wildfires continue. We were talking earlier in today’s telecast with Adam Housley and apparently police officers in a hovering helicopter saw a guy starting one of these fires. And Allison Allison Camerota, an FBI memo from late in June of this year is popping up this morning and it is ominous.</p>
<p>CAMEROTA: This actually has happened for many years in the past as well. An FBI sent out to local law-enforcement said that an al Qaeda detainee had given them some information that the next wave of terrorism could be in the form of setting wild fires. Adam Housley said lots of people on his block were asking him about it. Obviously this is something the FBI has looked into. They will continue to investigate it.</p>
<p>CARLSON: If they have this person in custody it probably won’t take long to be able to develop a link if there is one.</p>
<p>KILMEADE: A June 25 memo from the FBI’s Denver offices reported three days ago, excuse me, five days ago, by the Arizona Republic, that is a newspaper, they have been carrying the story and they continue to expand upon it.</p>
<p>DOOCY: Brian, the plot they say, according to this detainee, and they don’t know if the detainee is telling the truth. The plot was to set three or four wildfires. But they don’t mention California. They mention Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. We do know for a fact that a number of the fires in southern California are of a suspicious nature and they are investigating arson.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet no one thought I could connect the two!</p>
<p>Actually, whether right or wrong, smart creative terrorists could cause havoc when required. Name some weak points not in the news. The tunnel collision linking N and S California highway systems. Computers in Utah funneling airport traffic data to coordinate national air traffic. Others?</p>

<blockquote><p>House Republicans are fuming over Democrats&#8217; decision to hold the next vote on the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program on Thursday &#8211; when many Republicans will be in California as President Bush tours areas hit by wildfires … At a meeting of Republican House members to discuss the revised bill, Rep. Louis Gohmert of Texas said the Democrats are &#8220;taking advantage of a disaster to loot the American treasury.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Look – John Boehner is not the Speaker.  Nancy Pelosi is.  And as the Republicans used to be fond of saying – elections have consequences.  Incidentally, my state is predominantly Democratic and as Stacey Bernards (spokesperson for Steny Hoyer) noted: “The fires aren’t partisan”.  Boehner and his ilk are on the losing side of this issue.  Their feigned anger at the timing of this vote is simply childish.  Too bad the minority leader in the House never grew up.</p>

<blockquote><p>Orders for American-made durable goods unexpectedly fell, led by a slump in military equipment that overshadowed increases in business investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But could there be a silver lining?</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for cars, planes and other items made to last several years fell 1.7 percent in September, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. At the same time, orders for and sales of computers and machinery, a proxy for capital spending, advanced. “Manufacturing will have slow-but-steady growth through the end of the year,” said Adam York, an economist in Charlotte, North Carolina, at Wachovia Corp., which had forecast orders would decline in September. The drop in total orders was “not quite as weak as the headline suggests.”  Record export demand will keep manufacturing growing, helping prevent the housing-market recession from sinking the broader economy, economists said. The gains in business investment prompted Morgan Stanley and Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a St. Louis-based research group, to lift their estimates of third-quarter growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the drop in Federal defense purchases might soon be matched by increases in business investment and exports.  In other words, a rise in national savings that allows for a reverse crowding-out effect where the sum investment and net exports increase by the same amount? One can only hope!</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been listening to the citizens of southern California pledging to rebuild their homes, again in the midst of fire and mudslide danger zones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the risks to my homes, and the potential risks come out like this:</p>
<p>thunderstorm<br />(wind and hail)                  5%<br />sewer backup                     1%<br />blizzard                           .05%<br />flood                                .01%<br />home fire                        .01%<br />tornado                           .001%<br />hurricane                        .001%<br />earthquake                   .0001%<br />wildfire                         .0001%</p>
<p>These are not scientific numbers but I think are a good reflection of my risk profile.</p>
<p>I understand that insurance involves sharing risks, and that some have higher risks and other have lower risks.</p>
<p>However&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>At some point I&#8217;m not certain I want to share risks with people who build expensive homes in fire zones or build expensive homes on exposed beaches in hurricane areas.</p>
<p>California has too many people in places where there are high risks and a shortage of water. This is a result of 30 years of non-existant public policies on sprawl and internal migration.</p>
<p>So who pays?</p>
