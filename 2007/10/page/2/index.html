<blockquote><p>So Giuliani&#8217;s case for the superiority of our &#8220;free market&#8221; health care system goes something like this: While on health insurance provided by New York state, he was treated, using a surgery developed by Europeans, for prostate cancer, a disease that most commonly afflicts those covered by the federal government&#8217;s single-payer health care system. Take that, Europe/national health insurance.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=NGFjNzU4OGMwOGJlYTgyNmY3ZDJiM2YzOTFhNzBkNjE=">Thomas Sowell at the National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is remarkable how many political “solutions” today are dealing with problems created by previous political “solutions.” Three examples that come to mind immediately are the housing -market crisis, the wildfires in southern California, and the water shortages in the west.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, where housing prices are the highest in the nation, risky interest-only loans went from being 11 percent of all new mortgages in 2002 to being 66 percent of all new mortgages in 2005.</p>
<p>Study after study has shown that housing prices are highest where government restrictions on building are the most severe. That is the ugly result of pretty words like “open space.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Sowell has a point.  See, I lived in the Bay Area for a while.  Part of the reason people find it to be desirable place to live, part of the reason pay a lot of money to live there, is because it has the open spaces and the facilities.  I would think the magic of the free market &#8211; the prices people are willing to pay to live in San Francisco &#8211; would tell Sowell something about the value people place on these open spaces.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Why would people risk building million-dollar homes in the known paths of wildfires? For the same reason that people choose to live in the known paths of hurricanes. Because the government — that is, the taxpayers — will get stuck with a lot of the costs of dealing with those dangers and the costs of rebuilding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, and why do consider building in areas with tornadoes, or prone to floods, or where blizzards might shut the place down for a week, or where there are droughts, or where you might end up in contact with animals that have rabies, or where there are gang members?  All of these situations end up having &#8220;government solutions&#8221;.  But guess what&#8230; that&#8217;s everywhere in the US.  There is no idyllic place we&#8217;d all move to if only the government didn&#8217;t encourage us to make stupid decisions.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say the government doesn&#8217;t make a lot of problems.  It certainly does.  The Housing bubble was spurred on by Greenspan&#8217;s massive rate cuts, which were intended to do something about getting the economy moving again that GW tax cutting policy wasn&#8217;t doing in 2001 and 2002 and 2003.  And of course, Sowell would never mention the National Debt, caused by cutting taxes and simultaneously spending massive amounts of money &#8211;  a combination known as a Reagan.</p>

                                <p>India, China, Russia, and Turkey have been warned off dealing with Iran, especially concerning oil deals and infrastucture. But Iraq is making deals right and left. I have not updated the Turkey/Kurdistan situation from last week because it has a fast changing life of its own.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070811/wl_mideast_afp/iraniraqeconomyoil">Iraq and Iran</a> signed an agreement to build pipelines for the transfer of Iraqi crude oil and oil products, the state-run Iran news network Saturday quoted the oil ministry as announcing.The 32-inch (81-centimetre) pipeline will bring crude from the southern Iraqi port of Basra to the southwestern Iranian port of Abadan. There will be a separately 16-inch one for oil products.</p>
<p>Iran and China to build a pair of enormous power plants, the Iraqi electricity minister said Tuesday. Word of the project prompted serious concerns among American military officials, who fear that Iranian commercial investments can mask military activities at a time of heightened tension with Iran. (I lost the link on this)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/">Renewal of UN mandate and Oil agreement</a> is in jeopardy as part of some bargaining chip and soveriegnty issue.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The oil game in Iraq may be almost up. On September 29th, like a landlord serving notice, the government of Iraq announced that the next annual renewal of the United Nations Security Council mandate for a multinational force in Iraq &#8212; the only legal basis for a continuation of the American occupation &#8212; will be the last. That was, it seems, the first shoe to fall. The second may be an announcement terminating the little-noticed, but crucial companion Security Council mandate governing the disposition of Iraq&#8217;s oil revenues.</p>
<p>By December 31, 2008, according to Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, the government of Iraq intends to have replaced the existing mandate for a multinational security force with a conventional bilateral security agreement with the United States, an agreement of the sort that Washington has with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries in the Middle East. The Security Council has always paired the annual renewal of its mandate for the multinational force with the renewal of a second mandate for the management of Iraqi oil revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071021/wl_afp/turkeykurdsunrest_071021161800">Turkey and Iran</a> have a common problem:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Faced with rising rebel violence, Turkey says it is running out of options other than military action, with neither the United States nor Iraq doing enough to stamp out the rebel bases.<br />More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK took up arms fighting for self-rule in Turkey&#8217;s mainly Kurdish southeast.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Cactus had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/tbogg-on-medical-marijuana-and-other.html">post</a> that advocated freer use of marijuana.</p>
<p>Here is another <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/">site</a> that agrees.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most people conclude that marijuana carries no special analgesic relief that cannot be addressed by other pharmaceuticals. The FDA did studies decades ago that support that conclusion, but some scientists assert that the studies had flaws which rendered them unreliable. The government refuses to do more studies despite the anecdotal evidence of exceptional pain relief in some circumstances &#8212; and despite the billions of dollars spent keeping marijuana illegal.</p>
<p>At some point, we have to do an honest cost-benefit analysis for criminalizing marijuana. We jail tens of thousands of people and create legal burdens for hundreds of thousands more every year for using or selling a weed that grows almost everywhere. It puts an equal burden on law enforcement, courts, and the penal system. In exchange, we get a dubious effect on usage for a drug that has the same addictive and intoxicating effects as alcohol.</p>
<p>Some will argue that marijuana serves as a gateway drug to more destructive substances, and that much is true. Many things act as gateways to harder drug use: abuse, poverty, boredom, and peer pressure, and especially alcohol, which is almost always a gateway to marijuana. Prohibition didn&#8217;t do much about that gateway drug, and decades of marijuana prohibition isn&#8217;t doing much for that one either &#8212; and marijuana might at least have a claim to be medicinal.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/27/AR2007102701241.html">Chris Cillizza and Shailagh Murray</a> write without further comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the radio spot, Giuliani mentions his battle with prostate cancer and notes that his chances of surviving the disease in America were 82 percent, while in England his chances would have been 44 percent.  &#8220;You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors, not with a government bureaucrat,&#8221; Giuliani says in the ad. </p></blockquote>
<p>By the same token – a French man has a 100% chance of surviving breast cancer.  Kevin Drum notes that Rudy is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012380.php">full of shit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you can see from the chart on the right, Britain and the United States have virtually identical mortality rates from prostate cancer. The only reason the U.S. has a higher survival rate is because we diagnose way more prostate cancer than Britain in the first place. In other words, the difference probably isn&#8217;t that we&#8217;re any better at prostate cancer surgery than the Brits, but that we aggressively screen for even mild cases of prostate cancer that probably aren&#8217;t life-threatening in the first place &#8211; and then, unsurprisingly, we go on to survive all these non-threatening cancers regardless of treatment. So not only is Giuliani&#8217;s statistic bogus, but it might actually reflect poorly on U.S. practices. British mortality rates from prostate cancer are just as good as ours, and they manage this without wasting time, money, and emotional distress on overdiagnosis or overtreatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Click on Kevin’s chart and you are directed to an <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/i_wonk_because_.html">Ezra Klein</a> takedown of Cato’s <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/02/depends-on-what-the-meaning-of-universal-is/">Michael Cannon</a> &#8211; the latter claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>For prostate cancer, you are twice as likely to die of it in Germany as in the U.S. (44 percent vs. 19 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezra consults with Cannon’s source and summarizes thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why does Germany have less than half our prostate cancer incidence?  And does it mean that their cancers are more serious, less curable cases?  It&#8217;s unclear.  But the bottom line is that you&#8217;re no more likely to die of prostate cancer in Germany than the US, and you&#8217;re also less likely to die of other things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that Ezra posted his comments back on <strong>May 2, 2006</strong>.  One would think Chris Cillizza And Shailagh Murray could do a little fact checking before repeating Rudy’s BS as if it were gospel.  Look – Rudy has lied about a lot of things during his campaign.  And he keeps doing this because he knows he can.  Sort of like the reason Dick Cheney lies on Meet the Press.  Dick knows Tim Russert is not going to call him on his serial dishonesty.  Rudy figures that since this garbage worked for Bush-Cheney twice, it will work for him.  And as long as our press is as lazy and stupid as Chris Cillizza and Shailagh Murray, Rudy just might be right.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-0e-ettlinger29may29,0,3636830.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">LA Times</a> carries an article about the beloved Twinkie. The Twinkie plant that used to smell wonderful as traffic passed, but has been replaced by Nordstrom and Nieman Marcus and condos on top floors, forced to move to Maine, and now only assembled in the US. Ouch!</p>
<blockquote><p>Although eight of the ingredients in the beloved little snack cake come from domestic corn and three from soybeans, there are others — including thiamine mononitrate — that come from petroleum. Chinese petroleum. Chinese refineries and Chinese factories. And there are other unexpected ingredients that are much harder to trace. So much for the great &#8220;All-American&#8221; snack food.</p>
<p>When you bite into a Twinkie, you are chewing on an international nexus of suppliers. Most of our processed foods — salad dressing, ice cream, meal-replacement drinks — are processed with foreign additives: essential ones, like B vitamins for fortifying flour and the preservative sorbic acid, as well as Malaysian or Indonesian palm oil products, European wheat gluten, Peruvian colorants, Chadian gums and Swiss niacin, made from Swiss water, Swiss air (nitrogen) and North Atlantic or Middle Eastern oil. It&#8217;s a nice contrast to recall that Champagne comes only from Champagne, France.</p>
<p>Like many other industries, food additives have been off-shored. No major domestic vitamin or sorbic acid manufacturers remain in the U.S. Our last vitamin C plant closed in 2005 — in fact, it closed as I was speaking to an employee about a tour — and most of our artificial colors and flavors come from abroad as well. Our chemical industry is rapidly dismantling its expensive domestic plants and either forming joint ventures with Chinese companies or simply buying chemicals from them. This leads to lower food and pharmaceutical prices, but perhaps at the cost of quality control.</p>
<p>How can you have quality control when you don&#8217;t even know where the ingredient is coming from? During my Twinkie research, I was particularly surprised that many American food additive &#8220;manufacturers&#8221; buy chemicals, especially vitamins, from distributors and do not know, or don&#8217;t ask, where they come from. The distributors usually sing the same song, as they often buy from importers, and the importers buy from exporters who — no surprise — are often not able or willing to identify all of their sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even purses run $500 &#8211; 1500 at the new mall.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The above post is a real story. The transfigured mall was just recently opened, although the condos on top are not finished yet. They are sold out, however. The twinkie factory moved to a newer plant in Maine, where less rent is required.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>We ever hear that we must keep on growing the economy.  Given the operative economic model, growth implies more consumption, more production.  Impossible!  Simply impossible! This model only extends as long as there are unlimited resources, which of course there never were.  [Much of the ‘growth’ to date has been at the expense of irreplaceable resources (there was no accounting for replacement)].  Yet, with resources stretched nearly to the limit and global warming breathing down our necks, we still hear the growth will lead us out mantra.   Best, with China and India joining this grow (read consume) your way to prosperity parade and the rest of Asia, Latin America and Africa forming up to join at the rear, we figure out another way.  Needed, new economics, economics that <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/25/europe/environ.php">best provide for the most while using minimal resources.</a></p>
<p>Whither the economic model that requires just enough production, just enough resources to provide most those things essential a comfortable life?  Time and time to start this search, and somewhere is good a place to begin. </p>
<p>First, a quick glance at where we are.  Then, a few thoughts on what’s possible. </p>
<p>How much slack in the system?  How much less usage of resources with more efficient utilization, reuse and recycling?  Why make the buy today throw away tomorrow?   Why make anything that won’t last?  Why make anything other the reusable/recyclable of anything other the recycled/reusable?  </p>
<p>Today:  Millions upon millions of resource intensive automobiles are produced, most of which sit unused the greater portion of the time.   Americans buy houses at least two times too large fifty miles from anywhere that sit unoccupied the greater portion of the time.  People buy so much they don’t need they have to rent storage for the unneeded before they have room for the new unneeded they want to buy (‘Go shopping”, the President said.)  How much is being wasted on the under-utilized and unnecessary?</p>
<p>How efficient is the automobile as a means of transportation?  Not very, is it? What are the real transportation needs?  What would be the cost in terms of resources of a system that provided the requisite transportation?  How much CO2 producing fossil fuel energy goes into the production of underutilized automobiles? Now, … the same questions of the McMansion houses.</p>
<p>How efficient is exporting America’s manufacturing to China and then importing the manufactured goods?  Let’s add the replacement cost to the price of fossil fuel used in this transport of goods then recalculate the cost of the imports from China.   Shouldn’t energy costs now and henceforth also include the cost of cleaning up the atmosphere?</p>
<p>We are running, have run out of options on global warming; much of the pending damage is probably irreversible; yet, continuing on as we are will make it much worse.  Thus it is that any cuts in energy consumption pay double dividends.  (Note: Running out of oil may prove to be a blessing.)</p>
<p>It’s safe enough to assume that we could provide a very comfortable living for the first world using far fewer resources.   With how much room to spare?  Is it possible to do so, and vastly improve the lots of the billions of Chinese, Indians, Latin Americans, Africans, …?  With less in toto resource consumption than now?  Yes, that’s right, less!  Big step, no? </p>
<p>That we can and must ever keep on growing the economy is one of two great fallacies abounding.  The other is that conservation is the answer to the population problem.  Conservation to allow for population growth facilitates population growth.  Simply providing the earth’s current level of population a decent standard of living requires severe reduction of resource use and may not even be possible.   Further population increase demands more of the earth’s resources, ensures more widespread poverty.</p>
<p>Mechanism for distribution:</p>
<p>Today, producing manufactured goods requires an ever diminishing, one-fourth that of forty years ago and decreasing, workforce per unit of production.   Moreover, the current economic model’s wealth distribution is premised on the rewarding of the same said no longer needed productive labor.  So imbedded this premise that today it is a moral issue. So we not only need develop a new economic model, we’ll be requiring a change in morals.  But how moral the model that requires man labor in service another the forty-hour week?  Less moral than the sixty or eighty hour week?  Than child labor?  Ah, morals, they serve us well.  So, how immoral the ten-hour week?</p>
<p>How distribute wealth in this new economic system?  We’ll need redefine work to include things other production.  Perhaps, contribution is a better, more descriptive term?  Maybe expand the concept of service to include such as the arts and mentoring?  Arts are the measure of a great society, no?  We can always use cleaner safer streets and more, more beautiful parks.  Again, there is no reason people need ‘work’ a given number of hours per day, per week&#8230;</p>
<p>Distribution was a problem with the old model; oh, there were a few good years in the middle of the twentieth century when it worked pretty well, but of late and prior that time, it didn’t really work for most.  In any new model, workers/contributors should be paid for their contribution and management for theirs; and, if investors are required, they’re entitled a return.  For sure, the flow aspect of the old model will be greatly lessened due the reduced consumption; so, too, its role in distribution.  Rather someone getting to hold onto their paycheck a few hours, maybe they get to hold on to a lesser amount for a longer time.</p>
<p>Am I being shrill?  Hopefully.  Too shrill?  Impossible.  Economics and global warming are inextricably linked.  Humankind may try to muddle through this, allowing economics to evolve as before, but this time there isn’t time.  Some risk you don’t take no matter the odds.  Even if we could limp along a while longer with today’s economics to do so would only accelerate global warming. </p>
<p>If we don’t act quickly (and perhaps even if we do everything possible) many, many are going to be displaced; many are going to die. As food becomes more and more scarce and habitable areas few and far between, the rich will use armed militias to kill others so as to get their food and resources &#8211; a return to Barbarianism &#8211; in an effort to survive.  But this is not that much different from what we are now doing under Bush and Cheney, is it?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>This one was by Ken Melvin.</p>
<p>I note&#8230;  I wouldn&#8217;t predict a return to Barbarism here in the US or in the &#8220;civilized world.&#8221;  But we&#8217;ve certainly all collectively stood aside while a return to barbarism occurred in some parts of the world&#8230;  the Sudan, for instance.  So while the post above may seem pretty shrill, I&#8217;m not sure how shrill it is.</p>

<p>A comment was made the other day in Angry Bear that the real “cost” of the military in 1968 is understated because the military used conscription to mobilize the manpower to meets its goals in Vietnam and other commitments while fighting the “cold war”.</p>
<p>The US really should have paid more for &#8216;national security&#8217; in 1968, pay more by choosing the most expensive and profitable way of doing things like using an all volunteer force.</p>
<p>&#8216;National security&#8217; is so vital we should buy the top shelve brand for all its expectations no matter how expensive and unusual.</p>
<p>The commenter accused another poster of not knowing economics and failing to see the uncounted costs of the draft to the draftees and implicitly the community. That there are other issues is a fair point. All government actions have consequences, some intended, most not counted.</p>
<p>The consequences of conscription, colloquially the draft, include: benefits to the government; lower pay for the first term enlistees, reduced recruiting costs, faster growth in manning to respond to mobilization, hard to find skills join the uniformed services that might be too busy pursuing self interest, and a few more that do not come to mind.</p>
<p>There are some costs of the draft: higher turnover, more training (unless you do like WW II or lately with “stop loss” and draft for the duration) and a few more that do not come to mind. Costs to the individual include diverting plans and serving the nation, and maybe getting killed, maimed or psychologically disabled.</p>
<p>The draft seems to only benefit the government, of which we all are a part.</p>
<p>It is difficult to put firm costs or benefits to these. My conclusion from this exercise is the commenter was right and wrong. There are unmeasured consequences and outcomes. The commenter missed that when you consider soft outcomes there are two sides and they often balance or come close to equaling out.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to the general welfare from populating the military with draftees: they tend to balance out the influence of factions who see war as profit. Professional soldiers with the “for profit” suppliers see war as career and consider going off to battle is business development. No nation prospers in long wars; there are huge opportunity costs to continuously readying ourselves for war. Serving draftees provide needed a balance to the lifers.</p>
<p>As I thought about this I recalled the draft riots of 1863. One cause was the process where persons with resources could buy a “substitute” to serve in his place.</p>
<p>I see the current all volunteer force as the government hiring “substitutes” for persons who have &#8216;soft&#8217; reasons to have some one else fight their war for them.</p>
<p>The “substitutes” are now paid by the taxpayer and the benefits to the taxpayer are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The bottom lines in opposing the draft are: while draftees are cheaper, the opponents of the draft don&#8217;t want to give up their “substitutes” and draftees are dangerous to long war, for profit militarists.</p>
<p>The costs of today&#8217;s military operations do not matter as long as someone is making money. To take a note from Barry Goldwater: &#8216;Any profit in the most costly and inept defense of liberty no matter how wasted is not fraud.&#8217;</p>
<p>We have always made money at war.</p>
<p>The chickenhawks will get by by conning the taxpayer to buy their substitute.</p>
<p>But, why should the taxpayer buy a substitute for the chickenhawks?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m with Kaiser Permanente for health insurance.  So is the Ex-GF.  We&#8217;re happy with it, as far as things go.</p>
<p>Now, regular readers may recall something I noted a while back&#8230; earlier this year, when the Ex-GF switched to Kaiser (she was with the Motion Picture health care plan &#8211; she used to be a ward-robe consultant, but hasn&#8217;t done that in a while), we ensured there was a six month period with overlapping service &#8211; just in case she got something in her first few months, we didn&#8217;t want her new service being cancelled as a result of some pre-existing condition of which we were completely unaware.  Ah, the wonders of the efficient American system, in which it is necessary sometimes not just to have one insurance policy, but two at the same time!  T</p>
<p>OK.  Fast forward to today.  We&#8217;ve been having issues putting the Ex-GF on direct deposit payment.  Today I decided to take care of it once and for all.  We got a form from Kaiser that I had to fill out&#8230; and it asked for one piece of information that wasn&#8217;t on her card or any of the bills &#8211; the &#8220;provider number.&#8221;  I believe that&#8217;s the code for the employer who pays the bills&#8230; but we pay for it ourselves.  So I spent about thirty minutes going through the maze that makes up their automatic phone system.  Eventually I spoke to a human.  And here is the problem&#8230; they wouldn&#8217;t tell me what her provider number was &#8211; I needed her permission.  But by then she had left to run some errands.  I explained &#8211; &#8220;listen, I&#8217;ve written every check for her account so far, and I don&#8217;t want any personal information.  Just tell me what the code is to put down on the form.  I want to pay the bills automatically.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No dice.  WTF?  I understand keeping personal information, and medical information private.  And how much she pays.  But I wasn&#8217;t asking for anything like that.</p>
<p>So end result&#8230;  an hour later, we called back Kaiser and went through the same rigmarole.  In order to get a number that has zero meaning to anyone except Kaiser and doesn&#8217;t in any way provide any information at all.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m satisfied with Kaiser.  But this system is ridiculous.  I estimate that so far this year, we&#8217;ve spent about $1,500 on overlapping (duplicate) insurance for the Ex-GF and who knows how much time on the phone getting the details to work out.  And our time has value too &#8211; I could be spending time consulting. These are the wonders of the efficient American system.</p>
