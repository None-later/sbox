                                <p>OK, Fred was attacking <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/15/thompson.giuliani.ap/index.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> with this argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that conservatives beat liberals only when we challenge their outdated positions, not embrace them. This is not a time for philosophical flexibility, it is a time to stand up for what we believe in</p></blockquote>
<p>Well Fred – what do you fellows believe in?  Let’s read further:</p>
<blockquote><p>He touts his eight-year Senate tenure and boasts of working to further the conservative causes of smaller government, lower taxes, less regulation and conservative judges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smaller government and lower taxes?  This sounds like the usual sound bite from Rudy McRomney.  All four of them are talking about more defense spending paid for by tax cuts.  I guess it’s come to this – the long-run government budget constraint is an outdated position.  Seriously – are these four clowns running for President or the Stupidest Man Alive Contest?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_25/b4039009.htm">Business Week</a> carried an article by</p>
<blockquote><p>Are You a Victim of &#8216;Phantom&#8217; GDP? Here are four signs to help you determine whether your industry&#8217;s output and productivity are being overstated According to government statistics, output in almost every major manufacturing industry expanded between 2001 and 2005. That seems a little surprising since manufacturing employment dropped by more than 2 million jobs over that period, and nonpetroleum imports rose by roughly 35%.</p>
<p>In reality, some of those apparently healthy manufacturing industries are probably suffering from &#8220;phantom&#8221; gross domestic product. That is, as we show in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_25/b4039001.htm">cover story</a>, miscounting of import prices is causing domestic production to be overestimated, perhaps significantly. Here are some tips on how to figure out if an industry&#8217;s output and productivity is being overstated by phantom GDP. They use publicly available import price data and industry productivity data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="popup">http://www.bls.gov/</a>); trade data from the Census Bureau (<a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="popup">http://www.census.gov/</a>); and industry output data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (<a href="http://www.bea.gov/" target="popup">http://www.bea.gov/</a>). It must be stressed that these signs are not conclusive—but they do point you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Sign 1: Prices of imports are rising, even as offshoring is accelerating.</strong> The main reason why production is moving overseas is cost: It&#8217;s cheaper. So if the BLS is reporting that the price of imports in your industry is rising—but the imports keep coming—that&#8217;s a good clue that something is askew with the numbers. For example, reported import prices for furniture have risen by 6.7% since 2003, despite a massive move in the industry to produce goods in China. That&#8217;s a sign that the industry&#8217;s output, as measured by the government, is probably overstated.</p>
<p><strong>Sign 2: Products are rapidly replaced by new and improved models.</strong> For consumers, having the latest generation of cell phone or other electronic gadget can be a marvel. But for the folks at the BLS trying to track import prices, it can be a nightmare&#8230;.The best example: Televisions, where reported import prices have dropped by 15% over the past three years while retail prices have plummeted by almost triple that amount. That&#8217;s not very likely.</p>
<p><strong>Sign 3: Back-office operations and other services are being moved to lower-cost countries.</strong> So far we&#8217;ve concentrated on manufacturing and imports of goods—but offshoring of back-office operations and other services can create phantom GDP as well. We don&#8217;t have good tools to track it, but a very approximate rule of thumb is that when a service is first offshored, it will create phantom GDP equal to about one-half the cost savings. (Phantom GDP, as described in the cover story, arises when cost cuts and productivity improvements outside the country are mistakenly booked as coming from domestic production.)</p>
<p><strong>Sign 4: Sharp increases in reported productivity and output coincide with increases in imports .</strong> </p></blockquote>

<p>Since the accuracy and quantifiability of such a phantom measurement is up for grabs, I have no analysis to offer except:</p>
<p>As global trade increases, the ability of current measures such as GDP become less relevant.  Cactus has posted on this topic as well.</p>
<p>The accuracy of corporate reported numbers, who have little incentive to reveal accurate information to begin with in terms of their own internal interest, suffers some more.</p>
<p>Reporting on GDP as a measure of economic progress since the ever larger increases in outsourcing (especially the last few years) is fast becoming less useful in explaining the so-called other parts of the economy like wage stagnation, profits, productivity, and wealth.</p>
<p>Where the money goes is ever harder to determine, so claims to the contrary about trickles become even more  irrelevant.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>From the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-blackwater15oct15,0,3330051.story?coll=la-home-center">LA Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Bush administration deals with the fallout from the recent killings of civilians by private security firms in Iraq, some officials are asking whether the contractors could be considered unlawful combatants under international agreements.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The guards also operate under immunity from Iraqi law &#8212; immunity was granted in 2004 by U.S. officials &#8212; and in a murky status with respect to American laws.</p>
<p>The designation of lawful and unlawful combatants is set out in the Geneva Convention.Lawful combatants are nonmilitary personnel who operate under their military&#8217;s chain of command. Others may carry weapons in a war zone but may not use offensive force. Under the international agreements, they may only defend themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>And running carloads of civilians off the road by any means necessary because they don&#8217;t feel like spending time in traffic seems to be one way Blackwater personnel defend themselves.  </p>
<blockquote><p>For a guard who is only allowed to use defensive force, killing civilians violates the law of war, said Michael N. Schmitt, a professor of international law at the Naval War College and a former Air Force lawyer. &#8220;It is a war crime to kill civilians unlawfully in an armed conflict,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What an idiot.  Clearly, if those civilians were in a car that didn&#8217;t get the heck out of the way quickly, they weren&#8217;t civilians, were they?</p>
<blockquote><p>If the contractors were the aggressors in an incident, they could be deemed to be unlawfully using offensive force, said Scott Silliman, a retired Air Force lawyer and now a professor at Duke University. He said they could claim self-defense only if they had been fired on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only force they can use is defensive force,&#8221; Silliman said. &#8220;But we may be seeing some instances where contractors are using offensive force, which in my judgment would be unlawful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But could they, or should they earn a vacation in a resort in Cuba?</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. officials have described many of the suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates it holds at Guantanamo Bay as unlawful combatants either for taking part in hostilities against the United States or by supporting the hostilities while not part of a nation&#8217;s military.</p>
<p>By that standard, some of the private guards in Iraq and Afghanistan also could be seen as unlawful combatants, particularly if they have taken offensive action against unarmed civilians, experts said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we hire people and direct them to perform activities that are direct participation in hostilities, then at least by the Guantanamo standard, that is a war crime,&#8221; Schmitt said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to repeat:  supporting the hostilities while not part of a nation&#8217;s military seems to be the standard we used to put people in Gitmo.  </p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The 2004 immunity measure prevents Iraq from prosecuting private guards under Iraqi law. But some international law experts think Iraq could use international treaties to try contractors for killing civilians.</p>
<p>For now, such trials are considered unlikely, especially because the Iraqi government does not have the contractors in custody.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, its not like the Iraqi government hasn&#8217;t tried to kick Blackwater out water, or like it hasn&#8217;t wanted to put Blackwater personnel on trial.  But them&#8217;s the breaks when you&#8217;re the occupied, not the occupier.  </p>
<p>A final note from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of the current and former federal officials think the administration has an obligation under the Geneva Convention to clarify the contractors&#8217; status. Some are perplexed that the Bush administration did not resolve these issues &#8212; or at least discuss them more thoroughly &#8212; before putting contractors on such a complex battlefield.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who?  Who is perplexed?  There are a few obvious reasons why the Bush administration hasn&#8217;t made any effort to resolve these issues&#8230;  incompetence, laziness, and most importantly, because they like things the way they are &#8211; these guys aren&#8217;t much for following rules.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_10/012259.php">Kevin Drum</a>, we get to Victor Davis Hanson&#8217;s latest example of, well, for lack of a better term, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDJkMTUxNGMzZmZjMWY1YzdhZmEwYTIwYjk3ZTc0MTU=">Victor Davis Hansonism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is depressing is that a host of formal civilian and military officials, who during their tenure assured everyone that victory over the insurgents was in sight, then, upon leaving in the wake of criticism (one thinks of Bremer, Franks, Sanchez, etc.), post facto lambasted the effort. The net effect is a lack of credibility among the military and civilian overseers—sort of &#8216;why should I believe you now, since when and if you are relieved, you will only retroactively tell us how bad was what you now say is good.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole lot more blah blah blah there, but I was inspired to go back through the National Review Archives and see what our stalwart military genius had to say a while back. So let&#8217;s look at <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODU5YWQyN2FiNjVkNjg4Zjk0ZjhhZjM4MDFmZTNmODE=">this</a> from two years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>And in this type of socio-cultural war, a smaller foreign footprint is critical, since the last thing we wish is an enormous ostentatious American military bureaucracy in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The shortcoming was never the number of U.S troops per se, but our self-imposed straightjacket on rules of engagement that apparently discouraged the vital sorts of offensive operations that we have at last seen the last two months.</p>
<p>The lesson of Vietnam is that the south was more secure in 1973 without almost any American ground troops than with over 500,000 present in 1968.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>That the United States needs at least 4-5 more combat-ready divisions is not the same question as the wisdom of putting more American personnel into Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;  from this we learn, a build-up of troops (i.e., a &#8220;Surge&#8221;, so to speak) would be a bad idea.  Putting a straightjacket on rules of engagement &#8211; perhaps holding folks at Blackwater responsible if they shoot into a crowd of unarmed civilians &#8211; is also a bad idea.  And that bit about the vital sorts of offensive operations that we have at last seen the last two months sounds to me like Hanson felt we had finally stumbled onto the winning formula.  Two years ago.  </p>
<p>And incidentally, for those who like to blame the loss of Vietnam on the American withdrawal, clearly that&#8217;s not the case.  </p>
<p>So what does the future of two years ago hold?  Where were we going to be today, given that by then we had started to observe the vital sorts of offensive operations that we have at last seen the last two months?  Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>So here too there is general agreement emerging about our goals as outlined by most of the military&#8217;s top brass: in a year or two begin to downsize our presence in Iraq, ideally leaving behind special forces and elite units embedded within Iraqi units, backed up by instantaneous air support.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, a year or two from October 7, 2005, is either October 2006, or October 2007.  and Victor Davis &#8220;Always Quick to Expound at Length About Military Matters&#8221; Hanson doesn&#8217;t pipe up.  One senses his expert military opinion is that this must be correct.</p>
<p>But how good will it be?  Hanson asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who knows what Iraq will look like in, say, 15 months, given that its liberation had about that much lag time after the fall of the Taliban?</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the military genius, upon turning his steady gaze upon Afghanistan, might tell us to beware the Taliban, which now, in 2007, rises again, and feels itself strong enough to ignore overtures from the Karzai government?  Um, no.  He really is looking at Afghanistan as a leading indicator for Iraq, and in 2005, as far as VDH was concerned, that was all to the good.  </p>
<p>The point of all of this&#8230;  in October 2005 he told us the new strategy recently put in place in Iraq was working, that a Surge of troops was a bad idea, that we could expect some sort of a draw down beginning probably in October of 2006, but no later than October 2007, and that all was well in Afghanistan.  All that in one single post.  I believe I remember some other comments from Hanson that are equally buffoonish.  Which raises the question for VDH:</p>
<p>Why should I believe you now, since &#8230; you will only retroactively tell us how bad was what you now say is good?</p>
<p>And it raises any number of questions about the sort of people who take Victor Davis Hanson seriously at this point.</p>

<blockquote><p>But shouldn&#8217;t we give peace a chance? Frank Gaffney thinks so. For two decades, it was impossible to out-hawk this guy on anything. Gaffney is still a bellicose Reaganite, but the &#8220;bomb now&#8221; crowd is apparently giving even some neocons serious pause. &#8220;We know there&#8217;s broad and deep popular support for our side in Iran,&#8221; Gaffney says. Bombing dispersed and deeply buried nuclear sites not only isn&#8217;t practical, it &#8220;would almost certainly drive the population into the arms of the [radical] mullahs.&#8221; To try something else first &#8211; something that Gaffney concedes might not work &#8211; his Center for Security Policy began agitating after 9/11 to &#8220;divest terror.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Gaffney is right.  But I would never expect such wisdom from him.  Alas – something tells me that Dick Cheney is not listening to Frank this time.  </p>
<p>On the divest Iran front &#8211; I&#8217;m not so sure this will have much of an economic effect but at least Frank is thinking about non-military means for achieving results.  Good for him.</p>

<p>Our graph shows the Trade Weighted Exchange Index: Major Currencies.  While this is a nominal series, the Price-adjusted Major Currencies Dollar Index shows a similar pattern as does the Price-adjusted Broad Dollar Index.  Our recent dollar devaluation has put the dollar near its weakest level since we went off the Bretton Woods regime.  <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e682dc5c-7a64-11dc-9bee-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fe682dc5c-7a64-11dc-9bee-0000779fd2ac.html%3Fnclick_check%3D1&#038;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fgregmankiw.blogspot.com&#038;nclick_check=1">Martin Feldstein</a> celebrates this reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar has finally begun its long overdue correction. The dollar’s decline in recent weeks is just a prelude to the much more substantial fall needed to shrink the US current account deficit, running at a nearly $800bn annual rate, about 6 per cent of gross domestic product. If the dollar remained at its current level, the US trade deficit would continue to expand because Americans respond to rising incomes by increasing imports more rapidly than foreign buyers raise their imports from the US. Although a faster growth rate in the rest of the world would raise US exports and reduce the US trade deficit, experience shows that even substantially faster foreign growth would have only a very small impact. A lower dollar has to do most of the work of reducing the global trade imbalance.</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems about right to me.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: An AB reader directs us to <a href="http://www.safehaven.com/article-8606.htm">Peter Schiff</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A cheaper dollar helps domestic manufacturers because it makes local costs, such as wages and rents, decline in relation to the costs borne by international competitors. While this is true, it also means that American workers and landlords see a corresponding decline in the real values of their pay and rent. Given that such declines negatively impact living standards, such developments hardly seem worth celebrating.  Too often overlooked however is how the weakening dollar also works to increase costs for domestic manufacturers. A falling dollar raises the costs of raw materials, such as oil and metals, while simultaneously decreasing the relative costs that foreign competitors pay for the same supplies.  But it is not just raw materials prices that rise. Perhaps even more important will be the prices of foreign-made components that are used in American factories. In fact, many American &#8220;manufacturers&#8221; are really nothing more than assemblers of imported components.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter is raising two important points: (1) the terms of trade effect is limited to our value added; and (2) it comes at the cost of lower real wages. He’s correct on both points.  But then market corrections of imbalances are often not easy and not pretty.   If there is some more effective and less costly means of correcting the trade imbalance, the liberal in me would love to hear it.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is largely Dean Baker’s beat, but I’ve also been noticing what he’s noticing: sloppy doomsaying on Social Security seems to be making a comeback. During the great 2005 debate over privatization, I thought people like Dean and myself had managed to get across the points that there is no such program as Socialsecuritymedicareandmedicaid; that Social Security is in pretty good shape, so that projections of huge future spending on Socialsecuritymedicareandmedicaid are mainly about the Medicareandmedicaid part of it; and that in general, what we have is a health care crisis, with the costs of an aging population much smaller and more manageable. But now casual talk about the need to “fix” Social Security is creeping back into the discourse. Folks, Social Security is in pretty good shape; it’s not clear that there even is a long-run shortfall, and if there is it’s a much less pressing problem than many others. The only reason we hear so much about Social Security is that there are powerful political forces that want to kill it, for ideological reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Years ago when Lawrence Lindsey was spinning this issue, Paul had a thought that would make the General Fund not look so bad – have the payroll tax pay for Social Security benefits and the Defense Department too.  Paul was mocking Dr. Lindsey’s spinning of course, but is the current accounting gimmicks any worse?</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Last night, Howard Dean was asked on C-Span, ‘Why not universal health care?’, responded that it was impossible to do in one svelte move because of the power of the insurance lobby.  He then went on to propose lowering Medicare eligibility to 55 and have all those under 30 included.  We all know that Howard Dean is bright but this is especially good.  His thinking went along these lines:  Lowering the eligibility to 55 takes the strain off corporate America.  And, as everyone knows, men over 50 finding themselves unemployed are up the proverbial creek without a paddle in part because insurance companies are telling employers not to hire anyone over 50.  With insurance no longer a problem, men and women over fifty would have a better shot at reentry and society could utilize their experience.  In re covering those under 30, it doesn’t cost anything to insure this particular group.  Beautiful.  It’s feasible, and it’s a great transitional first step toward universal coverage.  Of course, he may not have said this exactly, but it was all there.</p>
<p>All this brought to mind the fact that no one in America other those on Medicare, VA, or retired Congress members/civil servants really has health insurance.  Lose your job – lose health insurance.  Have your own coverage and get sick, lose your health insurance.  Self-employed with your own coverage and your child has needed surgery, lose your health insurance.  Life insurance is much the same, e.g., if you have a term policy for 40 years and miss a payment you are no linger insured and the carrier sticks the policy money in their pocket;  a good part of the beauty of Social Security is that it always there.  Shouldn’t it be that all your payments to health care insurers, to life insurers is there in reserve so that if bad luck befalls you still have some coverage, some life insurance?</p>

<p>The above was by reader Ken Melvin.  I&#8217;d just like to add a few thoughts myself.  The Ex-GF and I pay for our health insurance.  Its a lot.  Earlier this year, when we got married, we switched the Ex-GF from her old health insurance policy to Kaiser, the company with which I have a policy.  Because of horror stories about what could happen if one gets sick in the first few months after switching to new insurance (i.e., having one&#8217;s insurance canceled for not reporting a pre-existing condition, even one that one doesn&#8217;t know one has), we maintained two overlapping insurance policies for the Ex-GF for a few months.  I can&#8217;t believe anyone in America can think of a system like this as anything remotely efficient.</p>
