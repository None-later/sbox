                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-21-07bud.htm">Richard Kogan</a> reviews this GOP spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Administration has charged that these funding levels represent large, fiscally irresponsible increases in federal spending that would threaten fiscal stability and the economy.  It has threatened to veto most of the forthcoming appropriations bills.  The Administration’s sharp criticisms have been echoed by a number of Republican congressional leaders, such as Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-CA), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, who accused the Democratic majority of “spending lust.”  Some 147 House Republican members &#8211; more than one-third of the House membership &#8211; have pledged to sustain the anticipated vetoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard says this GOP spin is at odds with the facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some 81 percent of the $53.1 billion increase in appropriations under the emerging bills consists of increases for military and homeland security programs that the President himself requested.  (These increases are not related to Iraq and Afghanistan, which are classified as “emergency spending” and hence not included in this analysis.) This 81 percent figure climbs still higher when one takes into account the congressional increases for the State Department and international affairs that the Administration also requested. Less than one-tenth (or $5 billion) of the $53.1 billion funding increase reflected in the congressional targets for the 2008 appropriations bills is for increases for the eight domestic appropriations bills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review his table one that compares inflation-adjusted 2007 spending to the proposals from the White House versus Congress.  The $53.1 billion increase that Congress is proposing represents a 5.9% increase in total discretionary programs.  This breaks down into the following components:</p>
<p>Military/Homeland Security is $45.7 billion, which is an 8.9% increase.</p>
<p>International Programs is $2.4 billion, which is a 7.4% increase.</p>
<p>Domestic Spending is $5 billion, which is a 1.4% increase.  </p>
<p>The White House proposal arrives at an increase of only $29.8 billion by advocating that domestic spending be reduced by $16.4 billion.  OK, if domestic spending is supposed to be reduced in real terms, isn’t time for the GOP to fess up which specific programs get slashed?</p>

<p>As another follow-up to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/06/apples-to-apple.html">David Altig</a>, let me offer a bit of evidence provided by <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2">FRED</a> (the Federal Reserve Economic Data) courtesy of the St. Louis FED.  FRED provides a quarterly series of a measure of potential GDP (GDP* in my table) from the Congressional Budget Office.  I have taken my four data points (1980QIV, 1992QIV, 2000QIV, and 2006QIV) and shown actual GDP (2000$) versus potential GDP.  The GDP gap is also calculated to be around 2.4% as of 1980IV, 1.4% as of 1992QIV, negative 1.6 percent as of 2000QIV, and 2006QIV.  From this, I compare the average annual GDP growth rates to the average annual growth rates in potential GDP.  </p>
<p>As you look at the calculated GDP gaps, you might be thinking like me – don’t they look rather small?  But suppose we add 0.6% to each figure – making our revised gap 3% when Carter left office, 2% when Bush41 left office, and around 1% now.  Of course, we would still be showing real GDP above potential GDP about the time that Dick Cheney was to replace Al Gore as the Vice President.  Didn’t Cheney say we were in a recession at the end of 2000?  Or something like that?  Whether we use the CBO gap figures or my suggested modification, the implied growth rates in potential GDP would be about the same.  </p>
<p>I need to slightly alter something from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/david-altig-schools-me-on-business.html">this post</a> with respect to this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>My case for using this time frame to estimate long-term growth is that we were in similar situations in regards the business cycle at the beginning of my 12 year period and at the end of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we see in our table is that the gap was smaller just before Clinton took office than just before Reagan took office.  So the 3.04% average annual growth rate for the Reagan-Bush41 era actually slightly overstates the growth in potential GDP.  Of course, this confirms David’s point that potential GDP during the Clinton years was less than actual GDP growth, while actual growth over the past six years understates potential growth.  But notice something: 3.2% still trumps the less than 3.0% growth in potential GDP that we’ve seen from those tax deferral Administrations.  </p>
<p>So could it be – fiscal irresponsibility ala free lunch supply-side tax cuts is bad not only in terms of reducing national savings and long-term growth but also in terms of Keynesian macroeconomic stabilization policy?  The GOP predicted that the 1993 tax increase would be followed by a recession, but as David points out, we didn’t see this predicted recession.</p>

                                <p>Consider a short story about two people. In broad outlines, it is the story of tremendous wealth and privilege, and tremendous poverty and oppression. </p>
<p>One of the characters is born into tremendous wealth and power, receives the best possible education, healthcare, etc. The other is born into squalor, receives at best an inferior education, healthcare, and is always hungry. And let&#8217;s assume a simple relationship between the two&#8230; perhaps the second one lives on property owned by and works for the first person. Because the second person lives hand to mouth, we can assume he/she has never had an opportunity to improve his/her station in life. For a story like this, we can assume the first person lives a life of leisure and the second struggles to survive every day. And let&#8217;s say further that the parents of the two had the same relationship, as perhaps did their parents.</p>
<p>Now, we can fill in time and place as we wish. Perhaps this is the 12th century Europe, and we&#8217;re discussing a lord or lady and a serf. Maybe its a slave owner and a slave in Brazil in 1890. Perhaps we&#8217;re discussing a Chinese Mandarin and a Chinese Peasant, or a member of some Arab royal family and a simple camel herder. Maybe we&#8217;re even talking about someone yet to come &#8211; the next leader of North Korea and a North Korean drone in some work camp or other. In any of these instances, most or all of us would recognize the injustice and it would color our thinking about the characters. But what if one of our two characters are an heir or heiress to a great fortune, and the other is a poor resident of South Central Los Angeles or even some small town in Louisiana. Does that change your opinion of the two characters? Why?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In a post where I praised <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/bruce-bartlett-on-bush-boom.html">Bruce Bartlett</a>, I tried the following experiment at comparing long-term growth rates:</p>
<blockquote><p>We often hear about average annual real GDP growth being around 3.5%. This was true for the period after World War II up to the end of the Carter Administration. Since then? </p>
<p>From 1980QIV to 1992QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 3.0%. </p>
<p>From 1992QIV to 2000QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 3.6%. </p>
<p>From 2000QIV to 2006QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 2.6%. </p>
<p>Notice something? During the low tax eras (Reagan-Bush41 and Bush43), we witnessed lower growth rates. During the Clinton Administration – which began with its fiscally responsible policies with a tax rate increase – we saw strong growth. Maybe part of the explanation has to do with the impact on national savings from fiscal irresponsibility justified by phony free lunch promises.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/06/apples-to-apple.html">David Altig</a> objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a bit of a problem with the evidence here.  To get the gist of my objection, take the following quiz: </p>
<p>Which one of these time periods did not include a recession?</p>
<p>a. 1980QIV to 1992QIV<br />b. 1992QIV to 2000QIV<br />c. 2000QIV to 2006QIV</p>
<p>If you answered b, you win the gold star.  And if you knew that, are you really surprised that the period from 1992 through 2000 had higher average growth than the other two periods, which did include recessions?  Suppose we instead make the comparisons including only the expansion years of the Reagan-Bush41 and Bush43 administrations?  Here&#8217;s what you get:<br />From 1983 to 1989, average annual real GDP growth = 4.3%. </p>
<p>From 1992 to 2000, average annual real GDP growth = 3.7%. </p>
<p>From 2002 to 2006, average annual real GDP growth = 2.9%.</p>
<p>You could just as well look at those numbers and conclude that potential GDP growth &#8211; measured cycle to cycle &#8211; is declining through time.  And if you accept pgl&#8217;s characterization of irresponsible policy, followed by responsible policy, followed by irresponsble policy, you might then conclude that policy has very little to do with that trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>David has a point here, but I have to object to how he is making it.  Let me explain by talking about his and my characterization of the Reagan years.  I think David and I can agree that this 1983 to 1989 period was one from the bottom of a rather deep recession to the top of the boom that subsequently followed.  So part of the high growth rate observed during this period was from normal Keynesian effects of returning to full employment.  Now if one thinks of the economy that Reagan inherited from Carter (1980QIV) and the one that Clinton inherited from Bush41 (1992QIV), neither was exactly at full employment.  But we had similar unemployment rates as well as the beginning of tepid recoveries from mild recessions.  My case for using this time frame to estimate long-term growth is that we were in similar situations in regards the business cycle at the beginning of my 12 year period and at the end of it.  </p>
<p>So what is David’s point?  The eight years of the Clinton term in office began with the economy that was below full employment and ended with the economy being very near full employment.  I will concede that the observed 3.6% average annual growth rate was in part due to Keynesian effects.  But to suggest that the period from 1980QIV to 1992QIV proves that the free lunch supply-siders have it right is absurd.  Of course, David is not trying to make this point.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on hospital beds. Seriously. Here’s the idea. I tried to think of measures of the quality of healthcare, both in terms of outcomes and in terms of inputs. I’ll be leaving outcomes for another day. Inputs include things like number of hospitals, doctors, beds, etc. Number of hospitals doesn’t quite work… with consolidation and larger hospitals, fewer hospitals might be able to serve more people. Number of doctors might work, but from what I can tell from visiting friends and relatives in the hospital over the years, most care is provided by nurses. Number of nurses might work, but I suspect the quality of nurses can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p>And then there are hospital beds. While its possible the number of hospital beds per thousand people might decline over time as the population gets healthier (e.g., fewer beds are needed for polio victims these days than in 1923), for the most part, more beds means more capacity to care for patients, and fewer beds means less capacity to care for patients, regardless of whether that care is provided by doctors, nurses, midwives, etc. </p>
<p>FWIW, the main reason I’m going with hospital beds is this… (Long time readers may recall this as I’ve mentioned bits and pieces before.) When I was in grad school, most of my classmates were of the, um, foreign persuasion. Most of the Latin American students were male, married, and a bit older, and they brought their wives and children with them. And most of them were sent by the government to get a Ph.D. after which they would return to a high level position. In plain English – these were people with resources, and pretty good health insurance both at home and here in the US. Anyway, most of these foreign students reproduced while here in the US. And here’s the interesting thing… in every single case the wife went home to deliver the resultant offspring. This didn’t mesh with my absolute knowledge that the US had the best healthcare system in the world, so eventually I asked what the deal was. And this is what I was told: “If my wife goes home, she’ll be in the hospital for a week, and in that time the hospital can catch any problems that develop. Plus she’ll be around family. But if she has the kid here, they’ll kick her out of the hospital the next day or the day after.”</p>
<p>Not that I expect the experience of upper crust Mexicans and Peruvians and Chileans and so forth is at all representative of not-upper crust Mexicans and Peruvians and Chileans and so forth, but it seems to me that it takes more hospital beds to keep grieving, make that recent mothers in the hospital for a week than it does to keep them there for 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>Its not a perfect measure, but its what I’m going with. (Your thoughts on the use of this measure are welcome. I can be persuaded to put another measure on the to-do list.) </p>
<p>OK. Data on hospital beds is available from 1970 to 2003 from <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/hnpstats/query/default.html"> The World Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population data platform </a> and for various years including 2004 from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0162.xls">the Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>. I made sure the data matched up where the series overlapped, and it does, including for past editions of the Statistical Abstract which contain data on hospital beds, so I think its reasonable to conclude the World Bank’s source is also the Census’ (they’re the ones that put together the Statistical Abstract) source, at least when it comes to data on hospital beds in the US.</p>
<p>So here’s the graph…</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnprfJumkhI/AAAAAAAAATo/38LFYJ78CpY/s1600-h/Hospital+beds,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnprfJumkhI/AAAAAAAAATo/38LFYJ78CpY/s320/Hospital+beds,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Gazork! Capacity is decreasing over time. Now, unless there was a huge surplus of hospital beds, or people are just not getting sick any more, this is probably not a good trend. More the function of cost cutting than interest in providing care.</p>
<p>Next, we have a summary of the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnpraZumkgI/AAAAAAAAATg/SCMDfPU7scs/s1600-h/Hospital+beds,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnpraZumkgI/AAAAAAAAATg/SCMDfPU7scs/s320/Hospital+beds,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clinton doesn’t do so well. It might have something to do with him doing the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html"> best job of cutting health care costs</a>. Cutting health care costs could be accomplished by providing less health care. (We’ll try to measure outcomes in a future post so we’ll see if that’s true then.) Of course, Carter was second best at containing health costs, and he was third best on this list. </p>
<p>A more interesting point… this is the first series that I’ve looked at so far that GW actually comes out best. Reagan comes in second. </p>
<p>Now one more thing I’d like to do… Below is an international comparison… hospital beds per thousand people for all countries for which the World Bank has that data for the year 2000. Every single one. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnprVZumkfI/AAAAAAAAATY/nYnPwcItyH8/s1600-h/Hospital+beds,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnprVZumkfI/AAAAAAAAATY/nYnPwcItyH8/s320/Hospital+beds,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As an American, I’m not sure I like where the US is sitting. More beds doesn’t necessarily mean a better system; I think most of us would agree that some former Soviet states have lousy healthcare systems. But what about Japan or Germany? They get healthcare outcomes (longevity, infant mortality, etc.) that are at least as good as American outcomes, at much lower cost. And the opportunity for care seems greater there.</p>
<p>So I’ll close with two thoughts…</p>
<p>1. I keep hearing that the US has the best healthcare system in the world. People who say that are quick to point out the output of American pharmaceutical companies, and how wealthy foreigners come to the US for exotic operations. That strikes me the same as arguing that Italy has the best transportation system in the world because wealthy people the world over choose to drive Ferraris and Lamborghinis. Folks who make this argument never ask themselves questions like&#8230; how many Italians are driving Ferraris, and what are the roads like in Italy?</p>
<p>2. As always, readers are welcome to prove me wrong. <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/hnpstats/query/default.html">The World Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population data platform</a> has data on a whole lot of series, even for fictional countries like Australia and evil countries like France (sure, for the time being, after the last election we&#8217;re pretending they&#8217;re not evil, but they&#8217;ll be going back to their nefarious socialist ways any time, I just know it) and Canada. I have no spent quality time with that data repository – I just discovered it yesterday. If you spot a healthcare related series for which the US is doing better than everyone else there or anyplace else that seems reputable, let me know. (Topping the world on spending does not make the US better.) Mention it in comments or send me an e-mail. I will put it in a post.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>

<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/reader-dan-on-ptsd-part-2.html">Angry Bear reader Buffpilot</a> for joining voices in a liberal/conservative plea for doing the right thing. Please refer to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/reader-dan-on-ptsd-part-2.html">this post for context on PTSD</a>, healthcare, and Therapist1 comments. Clearly there is great need to increase funding for cognitive sciences and occupational therapy needed for our soldiers and their families in Tricare.</p>
<p>Next a post on medical care and cognitive science reimbursements in a scholarly piece by <a href="http://www.jeromegroopman.com/blog/">Dr. Jerome Groopman</a> is useful to further thoughts on our next step to thinking about our health system, cognitive sciences, and other medical fields.

<blockquote><p>Another piece in the New England Journal of Medicine that I found of interest was a series of letters about medical education. I feel strongly that it is time to integrate cognitive psychology into the curriculum. Physicians are making decisions all the time under conditions of uncertainty, with limited data. The human mind is wired to take shortcuts, and our biases and emotions can strongly color our reasoning. Scant attention is paid to this critical cognitive dimension which underlies misdiagnosis.</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>Changing behavior is difficult, but, in my experience, most likely succeeds when there is time allotted to the discussion, a close bond between the patient and doctor, and continuing encouragement. It boils down to words and positive feelings, and the health benefits can be extraordinary. Much of what primary care physicians do involves preventive medicine. Unfortunately, the system, based on its payments, is telling us that this has meager value. </p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>As Ginsburg and Berenson point out (in the New England Journal of Medicine), there are powerful lobbying forces against changing payment schedules, and even though a bone is thrown on occasion to increase payment for a certain cognitive practice, at the same time, payments are reduced for other kinds of thinking medicine. It ends up as a wash, if not a reduction in rewards for those doctors who are trying to prevent disease or make a thoughtful diagnosis that takes time.</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>The question remains, who is a good doctor, and, moreover, who is the right doctor for any individual? The best answer that I have found for myself and my family is a doctor who thinks with us, explains clearly what is in her mind, how she arrived at her working diagnosis, and why the offered treatment makes sense for us as individuals. She may refer to guidelines and &#8220;best practices,&#8221; but clearly takes into account the spectrum of human biology and customizes our care to fit both our clinical needs as well as our emotional, social, and psychological dimensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We currently have a system that costs too much but appears to have professionals leaving in significant numbers because the pay is too low. It was developed as a cost containment structure based on metrics and evidenced based best practice as developed by insurance companies. The question then is to ask who gets rewarded, and what kinds of procedures are rewarded. Clearly it is not cognitive sciences. Who else?</p>

Let it not be said that I won&#8217;t post something with which I disagree.  Also, some feel I shouldn&#8217;t put in comments at the bottom of a post with which I disagreed so any comments by me will be in the comment section only.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the beginning of CoRev&#8217;s post. </p>
<blockquote><p>For several years now we have heard of global warming/climate change.  Is it happening?  Absolutely, measurements around the world prove it.  The latest theory is that it is caused by man&#8217;s creation of CO2, and this 3% addition to the atmosphere has caused this rise in temperature.</p>
<p>No questions, yet?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://www.norcalblogs.com/watts/weather_stations/">this skeptic</a> has started a survey of California weather stations.  You know, those official cites reporting temperature being used the the  OFFICIAL temperature models.  His report after reviewing just a handful is interesting.  More interesting is his pictures of stations.  </p></blockquote>

<p>Note from cactus.  Apologies, but I&#8217;m kind of swamped right now and I don&#8217;t have time to import all the pictures.  Be advised that there are some interesting photos (Nooooo!  Not that interesting.  They&#8217;re work safe.) and accompanying verbage at <a href="http://pcrevolt.blogspot.com/2007/06/absolute-proof-of-mans-impact-on-global.html">CoRev&#8217;s post</a>.

                                <p>Credit goes (again) to <a href="http://bartlettblog.townhall.com/g/d03f2376-c47c-4077-9abc-9190fc776bf5">Bruce Bartlett</a> for getting the facts right:</p>
<blockquote><p>For an interview with a reporter about the state of the economy, I looked up a few numbers that are interesting.  I compared the state of the economy today to where it was at the exact same point during the previous business cycle.  Thus, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the most recent recession ended in November, 2001.  If you count forward 21 quarters to the first quarter of 2007, we see the following:</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product: Up 16.4 percent<br />Real gross private domestic investment: Up 10.2 percent<br />Payroll employment: Up 5.3 percent<br />Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s 500 stock index: Up 34.2 percent</p>
<p>Viewed in isolation, these numbers don&#8217;t seem too bad.  For example, real GDP has risen at a 3.1 percent annual rate since the end of the recession.  But in areas such as this, there are no objective criteria for saying what is a good performance from a bad one; only experience can guide us.  Thus it is interesting to look at the same numbers above counted forward the same number of months from the end of the previous recession, which the NBER tells us ended in March, 1991:</p>
<p>Real GDP: Up 17.9 percent<br />Real investment: Up 51.2 percent<br />Payroll employment: Up 10.8 percent<br />S&#038;P 500: Up 82.2 percent</p>
<p>It is obvious that by every standard, the recovery and expansion after the 1990-91 recession was significantly better than that after the 2001-01 recession.  Recognizing this fact is important for several reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Credit goes to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/bruce_bartlett__1.html">Mark Thoma</a> for this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also wish the mindless repetition of false mantras would end, but I don&#8217;t expect it to change much. In the media, the commodity being sold is entertainment, not information, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising that the two will come into conflict even on shows labeled as news. Still, I would have thought there would be more market discipline than exists now. There seems to be little penalty for providing false or misleading information (even if it leads to war) so long as the entertainment value is high enough (unless you count even more bookings and more exposure in the media as a penalty). I wish I knew how to bring the information and entertainment objectives into better alignment, we need it, but I don&#8217;t know what the answer is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark is correct that the media is just awful at reporting accurate information on the economy.  Which is why it is so refreshing to see honest conservatives like Bruce getting space over at Townhall.  He would not be allowed by the folks at the National Review to write such honest information – but this is why other outlets should give Bruce more space.  He does not need to sully his good reputation by writing for a rag like the National Review.  But why we are putting out accurate information, let me just had a few longer term averages for real GDP growth.  We often hear about average annual real GDP growth being around 3.5%.  This was true for the period after World War II up to the end of the Carter Administration.  Since then?  </p>
<p>From 1980QIV to 1992QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 3.0%.  </p>
<p>From 1992QIV to 2000QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 3.6%.  </p>
<p>From 2000QIV to 2006QIV, average annual real GDP growth = 2.6%.  </p>
<p>Notice something?  During the low tax eras (Reagan-Bush41 and Bush43), we witnessed lower growth rates.  During the Clinton Administration – which began with its fiscally responsible policies with a tax rate increase – we saw strong growth.  Maybe part of the explanation has to do with the impact on national savings from fiscal irresponsibility justified by phony free lunch promises.  </p>
<p>Yet – the media cannot be bothered with such a simple story.  Now I don’t expect Faux News to tell us the truth about anything.  But CNN?  MSNBC?  ABC?  CBS?  NBC?  Oh wait – what’s the latest on Paris Hilton?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Check out the comments box over at Bruce’s blog.  Seems one of his readers named RW is a true believer of the free lunch supply-side view we often hammer here.  But I don’t have to hammer RW’s spin over at Bruce’s place as Bruce is doing a masterful job of making whatever point I might have to offer.  And if you think that I’m suggesting our readers should check Bruce’s blog out more often – you are right.  At least I will.</p>

<p>This post is on the decision to reproduce. Here’s a look at the <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/fertility/tabH1.xls">percentage of women ages 15 – 44 that are childless</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnkYYZumkeI/AAAAAAAAATQ/vlNSSDdafXM/s1600-h/childless,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnkYYZumkeI/AAAAAAAAATQ/vlNSSDdafXM/s320/childless,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note… the following years were unavailable, and for the graph, I extrapolated them linearly: 1977- 1979, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1996- 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003)</p>
<p>For the folks on the right who talk about how the US is going to be over-run by them foreigner folks (and point with fear to Europe as our future), this can’t be good news.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnkYRpumkdI/AAAAAAAAATI/UhywRxYll4E/s1600-h/childless,+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnkYRpumkdI/AAAAAAAAATI/UhywRxYll4E/s320/childless,+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, this is one series that doesn’t divide neatly among Dems and Reps. Reagan showed the slowest increase in childlessness, which has to gladden the hearts of the right in more ways than one.  (Frankly, I can&#8217;t remember Reagan doing better than Clinton on any of these series we&#8217;ve looked at so far except driving up debt.)  Following Clinton was GW, Carter, and then GHW.</p>
<p>Childlessness increased more quickly in Clinton’s second term than his first. A question of the Welfare Reform Act? Income?</p>
<p>I took a look at income. Its not straightforward due to the missing data, but I created a variable called “% change in pct childless from last available year.” Thus, for 1984, I took the percentage change in the percentage of women that are childless from 1983 to 1984. But, for 1990, I took the percentage change from 1988, since data for 1989 was not available. Then I created an equivalent percentage change in real median income, pretending that real median income was missing the same list of years.</p>
<p>The correlation between the change in <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">real median income</a> and the change in the percentage of women who become childless is –0.21. (The missing data makes it impractical to do correlations of the lags of one or another series.) It would seem that more rapid increases in income are loosely correlated with decreases (or slower increases) in childlessness. I do know that rings true with the Ex-GF and I. While we’re doing OK, we are concerned enough (as noted in a post yesterday) about income to be postponing starting a family. And it seems to fit the pattern with many people I know.</p>
<p>But I think one more thing is at play&#8230; it seems to me that confidence about the future also plays in. As I noted, the Ex-GF and I are doing OK now&#8230; we&#8217;re worried about whether we will still be doing OK in a few months. Interestingly enough, the correlation between the percentage change in the share of women that are childless and the percentage change in <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/">consumer sentiment</a> is also -.21. As people are more confident about the future, they are more likely to have children.</p>
<p>Next few posts involving data… looking at healthcare.</p>

                                <p>A dumb question&#8230; why is Saddam so demonized? I understand, the guy was a monster. But was he more of a monster, than, say, the folks in charge in Kuwait &#8211; over whom we went to war with Iraq, or Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the first thing about the folks who run Kuwait. My guess is that GHW Bush knows them well. So maybe that part of the question was a dumb question. </p>
<p>But I have read a bit about Saudi Arabia. From what I can tell, the folks running Saudi Arabia can be pretty brutal. It hasn&#8217;t had to be as brutal as Saddam was, but the indications (such as public executions and frightening enthusiasm for torture) are that it could be if it felt it necessary. Reasons I can think of that the Saudis haven&#8217;t had to be as brutal include:</p>
<p>1. Much smaller percentage of the population oppressed by the majority (15% (if I recall the number correctly) of Shia oppressed in SA, 20% of Sunni running Iraq under Saddam)<br />2. The SA government demonstrates much more willingness to get rid of huge numbers of people. (e.g., close to a million Yemenis expelled from the country in a bit over a year in 80 and 81)<br />3. Far fewer liberties given to the Saudi population (one can&#8217;t take a mile if one isn&#8217;t given an inch) than to Iraqis under Saddam. Heck, for all practical purposes women are property in SA.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on, but Saddam is demonized (as well he should be) but our government&#8217;s relationship with SA is <a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&#038;tab=wi&#038;hl=en&#038;q=abdullah%20bush">far more cordial</a>. </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t anyone bothered by this?</p>
