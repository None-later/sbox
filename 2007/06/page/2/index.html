                                <p><a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/06/white-house-dup.html">Justin Rood</a> catches the White House talking out of both sides of its mouth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a few months after blasting the congressional practice of diverting millions in taxpayer dollars to pet projects, President Bush has slipped into current legislation more than 100 so-called &#8220;earmarks&#8221; worth over $1 billion &#8211; including nearly $6 million for work on the White House. The provisions appear to draw a stark contrast with the president&#8217;s harsh words for earmarks and their proponents in his State of the Union speech in January … The president&#8217;s earmarks, for projects including national park improvements, land purchases and new government facilities, have drawn unusual on-the-record criticism from Republican lawmakers, who typically eschew public displays of disaffection with the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now one would hope that the White House be blasted for this apparent hypocrisy.  But the White House explains itself thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a striking difference here&#8221; between White House earmarks and congressional earmarks, said administration spokesman Sean Kevelighan. The White House chooses earmarks &#8220;[in] a way that is competitive or merit-based,&#8221; while Congress tends to choose earmarks &#8220;based on geography, seniority and special interests,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Really?!</strong></p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The other day I had a post on the murder rate.  I wanted to see how guns entered into the picture&#8230; and could find data on gun ownership and sales.  I did find data on the shares of stock of a company which sells primarilly to the, um, sportsmen market in the US, and found, not surprisingly, that it rises more quickly relative to the S&#038;P 500 right before the murder rate goes up, and falls more quickly relative to teh S&#038;P 500 right before the murder rate goes down.</p>
<p>But it would really be nice to have data on guns.  Which is not going to happen.   From what I can tell, the gubmint isn’t even allowed to keep records of who owns a gun or who wants to buy a gun for longer than it takes to do a background check.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I believe the gubmint is allowed a lot of leeway in collecting information about what people say, and its allowed to keep that information forever.  </p>
<p>Maybe I’m missing something, but that would imply to me one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1.  The right to bear arms is more important than the right to say what one wants in and of itself.  Seems odd… the first amendment to the Constitution was freedom of speech, the right to bear arms was only the second individual right.  Besides, there are places where most speech is permissible, but bearing arms is entirely forbidden.  Examples can be located at almost any airport.</p>
<p>2.  The right to bear arms is more important than the right to speak because it defends and individual’s freedom of speech from a government.  But since freedom of speech is what makes organizing with one’s fellow citizens possible, a person’s right to bear arms for resistance against an oppressive government does not extend to mutual defense if this is true.  Each person is intended to be on his/her own when dealing with the government.  Another problem is that if we assume that allowing the government to keep track of what one says is not infringing on one’s freedom of speech, how can having the government keep track of which guns we own be infringing on the right to bear arms?  Alternatively, if the government keeping track of our gun purchases is infringing on gun ownership, how is allowing the government to keep track of what anyone says and said (many years earlier) not infringing on freedom of speech?</p>
<p>3.  The rights are equally important, but speech is watched more closely because it can more quickly and easily inflict damage on one’s fellow citizens.  I think this one is ludicrous on its face.  I personally don’t care what my crazy neighbor says or to whom he says it, as long as he’s not yelling when I’m trying to sleep.  But if I see him walking around with a gun I’m calling the cops.  </p>
<p>4.  There’s one heck of a gun lobby and some types of guns whose continued legalization they favor are used exclusively or almost exclusively for killing people.  Furthermore, they know it, everyone else knows it, and they just want to make sure nobody can prove it.  This one actually makes sense &#8211; if the gun lobby thought they could prove that with more guns we&#8217;d all be safer, you can bet the numbers would be available. </p>
<p>Any other possibilities I might have missed?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let’s look at the change in federal public officials (appointed and elected) charged and/or convicted with corruption.  I found data going back to 1980… 1986 to 2005 from the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pin/docs/AnnReport_05.pdf">Report to Congress on the Activities and Operations of the Public Integrity Section for 2005</a>, and for years from 1980 to 199 from the <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:oRol66AmuSEJ:www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pin/docs/Annual_Report_1999.pdf+%22report+to+congress+on+the+activities+and+operations+of+the+public+integrity+section%22+1990&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=1&#038;gl=us">1999 version of the report</a>.  A few comments before I put up some graphs… this includes not just administration officials, but also judges.  It also includes folks from past administations…  for example, Sandy Berger is one of the observations for 2005.  And there are always people who manage to run the clock for one heck of a long time, and so may not be tried until many years after the, um, alleged crime.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind&#8230; the figures only deal with “public corruption”- I believe that means Claude Allen is not on the list… petty shoplifting is not public corruption.  Even when the guy who did it had the title of &#8220;Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.&#8221;  (I note.. I believe Allen got himself a nice deal:  his record will be expunged if he successfully completes probation, so it will be as if his shoplifting never happened.  Perhaps a future President might nominate him for a judgeship.)  </p>
<p>So here’s a graph showing the number of public officials charged with corruption since 1980.  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvwzb6NyI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/lufPugrFwhA/s1600-h/Public+Corruption+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvwzb6NyI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/lufPugrFwhA/s320/Public+Corruption+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A few comments.  I suspect part of the increase under Reagan has something to do with the agency being in charge of this being newly formed (in 1976) and just getting up to speed, plus a lot of new responsibilities for election crimes were added in 1980.  Also, arrests could down for several reasons… one is that an administration might be appointing honest people.  Another is that an administration is thoroughly politicized, and simply doesn’t charge as many people since most of the people available for prosecution, especially after a few years, are members of the administration and folks appointed by the administration (i.e., judges).  Then there is incompetence…</p>
<p>So to flesh out the story, let’s also look at the conviction rate…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvrzb6NxI/AAAAAAAAAWI/MaNgcnqzMF4/s1600-h/Public+Corruption+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvrzb6NxI/AAAAAAAAAWI/MaNgcnqzMF4/s320/Public+Corruption+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note… convictions can be over 100% simply by convicting some folks charged in earlier years.</p>
<p>Now some summaries…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvmDb6NwI/AAAAAAAAAWA/RNvAyy0jk1Y/s1600-h/Public+Corruption+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoTvmDb6NwI/AAAAAAAAAWA/RNvAyy0jk1Y/s320/Public+Corruption+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what’s the story line here?  My guess…  Clinton appointed fewer crooks.  Despite the 6 years and 60 million bucks spent fishing for anything they could find, leaving every stone unturned didn’t turn up much against Clinton.  But Iran Contra snagged a bunch of people, and we all knew what was going on, special prosecutor or not.  And the GW administration, well, I don’t think even Laura Bush thinks he’s restored honor and integrity to the White House.</p>
<p>So back to the story…  I think Clinton appointed fewer crooks.  I think he also appointed more competent US Attorneys and DoJ staff, who were also less politically motivated.  Result… a higher conviction rate, and the higher conviction rate also sent a message to potential scofflaws.  </p>
<p>But all things are relative… more competent and less politically motivated doesn’t necessarily mean competent or non-political, merely more competent and less politically motivated than the other guys.  Consider an interesting detail, no doubt a mere coincidence&#8230; There are four years in the sample in which a sitting President runs for re-election.  Three of those…  1984, 1996, and 2004 showed an increase in convictions.  (1980 may follow the same pattern… it appears much bigger than 1981, though we don’t what 1979 looked like.) 1992 did not.    So does an increase in convictions help re-election?  Who knows.  But it may be that the folks running the show think it does.  Presidents smart or tough enough to win re-election might well, in an attempt to leave no stone unturned, manage to clear the docket and up the conviction rate in the year leading up to an election.  With Reagan and Clinton, the numbers are stark.  Even the staff handpicked by Ashcroft, who in turn was handpicked by GW, managed to put a bit of blip into the series.</p>

<blockquote><p>California Republican Party officials might have violated federal immigration law by hiring an Australian immigrant for a top finance post without ever demanding to see his proof of legal residence, immigration officials said Tuesday. </p>
<p>Ron Nehring, who heads the California Republican Party, admitted Tuesday that he &#8212; and as far as he knows, any party officials &#8212; never saw the green card that would prove that Michael Kamburowski, an Australian citizen hired as the state GOP&#8217;s chief operations officer, was a legal resident. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division said Tuesday the law is clear that &#8220;it is the responsibility of the employers to check and see that someone is legally in the country and eligible to work.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Chronicle reported Sunday that Kamburowski &#8212; an Australian immigrant who was hired as the GOP&#8217;s chief operations officer in March to oversee the party&#8217;s multi-million-dollar campaign accounts &#8212; was ordered deported in 2001, later was jailed on visa violations in 2004 and since has filed a $5 million wrongful arrest lawsuit against U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials, according to court documents on file in U.S. District Court. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>The Supreme Court also ruled in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06slipopinion.html"> LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v. PSKS, INC</a> and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/28/news/economy/bc.antitrust.court.reut/index.htm?postversion=2007062811">Reuters</a> has a nice summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday overturned a nearly 100-year-old precedent that some price-setting agreements between manufacturers and retailers are automatically illegal under federal antitrust law.  By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a 1911 Supreme Court ruling that minimum prices set by manufacturers on what dealers can charge customers for their products are unquestionably illegal … Antitrust authorities at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission also had urged the top court to overturn the precedent, while 37 states and a leading consumer group had urged that the precedent be preserved.  The ruling stemmed from an appeal to the Supreme Court by a company called Leegin Creative Leather Products Inc., the manufacturer of the Brighton brand of women&#8217;s accessories.  In 1997, it adopted a policy stating it would do business only with retailers that followed its suggested retail prices and would not sell to retailers that discounted its products.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I should thank our favorite troll, his premise that I don’t care about the underlying issue is just insulting (but what else is new).  His take is that this decision is some victory for economists, which is just stupid.  I guess trolls are not aware of the vast literature on something called resale price maintenance (RPM).  As I searched for a definition of this concept, I came across a really stupid version:</p>
<blockquote><p>These rules prevent resellers from competing too fiercely on price and thus driving down profits. Some argue that the manufacturer may do this because it wishes to keep resellers profitable, and thus keeping the manufacturer profitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>While manufacturers might wish to keep its profits high, it is not clear that the real reason for RPM is to enforce a cartel.  And to suggest the manufacturer cares about the profits of the distributors is bizarre.  An alternative argument why RPM exists is that it overcomes a failure in the market for distributional services by ensuring that distributors who invest in promoting the manufacturer&#8217;s product are able to recoup the additional costs of such promotion in the price they charge consumers.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/resale-price-maintenance.html">Greg Mankiw</a> explains the latter line of thinking. Recently, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117639832329067902-L1Nh6lyR825IE1NFE_43vis6PHo_20080417.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top">WSJ’s Econoblog</a> had a discussion of this litigation from two of the best.</p>

<blockquote><p>the historic bargain had always been taxing inflationary gains but only as realized, rather than accrued. Realized means when the financial asset is sold. Holding an asset that appreciates in value without the need to pay annual income tax is itself a tax advantage. Deferral of said tax until realization is a tax break. Capital gains have enjoyed a reduced rate relative to &#8220;ordinary income&#8221; long before G. Bush arrived in Washington. The Bushies succeeded in knocking the lower rate of 28% even lower, basically to 15%.  On this account, the tax code advantages capital gains relative to dividends and interest, even if all their rates are the same.  For capital income in general, much is sheltered from taxation because it sits in IRAs and 401(k)s, or it figures in more sophisticated (legal) tax avoidance schemes. Meanwhile, at the corporate level interest is deductible to the firm and dividends are not, so that&#8217;s a bias in favor of interest and against dividends. Economists have written papers asking why corporations pay dividends in the first place. The Bushies reduced the rate on dividends, providing some counterweight. It&#8217;s all basically a mess. Simplicity of administration dictates taxing gains as realized without inflation adjustments under uniform rates. A reduced rate is a concession to the inflation impact, though for some time we have had little inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max then endorses a plan from <a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/media/2007/04162007_Fair_Flat_Tax.html">Senator Wyden</a> with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tax &#8217;em all with the same set of rates, let God sort it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’ll bet <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700097.html">Warren Buffet</a> might like the Wyden plan, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/06/mr-buffetts-tax-bill.html">Greg Mankiw</a> goes after Mr. Buffet’s claims with this: </p>
<blockquote><p>Even more striking to me is a fact that Mr Buffett did not emphasize: how low his taxable income is. His income of $46 million represents a mere 0.1 percent of his reported net worth of over $50 billion. That is not an impressive rate of return!</p>
<p>Why is it so low? I can think of at least four possible ways investors like Mr Buffet can keep their taxable income, as opposed to their true income, low:<br />1. They hold stocks that pay minimal dividends. <br />2. They avoid realizing capital gains. <br />3. They hold some of their portfolios in tax-free municipal bonds. <br />4. They give appreciated assets to charity, getting a deduction for the current market value without ever having to realize and pay tax on the capital gain.<br />Notice that raising tax rates, as Mr Buffett seems to want to do, would not much affect any of these tax avoidance strategies. Even if tax rates were raised substantially, the tax savvy Mr Buffet probably wouldn&#8217;t be paying much in taxes as a proportion of his wealth or as a proportion of his true income.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Greg is getting a little personal here, but he has a point and it is the same point Max made.  Tax deferral strategies can really lower one’s effective tax rate.  But what is wrong with taxing all income as it accrues at the same rate? I bet Max could fire back that taxing income when it accrues adds complexity.  Then again – the current system is really complex.  And it does let the very rich – including Mr. Buffett – game the system.  But isn’t these accounting gimmicks what Mr. Buffet was advocating that we abolish?</p>

Rosenberg</a> condemns the Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://scotusblog.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/05-908.pdf">PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week has been a Supreme Court horror show. Today&#8217;s decision, which comes close to overturning Brown vs. The Board of Ed, is about as horrific decision as any the Court has made since Plessy vs. Ferguson.  Hillary Clinton has it exactly right when she says, &#8220;Today, the Court turned its back on the promise of Brown vs. Board of Education that students of different racial backgrounds deserve an opportunity to attend school together. At a time when our nation&#8217;s schools are increasingly resegregating, we should be championing local efforts to pursue integration and reduce racial inequities in schools.&#8221; Instead, the Roberts court is trying to turn the clock back to 1953.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/28/breaking-supreme-court-limits-use-of-race-for-assigning-students-in-public-schools">ThinkProgress</a> has more including much of the strained logic of Chief Justice Roberts.  While Justice Breyers pens “the promise of Brown”, the Chief Justice tries to defend the majority opinion on the basis of Brown.  But Justice Stevens rebuts:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, the Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s make the reasonable assumption that the Chief Justice is not stupid enough to realize what Justices Breyers and Stevens wrote is exactly right.  His feeble attempt to defend this decision must then be seen as sheer mendacity.  Alas – the most dishonest President in my lifetime has appointed a fellow liar to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>

                                <p>I think the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/opinion/20wed1.html?ex=1339992000&#038;en=8fac219cfa3e5153&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">following</a> is a sensible statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would also be more constructive if the United States took responsibility for its part in international imbalances. An undervalued yuan is only one aspect, allowing China to sell its goods cheaply and amass huge savings in the process. Another is the United States’ federal budget deficits &#8211; which result in large part from serial tax cuts &#8211; requiring America to borrow from China and other foreign lenders.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=06&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=hiding_the_trade_deficit_behin">Dean Baker</a> does not:</p>
<blockquote><p>While this argument can be a convenient weapon against the Bush administration deficits, it doesn&#8217;t make a great deal of sense. First, the numbers don&#8217;t add up. We&#8217;re looking at budget deficits of around $250 billion and trade deficits of close to $800 billion. There is no economic theory that will explain how a $250 billion budget deficit can cause an $800 billion trade deficit. (You&#8217;re welcome to add in the $200 billion borrowed from Social Security, and it still does not come close to adding up.) Then we need a mechanism. High budget deficits are supposed to cause high interest rates. But U.S. interest rates are low by historical standards. With inflation around 3.0 percent, we should expect to see an interest rate on the ten-year treasury bill of close to 6.0 percent. Instead, it is just over 5.0 percent.  Of course, the high interest rate is supposed to be what attracts foreign investors to put money in the U.S., which in turn drives up the value of the dollar. This is always the immediate cause of the trade deficit. People buy foreign produced goods at Wal-Mart because they are cheap, not because the U.S. is running a budget deficit.  Anyhow, the NYT should find more legitimate grounds for bashing Bush&#8217;s budget policy. The trade deficit is a first and foremost a dollar problem, requiring a dollar solution (which will not be pretty). It is not a budget deficit problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where do I and Dean disagree?  I would have started with his use of the unified deficit rather than the general fund deficit – but Dean already notes the Social Security surplus.  But I see this more of a comparative static exercise rather than an accounting exercise.  If the move to fiscal irresponsibility lowered national savings, it would tend to lead to higher real interest rates.  But that does not mean that real interest rates would necessarily be double digit or whatever.  After all, we endured a global inward shift of investment demand a few years back.</p>
<p>Is Dean saying that exchange rates are exogenous?  I would hope he would concede that an increase in our national savings rate would tend to devalue the dollar.  OK, certain foreign nations (including China) are basically pegging their currencies to the dollar.  Maybe we would prefer that these nations return to a floating exchange rate policy.  But as long as these nations save more than they investment and we save virtually nothing – we will be running current account deficits with real exchange rate adjusting to insure as much.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Dean Baker comments, which is always appreciated.  His comment reminded me of something that <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/more-cause-and-effect-regarding.html">Kash said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would a cheaper dollar induce higher savings, thus bringing about the needed change to the US&#8217;s savings/investment balance that would reduce the CA deficit? Or would an improvement in US savings cause the dollar to lose value, thus inducing US exports to rise and imports to fall and thereby improving the CA deficit? Obviously, exchange rates and domestic consumption/savings behavior are both jointly and simultaneously determined. But if I had to pick one to be more exogenous, I would vote for savings behavior. I think that the US&#8217;s underlying savings/investment balance has a lot more influence over the dollar exchange rate than the other way around. Dean suggests the opposite, and specifically argues that because the weak yuan has entailed the Chinese central bank buying lots of dollars, the Chinese exchange rate policy has effectively kept interest rates low in the US, which in turn has depressed savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>On this one – I agree with Kash.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at homicide rates over time, and as a bonus I’ll throw in a relationship between murders and guns.  So here’s the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/tables/totalstab.htm">homicide rate</a> going back to the Ike administration, courtesy of the FBI.</p>
<p>It seems that early in the sample, the homicide rate rose.  It bounced around until the Clinton administration, and then dropped, before bottoming out in the GW administration.  (There’s my Bush Derangement Syndrome again!)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOtEjb6NvI/AAAAAAAAAV4/lS_oH3mJ-oE/s1600-h/Homicide+rate,+graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOtEjb6NvI/AAAAAAAAAV4/lS_oH3mJ-oE/s320/Homicide+rate,+graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOs7Db6NuI/AAAAAAAAAVw/-FLgF9K9xYg/s1600-h/homicide+rate,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOs7Db6NuI/AAAAAAAAAVw/-FLgF9K9xYg/s320/homicide+rate,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clinton did best, followed by Reagan, and (so far) GW.  Carter and LBJ/JFK did the worst.  Hmmmm…  seems to resemble the pattern of spending on administering justice from my post yesterday…  So let’s see what the data says…. </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOsrjb6NtI/AAAAAAAAAVo/PlWSxd_9SX0/s1600-h/homicide+rate,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOsrjb6NtI/AAAAAAAAAVo/PlWSxd_9SX0/s320/homicide+rate,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Table 3 above seems to indicate that the spending on justice is inversely correlated with the murder rate.  More prevention and enforcement, and more punishment = less crime.   (Note&#8230; from the graph, I would guess this relationship may not hold for the entire period&#8230; there&#8217;s probably a structural break somewhere around the Carter era.)  But it doesn’t seem that either pattern particularly leads the other.  In other words&#8230; crime doesn&#8217;t have a memory, and neither does enforcement.  It seems that if you want to cut the crime rate&#8230;  then spend money on enforcement now.</p>
<p>Now… what about guns?  Well, we all heard the adage… guns don’t kill people, people kill people.  So obviously guns have nothing to do with the murder rate.  But I’m a skeptic.  I check anything I can.  So I went looking for data on guns.  Wow… if there’s something hard to find, its time series data on gun ownership from a reputable source.  My guess… the gun lobby really, truly doesn’t believe its own story-line, because if they did they’d make sure this data was out there.  But I digress… lack of data, so I have to call it quits, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not.  It occurs to me that to increase the number of guns out there, someone has to make and sell those guns, because as we all know from school, the gun fairy died after having been sat on by a tapir in 1808.  So… why not find data on how well gun companies are doing?  But what if they’re doing well because they’re selling a lot of guns abroad, or to the military?  Problem.  So I sniffed around, looking for a company that doesn’t rely much on sales to the military or to any of them (God forbid!) foreigners.  And I stumbled on Sturm Ruger &#038; Co Inc.  From their <a href="http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?dcn=0000950123-07-003217&#038;Type=HTML">2005 10-K</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Company’s design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States. Substantially all sales are domestic&#8230; The Company’s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sporting market… yup, that’s the euphemism I’m looking for.  Excellent.  I note that law enforcement types will sometimes buy their guns as well, but its not their main market.  And it won’t matter, as we will see below.</p>
<p>As my measure of how well the company is doing, I went with stock price &#8211; its easiest to pull.  But the price could rise or fall with the market.  So I took the price divided by the S&#038;P 500.  And the price I used was the adjusted price (courtesy of Yahoo’s finance page) – to take into account dividends and buybacks and whatnot of both Sturm, Ruger &#038; Co and the S&#038;P 500.  Additionally, because the homicide rate is yearly, I used the ratio of Sturm, Ruger &#038; Co adjusted close to S&#038;P 500 adjusted close for the last trading day of the year.  Note&#8230; data only goes back to 1990.</p>
<p>Table 3 below shows the correlation.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOsjjb6NsI/AAAAAAAAAVg/lV0eXYIlGdI/s1600-h/homicide+rate,+table+3.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoOsjjb6NsI/AAAAAAAAAVg/lV0eXYIlGdI/s320/homicide+rate,+table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Unless I made a mistake somewhere (and I did this in quite a hurry so if anyone feels an urge to check it please do), it seems there’s a positive correlation between how good of an investment Sturm, Ruger &#038; Co. stock has turned out to be in a given year and the murder rate.  How surprising.  And there’s a much stronger positive correlation between how good of an investment Sturm, Ruger &#038; Co stock has turned out to be the previous year and this year’s murder rate.  Put another way… the more guns being sold, the more murders get committed the next year. </p>
<p>I can’t possibly imagine how this might be.  Wait, wait… let me think. Hmmmm&#8230;  If we multiply by seven and carry the two&#8230; perhaps take a cube root and&#8230; Eureka!  Its so obvious! Law abiding gun buyers can see the future.  When they (including a few law enforcement types) realize the world is about to get more dangerous, they stock up on guns, not to mention the super duper high margin t-shirts, key chains and water bottles that purveyors of fine weaponry like Sturm, Ruger and its competitors manufacture and sell!  Simple, really.  Why the gun lobby doesn’t want this kind of data out there I have no idea.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Next Presidential comparison&#8230;  arrests and convictions of public officials for corruption.  Note&#8230; this isn&#8217;t quite the data I was looking for&#8230; it includes judges and others that are not quite administration members.  If anyone has a pointer for members of each administration that were arrested and/or convicted please let me know.</p>
<p>And one more plea for data&#8230;  data on guns is really hard to find.  Anyone have a link to a credible source showing gun ownership or gun sales?</p>

                                <p>Let’s have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg26jun26,0,7107921.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Jonah</a> speak for himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do I like Dick Cheney? Because at a time when everybody talks a big game about how they don&#8217;t like people-pleasing politicians who live by the polls, Cheney is pretty much the only guy out there who walks the walk. He truly doesn&#8217;t care what people think about him. I love that … In particular, I like his stance toward the media. His view of the Fourth Estate is a bit like that of a bull elephant annoyed by varmints shnuffling around his feet: He&#8217;s not bothered enough to squish &#8217;em</p></blockquote>
<p>Such STUPID writing.  The word is not squish – the word is LIE.  Now I’m not surprised that Mr. Goldberg loves someone who lies.  After all, what does the National Review do on a routine basis?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, Cheney&#8217;s approach to government is ultimately counterproductive. That&#8217;s certainly the upshot of an epic exegesis on Cheney&#8217;s tenure that is unfolding like daily Pulitzer bait in the Washington Post this week. So far, the image of the VPOTUS emerging in the series is one of almost cinematic villainy. Like Cancer Man in &#8220;The X-Files,&#8221; he always seems to be standing in the shadows, moving the gears of government to his own nefarious tune. According to the Post, he even intimidated former Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft — who, we all know, smells of sulfur and eats puppies like popcorn — into abandoning his objections to harsh treatment of enemy combatants. The vice president is famously concerned with two things: restoring the prerogatives of the executive branch, lost in the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate, and defeating our enemies in the war on terror. Both are admirable goals. But seemingly countless sources inside the Bush administration tell the Post that he has a contempt for bureaucratic and legislative consensus-building that rivals his contempt for cultivating public support through the media. As a result, he often succeeds in bulldozing policies — on enemy interrogations, etc. — all the way to the president&#8217;s desk. But he&#8217;s isolated when it comes time to defend these policies in Congress and the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now this is just STUPID analysis. It’s not that the isolation has made it difficult for Cheney to defend good decisions.  Rather – it’s that Cheney is making really bad decisions as he ignores input from those who might actually understand things like how the economy works or what is good foreign policy in the Middle East.  But then again – those who write for the National Review routinely ignore what the experts are saying and they write some of the dumbest things I’ve ever read.  Mr. Goldberg babbles on about Cheney’s “principled arguments”.  But I never heard anything of principle come out of Cheney’s mouth – only dishonesty and/or stupidity.. But that is why Jonan Goldberg hears Dick Cheney – they are a lot of like.</p>
<p>Memo to my home town newspaper – you are better than the National Review so why on earth do you soil your pages with the incessant idiocy of Jonah Goldberg?</p>
