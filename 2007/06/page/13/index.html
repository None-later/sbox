                                <p>Some days ago, I had a post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/capture-theory-mad-cow-bush.html">on Capture Theory</a>.  One of hilzoy&#8217;s readers at Obsidian Wings notices a problems with the AP story on which my post was based, and <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2007/06/retraction.html">hilzoy follows up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>in short: the government argues that since tests for BSE only pick up the disease a few months before an animal becomes symptomatic, a point which is usually well after most US cattle are slaughtered, testing would miss most infected animals. It would, essentially, be a marketing gimmick designed to produce unfounded confidence&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more at Obsidian Wings, and well worth a read.  If the administration&#8217;s position is accurate, there may well be more to this story than capture theory.  Is it accurate?</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall my comments here and there that lately I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work involving satellites.  So the start of <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11017.html">Steve Benen&#8217;s latest post</a> was no surprise to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The available evidence overwhelmingly suggests the global warming is a burgeoning environmental crisis. The Bush administration has decided to take action — it wants to collect less evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its worth a read.  Its also worth a compare and contrast with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/triana.html">my own recent post about Triana</a>.</p>

                                <p>I was wondering if Fred Thompson would adopt a more honest fiscal policy message than we have heard from Rudy McRomney.  The Siamese triplet known that I have called <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-clueless-is-rudy-giuliani.html">Rudy McRomney</a> (OK – someone else coined this term) wants you to believe we can return to fiscal responsibility without tax increases even though it wants us to increase defense spending.  It’s the usual free lunch nonsense we hear from the likes of <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/RobertDNovak/2007/06/02/rudys_jersey_coup&#038;Comments=true">Robert Novak</a> who has some news for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lawrence Lindsey, George W. Bush&#8217;s issues adviser in the 1999-2000 run-up to his presidential candidacy, is poised to play a similar role in Fred Thompson&#8217;s imminent campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just lovely.  Lindsey preached his brand of free lunch economics to both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  On foreign policy, it’s vote Republican or die.  On fiscal policy, it’s vote Republican because we lie to you.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/06/thompsons-economist.html">Greg Mankiw</a> has some nice things to say about Lawrence Lindsey but he also adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of my Harvard colleagues get annoyed when they see descriptions such as Novak&#8217;s. Larry was never a full professor at Harvard, which is a tenured position; he was an assistant professor, and perhaps an associate professor, which are untenured positions. As one of my senior colleagues put it to me, &#8220;If someone was a vice president of a bank, would it be accurate to report that he was president of the bank?&#8221; My own view is that the hierarchical distinctions of academic rank do not loom large in the minds of people outside the academy, so Novak&#8217;s small degree of sloppiness here is fully excusable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess some would say it is not excusable for a real reporter to be this sloppy, but then I never confused Robert Novak as being a real reporter.</p>

                                <p>Kurdistan seems to be relatively peaceful.  Kurdistan seems to be more or less ethnically homogenous, and it ran itself (under US protection) for years while Saddam was still a threat.  That&#8217;s the sort of situation that provides both time and incentive for a well-functioning government to evolve.  Sadly, most of Iraq is not Kurdistan, which seems to be .  </p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/world/middleeast/04surge.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this story</a> in several places&#8230; I&#8217;m running late and I don&#8217;t know which blog to credit for the pointer (either Matthew Yglesias or the Carpetbagger).  The story indicates the surge is (predictably) not working in Baghdad.</p>
<p>I noted before the surge began a few months ago that it wasn&#8217;t going to work.  I noted that I hoped (yet again) that the administration would prove me wrong and do somethign well, but it has stubbornly refused to do so on anything important for six years and change now.  At this point, its been slowly sinking in with the Republican base that maybe the problem is with the Administration.  But at this point, so what?   Realizing an obvious problem long after every opportunity to fix (I would guess the 2006 Congressional election was the last chance) it is gone neither takes any insight, nor is it particularly useful.</p>
<p>The signs have been there for a long time&#8230; the frantically moving goalposts (both on Iraq and the economy &#8211; when is that debt going to be paid off again?), the treatment of those that didn&#8217;t drink the Kool-Aid, the allies jumping ship.  So what can be done to prevent this sort of widespread realization occuring, too late, the next time around?</p>

                                <p>This post was sent by reader Edward Charles Ponzi Jr.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Is this correct use of language and economic concepts?</p>
<p>“My house has appreciated 20% this year”</p>
<p>“Due to inflation steak is much more than years ago”</p>
<p>“Prices have not gone up – so there is zero inflation”</p>
<p>I find much of the discussion about inflation – even by people with an economics background &#8212; to revolve around very fuzzy concepts. While there may be some understanding – in the general population and elsewhere &#8212; that inflation is an observable phenomena with some sort of “cause” &#8212; all sorts of price distortions are taken for granted while others are not.</p>
<p>Even “zero inflation” needs examination – if I buy an American made t-shirt for $8 in 1999 and then buy a Chinese made t-shirt in 2007 – also for $8 – that indicates what exactly? </p>
<p>In fact, all of our Economic Metrics are distorted by the growth of monetary and credit aggregates – to the point where intelligent people believe that the economy is growing, that they are getting wealthier and that they may borrow against certain apparent value. </p>
<p>What if those people are wrong? What if a “growing” GDP and a “rising” stock market are simply inflation – plain and simple – and the adjustment to factor inflation out was mis-applied? And why is a hot-dog that increases in price considered “inflation” while a house that increases in price is “appreciation”? Why is my hot-dog not “appreciating?” Maybe I should buy and bunch and freeze them. That would make them an “investment”.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest problems in today’s economic landscape is how popular credit expansion and its cousin asset inflation have become. Firstly, we have been convinced that “inflation” does not apply to assets at all (ask around and see how many people can use “asset inflation” in a sentence) – and have further created a society where everyone wants interest rates to be lower. </p>
<p>Savers and debtors are united in their desire for low interest rates – one for obvious reasons and the other because they find asset inflation more fun than bond trading. Liberal economists criticize the Fed for raising interest rates – feeling that employment will suffer – and Conservative economists are worried about stock prices. </p>
<p>Who will EVER be for a higher interest rate? Who will ever want to tap the brakes? Who will ever want a little recession? </p>
<p>The problem is that the price of assets is somewhat pegged to the cost of money. With lots of people able to carry $650/month – it is easy to see how homes in this example could go up 40%.</p>
<p>Monthly payment: 30 Years, Interest rate: 6.750% Loan amount: $ 100,000.00 </p>
<p>$ 648.60 a month </p>
<p>Monthly payment: 30 Years, Interest rate: 3.750% Loan amount: $ 140,000.00 </p>
<p>$ 648.36 a month </p>
<p>For Mr. Homeowner, whose home has just gone up 40% &#8212; what does he think and how is he going to behave from now on? That extra $40K may have been more than he saved in 10 years of working. Why save? The Smart Money – he figures – is borrowing and buying. </p>
<p>Why bother with the Real Economy and its Income Model at all? Why not build your economic life on the multipliers available with the Asset Model? Borrow money, buy something and combine the increasing value of the asset with the decreasing value of the money you are paying back. Think about how many people people are doing that at scales large and small. </p>
<p>Unfortunately you can MAKE MONEY in the Asset Inflation Game &#8212; but you cannot build a viable economy by having an entire nation seeking Capital Gains. Asset inflation is not a wealth creation process – it is a re-pricing process. The Homeowner that watches his home go from $100K to $140K has not created any new houses. He still has 42,000 pounds of bricks, tons of sheetrock, roofing and some copper. Why does he think he is “wealthier”? </p>
<p>Wealth is STUFF. It is not little green pieces of paper. Wealth is washers, dryers, telephones, songs, cans of tuna fish, software, inductors, grand pianos, patents and iron filings. </p>
<p>We are now well along in this process. The amount of money borrowed against the worlds assets – at various valuations – is staggering. In all cases growth is assumed as part of the payoff plan – and in many cases observed “growth” may only be inflation or distortion. Our current metrics give us no clue as to how much trouble we are really in. Are we really twice as wealthy as half-a-GDP-ago? I think not. We are sitting in a house of mirrors measuring our bodies by sight.</p>
<p>One of the core goals of my Futurist-Project-Under-Construction is to develop some Mew Metrics that will allow a more rational view of our irrational world.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a follow up to my post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">real gdp per capita while trying to take into recessions</a>.  </p>
<p>Recall &#8211; I tried to account for recessions because our friends on the right (plus one very annoying troll) felt recessions skewed things.  I personally disagree &#8211; as I noted, among other problems with this idea, a President with lousy economic policy is more likely to have a recession, more likely to prolong it, and more likely to make it worse than a President with better economic policies.  But I decided to try anyway.  In that post, I looked at real GDP per capita, and I ignored any increases in debt, as that makes Republicans look bad.  I also removed the 8 quarters following a recession &#8211; my assumption was that, because the GW administration keeps talking about how things have gone since Q3 of 2003, about 2 years after the last recession (so far) ended, that a lag time might be needed.</p>
<p>Several readers have voiced the opinion that the 2 year lag should come out.  So here are the results with the 2 lag removed.  (I&#8217;ve improved the table since the previous post&#8230;  it now shows the weighted (by quarter) average growth rates for each President and for each party.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmSLBCSzEJI/AAAAAAAAAOw/-53UagXeoaU/s1600-h/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+3.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmSLBCSzEJI/AAAAAAAAAOw/-53UagXeoaU/s320/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what changed?  Now, we show JFK/LBJ at the top, followed by Reagan.  Nixon/Ford and Carter are essentially tied at 0.71% growth per quarter &#8211; Nixon/Ford win out at the third significant digit.  Then Clnton.  Then Bush.  Then GHW.  Then Ike.  </p>
<p>As before, Americans spend more time in recession when Republicans are in office than when Democrats are in office (76.47% v. 93.75%).  Despite that, leaving out the recessionary periods, growth is still faster, on average, under Democrats than under Republicans, 0.70% versus 0.43%.  </p>
<p>And its not a matter of out a laggard.  Leaving out Ike, the Republican growth rate is 0.62% per quarter.  Leaving out both Ike and GHW, its 0.67%.</p>
<p>End result&#8230; if you pick a series that doesn&#8217;t account for debt, and you leave out recessions that may have been caused by the guy in office, and you ignore the story line the GW administration is peddling, you can show that Republicans underperformance on the economy is not quite as bad as if you do none of these things.  </p>
<p>I hope we can reach the following conclusions&#8230; <br />1.  the economy does not perform as well when the President is a Republican than when the President is a Democrat<br />2.  The difference is not due to<br />
<blockquote>a.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_16.html">Congress</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>b.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/democrats-republicans-and-lags.html">Lags</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>c.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">Cherry picking series</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>d.  The business cycle</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>e.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">the Fed</a>, which in fact seems to favor Republicans</p></blockquote>
<p>So what&#8217;s left?  From what I can tell, what&#8217;s left is policy or coincidence.  And given the number of series I&#8217;ve looked at so far, the coincidence explanation seems to be somewhat frayed.  And I realize to some, the idea that policy is the explanation is unpleasant.  Which brings us to Arthur Conan Doyle and the words he wrote for Sherlock Holmes:  &#8220;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbably, must be the truth.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know we&#8217;re no fans of corruption by either party at Angry Bear.  We&#8217;ve had a few posts calling for the indictment of William Jefferson.  And now <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070604/ap_on_go_co/congressman_probe">it happened</a>.  Now its up to the legal system.  Hopefully he&#8217;ll be treated fairly, and if he&#8217;s as guilty as I believe he is, I hope he serves a long, long sentence.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s hoping a whole bunch of other indictments follow along soon, and may they all rot in jail if guilty.  My money is on Rep Jerry Lewis next.  </p>
<p>I recall Steve Benen had a list of congresscritters and admin types under investigation by the FBI.  Anyone have an updated list?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011421.php">Kevin Drum</a> links to a piece by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0706.ackerman.html">Spencer Ackerman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>Haunted by Vietnam, Democrats are determined to express support for the troops. This is admirable. The truth of the matter, however, is this: many troops in Iraq, perhaps even most of them, want to stay and fight.</p>
<p>&#8230;.Democrats have made the decision — rightly, I think — that withdrawing from Iraq is the least bad of many bad options. But they shouldn&#8217;t kid themselves into thinking that a majority of the troops doing the fighting agree with them. For soldiers like Lieutenant Wellman, this will be hard to accept. As he told me of war doubters back home, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to just support the troops. I want them to support the mission.&#8221; This matters, because pretending that in ending the war they&#8217;re doing the troops a favor hurts Democrats politically. They risk looking condescending, and, worse, oblivious — which has the broader effect of undermining public trust in the Democrats to handle national security. More basically, it does a disservice to those who serve. For soldiers who are optimistic, being told that the war can&#8217;t be won is bad enough. But to be told that politicians are doing them a favor by extricating them from a mission they believe in is downright insulting.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is God&#8217;s own truth. Ditto for the Democratic obsession with using better body armor, higher GI pay, or the quality of military medical care as proxies for &#8220;supporting the troops.&#8221; As with leaving Iraq, these are all good things to support. But they&#8217;re good things on their own terms, not because anyone in uniform will be fooled into thinking that voting for them means you support the military. It&#8217;s the equivalent of Democrats who thought that John Kerry had automatic credibility on national security just because he was a Vietnam vet.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect they&#8217;re right.  But I also think this is no different than getting criticized for reading <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">GW&#8217;s Economic Blueprint</a> in early 2001 and concluding its unadulterated BS.  Sure, I hoped GW was going to pay down the debt as promised, and I was willing to give him a chance to prove me wrong, but damn if it wasn&#8217;t obvious his silly &#8220;plan&#8221; wasn&#8217;t going to work.  And it has since failed miserably despite them putting the goalposts on a flatbed truck and chasing the ball around.</p>
<p>And this is something I noted a long time ago in the corporate world.  At one point, I was lucky enough to report to one of the most competent and intelligent individuals I&#8217;ve ever met.  And I always wondered why he had never quite made it to the top rungs of the company.  Eventually I realized, you can be wrong all the time, as long as everyone above you on the totem pole is also wrong.  But being right when everyone above you is wrong&#8230; well, that&#8217;s something you can do once, maybe twice, before you get in a heck of a lot of trouble.</p>

One off-line comment I did receive off-line disputed something I wrote.  In particular, the Ex-GF took issue with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;our resident troll, whom we share with Maxspeak&#8230; And I note that in my opinion, we (And Maxspeak) were shortchanged in the troll department. The folks who assign trolls clearly sent us what can only be charitable described as one of the lesser trolls. I doubt he even graduated from troll school, much less achieved certification.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ex-GF told me that since the troll manages now again has managed to get me and PGL to not just respond in comments, but to write entire posts, he clearly is succeeding and troll-dom, at least with us.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines a troll <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">thusly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Internet terminology, a troll is someone who intentionally posts derogatory or otherwise inflammatory messages about sensitive topics in an established online community such as an online discussion forum to bait users into responding.</p></blockquote>
<p>By that definition, our troll then is quite successful.  But it occurs to me that his attempts fail in another regard.  When we analyze what the troll writes, we invariably show it to be, well, stupid.  Results are never what the troll expects, and in fact, if anything, make his cause look worse.  And in several instances, have led us (or at least me) to ideas for posts that we (or at least I) would never have considered.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  is the Ex-GF right?  Am I?  Is our troll successful?  Is he good at trolling?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan continues mulling over what Bob Hormats wrote&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Rather than define terrorism itself, which appears to have many forms, goals and objectives, and methods, I have found several responses to the ‘war on terror’ to be more manageable and in line with our recent experience with Mr. Hormats and current media coverage.</p>
<p>Several proposals emerged that subsumed different assumptions about the nature of terrorism.</p>
<p>An increasingly sophisticated enemy and wmd oriented against the US, and possibly state sponsored at least indirectly. Beef up US Special Forces etc.<br />Not an increasing threat but scattered and few relative to massive responses so wait and see.<br />An increasingly decentralized and well-funded groups using ultra modern communications and organized to disrupt centralized states. Changed from more traditional terrorists in occupying territory. One response is to decentralize our infrastructure instead of bigger forces.<br />Creation of counter forces like Blackwater to be nimble enough to counter threats and avoids the limitations of national forces.</p>
<p>Number one is <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB202/index1.html">the Rand Corporation PAF briefing report</a> which states that the global jihadist movement is the biggest challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the U.S.-led global war on terrorism has had some notable successes — such as the destruction of al-Qaeda’s sanctuary in Afghanistan, the elimination of many of the group’s leaders, and the growing resolve of many countries to take action against al-Qaeda and its associates — no informed observers believe that al-Qaeda will be eradicated any time soon. Indeed, in some respects, al-Qaeda has metastasized into an even more formidable adversary, dispersed across the world, largely self-sustaining, and constantly adopting new and innovative tactics. The United States itself continues to be threatened by large-scale attacks. Thus, countering al-Qaeda is likely to preoccupy U.S. national security institutions for at least the remainder of this decade, and probably longer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Number two is<br /><a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901facomment85501-p10/john-mueller/is-there-still-a-terrorist-threat-the-myth-of-the-omnipresent-enemy.html">this point of view, posited by John Mueller</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the first page of its founding manifesto, the massively funded Department of Homeland Security intones, &#8220;Today&#8217;s terrorists can strike at any place, at any time, and with virtually any weapon.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Given the monumental imperfection of the government&#8217;s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the debacle of FBI and National Security Agency programs to upgrade their computers to better coordinate intelligence information, that explanation seems far-fetched. Moreover, Israel still experiences terrorism even with a far more extensive security apparatus</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>It was in 2003 that al Qaeda&#8217;s top leaders promised attacks in Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Yemen. Three years later, some bombs had gone off in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, and Jordan (as well as in the unlisted Turkey) but not in any other of the explicitly threatened countries. Those attacks were tragic, but their sparseness could be taken as evidence that it is not only American alarmists who are given to extravagant huffing and puffing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Number three&#8230; <a href="http://www.d-n-i.net/fcs/robb_opensource_war.htm">John Robb has a different point of view</a> in his article and subsequent book Brave New War, which suggests terrorism has evolved into sort of open source, loosely networked and de-centralized groups of people who learn from each other and are organized to disrupt centralized economies and governments…</p>
<blockquote><p>that the insurgency isn&#8217;t a fragile hierarchical organization but rather a resilient network made up of small, autonomous groups. This means that the insurgency is virtually immune to attrition and decapitation. It will combine and recombine to form a viable network despite high rates of attrition. Body counts &#8211; and the military should already know this &#8211; aren&#8217;t a good predictor of success. </p></blockquote>
<p>David Brooks remarks on Robb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Superempowered global guerrillas — whether it’s Al Qaeda, Iraqi insurgents, Nigerian oil fighters or the Brazilian gang P.C.C. — specialize in what Robb calls systems disruption. They attack the networks that support modern life. In one case, Iraqi insurgents spent roughly $2,000 to blow up an oil pipeline in Southeast Iraq. It cost the Iraqi government $500 million in lost revenue. For the insurgents, that was a return on investment of 25 million percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>The 9/11 attacks, the Madrid bombings, the Niger Delta oil well attacks and even the Samarra mosque bombing were all attempts to disrupt the economic and social systems of target nations.</p>
<p>Number four, from <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=121606A">Tech Central Station</a>, positing stateless fighting forces for hire, good and bad guys:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stateless warfighting organizations are all the rage these days. From Al Qaeda to Blackwater, they come in all shapes and sizes and pursue all varieties of ends. Consider: Al Qaeda is an organization funded by a Saudi tycoon&#8217;s heir, and exists to pursue strategies that are wholly outside the realm of policies of any given state. Indeed, it seeks to topple the governments of many states in the Middle East, from which it draws many of its recruits and funding.</p>
<p>(Other names in describing terrorism Zakaria, Huntington, Fukuyama, Barnet are useful for older forms of terrorism that we are used to thinking about)</p></blockquote>
<p>I also note that this description has no punch and would not be useful for marketing or framing the ‘war on terror’.</p>
