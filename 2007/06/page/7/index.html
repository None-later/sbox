                                <p>I’m about three weeks late with this, but Ron Paul is such a delight when it comes to keeping folks like Rudy Giuliani from getting away with dishonest fear mongering.  <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters?pid=195576">John Nichols</a> reminds us of the GOP debate last month and the dust up between Rudy Giuliani and Ron Paul:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rudy Giuliani made clear in Tuesday night&#8217;s Republican presidential debate that he is not ready to let the facts get in the way of his approach to foreign policy.  The most heated moment in the debate, which aired live on the conservative Fox News network, came when the former New York mayor and current GOP front-runner angrily refused to entertain a serious discussion about the role that actions taken by the United States prior to the September 11, 2OO1, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon may have played in inspiring or encouraging those attacks. Giuliani led the crowd of contenders on attacking Texas Congressman Ron Paul after the anti-war Republican restated facts that are outlined in the report of the The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States … The mayor, who is making his response to the 9-11 attacks on New York a central feature of his presidential campaign, was joined in the assault on Paul by many of the other candidates. But congressman did not back down, and for good reason. Unlike Giuliani, the Texan has actually read the record. The 9-11 Commission report detailed how bin Laden had, in 1996, issued &#8220;his self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia&#8221; and identified that declaration and another in 1998 as part of &#8220;a long series&#8221; of statements objecting to U.S. military interventions in his native Saudi Arabia in particular and the Middle East in general. Statements from bin Laden and those associated with him prior to 9-11 consistently expressed anger with the U.S. military presence on the Arabian Peninsula, U.S. aggression against the Iraqi people and U.S. support of Israel.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N24342743.htm">Andy Sullivan</a> shows that Ron Paul followed up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Longshot Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul on Thursday gave front-runner Rudy Giuliani a list of foreign-policy books to back up his contention that attacks by Islamic militants are fueled by the U.S. presence in the Middle East. &#8220;I&#8217;m giving Mr. Giuliani a reading assignment,&#8221; the nine-term Texas congressman said as he stood behind a stack of books that included the report by the commission that examined the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have used fear mongering and lying to the American people to put their reelection strategy ahead of a rational foreign policy.  I guess Rudy is a lot like them.  Of course, the press can’t be bothered with this.</p>
<p>But I hope the press does not ignore two other matters.  One is the indictment of his South Carolina campaign chief for <a href="http://www.thestate.com/136/story/96446.html">selling cocaine</a>.  The larger problem is Rudy’s decision to skip meeting of the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11174.html">Iraq Study Group</a>.  As Steve Benen notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure, it was a mistake to join the group and then fail to do any work. And sure it’s not exactly encouraging to see a presidential candidate prefer cashing in to meaningful public service on the nation’s most pressing crisis.  But looking beyond this, Giuliani should have stayed with the ISG so he could learn what the hell he’s talking about.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzQ2MjZkOGY5OGFkNzE1OTA0ZWQxNTZlNTg4NmE3NWU=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is happy to post Rudy’s reply with respect to the Iraq Study Group snub:</p>
<blockquote><p>As someone considered a potential presidential candidate, the Mayor didn’t want the group’s work to become a political football.  That, coupled with time restraints led to his decision.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Jonah was too lazy to check the facts so we have to rely on <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/19/rudys_justification_for_leaving_iraq_study_group_shown_to_be_bogus">Greg Sargent</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So very clearly, Rudy himself was saying that he was a &#8220;potential Presidential candidate&#8221; five months before agreeing to join the ISG. He even openly stated that he&#8217;d be actively considering a run during the same year &#8211; 2006 &#8211; that the ISG would be doing its work. So why did Rudy join it in the first place? His campaign is now saying that he backed out of his ISG commitment because the fact that he was seen as a potential candidate could politicize his work for the panel &#8211; even though that didn&#8217;t stop him from signing up in the first place.  This is just total bull, pure and simple. No polite way to describe it.   Meanwhile, the only remaining piece of his pushback &#8211; that &#8220;time constraints&#8221; prevented his participation &#8211; actually confirms the story. So Rudy&#8217;s got nothing left here.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at the change in proportion of children living in two parent households over time. I think most of us can agree that in most circumstances, it is better for children to live in circumstances that include both their parents, and this is certainly a big issue with the right in the US. Data on the proportion of children living with both parents is available from <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/hh-fam/ch1.xls">the Census</a>. </p>
<p>Here’s a picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGlJumkcI/AAAAAAAAATA/ixQTo3Lbc2A/s1600-h/Children+living+with+2+parents,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGlJumkcI/AAAAAAAAATA/ixQTo3Lbc2A/s320/Children+living+with+2+parents,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note… according to the footnote, beginning in 1982, improved methods for collecting data began to be used. Here’s a summary… because of the structural break, Reagan’s figures only include 1982 – 1988, but I include Reagan’s entire term also at the bottom of the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGfpumkbI/AAAAAAAAAS4/_GkFWUGZFMA/s1600-h/Children+living+with+2+parents,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGfpumkbI/AAAAAAAAAS4/_GkFWUGZFMA/s320/Children+living+with+2+parents,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Is the data before and after the structural break comparable? I don&#8217;t know. My guess is that yes&#8230; the structural break takes the form of a one-time bump in the data, but the trends would be no different without the break in the data. Either way, it seems Carter did poorly, but the other two Dems did better than Reps (either in their half of the sample or in the whole sample). </p>
<p>Here’s something interesting. As we saw in an earlier post, there really wasn’t Welfare Reform may not have done anything positive (and probably did some damage) to the cause of marriage. But… there is an improvement in the percentage of children living with both parents from 1996 to 2000. So what is going on? Is the Welfare Reform Act hurting marriages and helping children? My guess… not. My guess is that once again, increases in income have a positive effect on the rate of children living in two parent households that swamped any effect in the Welfare Reform Act. (As noted in the earlier post… real median income rose much more quickly than normal (for the post WW2 era) from 1996 to 2000.) Note that whatever improvements were observed from 1996 to 2000 reversed after 2000, when real median income also began a reverse.</p>
<p>So… below I put in a couple of tables looking at the correlation between the rate of change of the percentage of children living in two parent homes and the rate of change in several other factors: income, real GDP per capita, and the divorce rate. I don’t expect real GDP per capita to matter … but I’ve been asked why in some recent posts I’ve been looking at real median income rather than real GDP per capita… </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGaJumkaI/AAAAAAAAASw/J1cfT4J3glY/s1600-h/Children+living+with+2+parents,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnfGaJumkaI/AAAAAAAAASw/J1cfT4J3glY/s320/Children+living+with+2+parents,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What do we see? Well, real median incomes matter, and a heck of a lot more than real GDP per capita when having a decision whether or not keep a family together. So my speculation earlier about the uselessness (at best) of the Welfare Reform Act in this regard may well be correct. </p>
<p>As to divorce, obviously, it matters a lot. Interestingly, it seems (and the data bounces around a lot so its hard to say) but divorces that happened years earlier can affect the % change in the fraction of children living with two parents. Perhaps a woman that has been divorced in the past is more likely to have a child outside of marriage in the future? </p>
<p>Given this post was on families staying together for the benefit of children, I’ll have a post soon on the decision to have children.</p>

<p>Anyway, to begin, I’m nobody special. Regular readers may recall that I’m a consultant. I do a lot of statistical work for which the end user is the military or NASA, and some business analytics / strategy work for private companies. I’m trying to up the latter as much as possible. </p>
<p>The Ex-GF has been helping me put up a <a href="http://www.analyticecon.com/">new website</a> which gives a bit better description of what I do. (Pretty good domain name, eh? I guess someone let it lapse.) I usually operate solo, but I also work with some other consulting firms when I have something that’s too big for me alone. </p>
<p>OK. So… what do I do to get more private sector business? I find I’m pretty good at marketing, but not so good at marketing myself. I’m not even that great at getting myself in front of the right people. What do I need to do different? Comments, suggestions, contributions, donations, referrals, projects, are all welcome.</p>

<p>New reports are of concern. Is this hype, cowardice, welfare cheating, the decline of the American soldier, or something about the nature of current conflicts and the military structure?</p>
<p>PTSD Part 2</p>
<p>U.S. troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061401643.html?hpid=topnews">&#8220;daunting and growing&#8221; psychological problems</a> &#8212; with nearly 40 percent of soldiers, a third of Marines and half of the National Guard members reporting symptoms &#8212; but the military&#8217;s cadre of mental-health workers is &#8220;woefully inadequate&#8221; to meet their needs, a Pentagon task force reported yesterday.</p>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>The task force found that 38 percent of soldiers, 31 percent of Marines, 49 percent of Army National Guard members and 43 percent of Marine reservists reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression or other problems, according to military surveys completed this year by service members 90 and 120 days after returning from deployments.</p>
<p>Two &#8220;signature injuries&#8221; from Iraq and Afghanistan are PTSD and traumatic brain injury, it said. Symptoms include nightmares and other sleep problems, trouble concentrating, anger, recklessness, and self-medication with drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>The task force identified several barriers to care, including the stigma associated with seeking help, poor access to providers and facilities, and disruptions in care as service members move locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stigma in the military remains pervasive and often prevents service members from seeking needed care,&#8221; the report said, citing anonymous surveys that show most members with symptoms of mental health problems do not seek help.</p>
<p>Some soldiers underreport problems because they want to stay with their units, and military officials note that many soldiers undergoing treatment for stress or other mental problems are allowed to deploy again after a screening to determine the intensity of their symptoms or depending on what medications they are taking. Those on lithium, for example, should not deploy while those on another class of medications similar to Prozac may be able to, said Army Col. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, who assisted the task force.</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote><p>National Guard and reserve members &#8212; who often live far from military bases and return from deployments to rural communities &#8212; face &#8220;particularly constrained&#8221; access to clinical care as well as to the military chaplains and family support networks that active-duty personnel can tap, the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current complement of mental health professionals is woefully inadequate&#8221; to prevent and treat members of the military and their families, the report said. But it called the process for recruiting additional trained personnel &#8212; both civilian and military &#8212; &#8220;time consuming and cumbersome,&#8221; stating for example that the number who could be recruited over the next six months would be &#8220;well below&#8221; the number required to meet the needs.</p>
<p>The shortage is deepening as active-duty mental-health professionals, also stressed by repeated deployments and other frustrations, are leaving the military in growing numbers, the report said. The Air Force has lost 20 percent of mental health workers from 2003 to 2007, while the Navy lost 15 percent between 2003 and 2006, and the Army lost 8 percent from 2003 to 2005.</p>
<p>Financial resources for mental health treatment in the military are also lacking, the report found. Congress provided a boost of $600 million for PTSD and traumatic brain injury in the 2007 supplemental war funding, but more will be needed, S. Ward Casscells, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said at the news conference.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a recurring theme on this blog and in public political discourse that Republicans/Conservatives are mean, greedy, don&#8217;t care about the poor etc., while Democrats/Liberals are caring and compassionate. Of the Liberals and Conservatives I know personally, I cannot distinguish any difference in levels of altruism.</p>
<p>James Q. Wilson writes <a href="http://hebookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6989">this forward</a> to the book &#8220;Who Really Cares: America&#8217;s Charity Divide &#8211; Who Gives, Who doesn&#8217;t, and Why it Matters&#8221; by Arthur C. Brooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>When President Bush coined the term &#8220;compassionate conservatism,&#8221; many conservatives were understandably miffed. It seemed to concede to liberals that traditional conservatives are indeed a greedy, selfish bunch &#8211; unlike liberals, with their &#8220;commitment&#8221; to the poor and disadvantaged. Now comes an amazing new book that buries that old canard forever. In Who Really Cares: America&#8217;s Charity Divide &#8211; Who Gives, Who Doesn&#8217;t, and Why It Matters, Arthur C. Brooks uses hard data to prove that, when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives &#8211; especially religious conservatives &#8211; are far more generous than liberals, who seem to believe that &#8220;compassion&#8221; begins and ends with voting for government handouts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among his findings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservative households in America donate 30% more money to charity each year than liberal households, even in spite of lower average incomes</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives are also more generous in other ways, such as blood donations, and volunteer work. In fact, if liberals gave blood like conservatives do, the blood supply in the U.S. would jump by about 45% </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>People who mistrust big government give more than those who rely on the government to take care of the poor. This includes giving and volunteering even to traditionally &#8220;progressive causes&#8221; such as the arts and the environment <br />Conservative &#8220;red&#8221; states give away far more of their incomes than liberal &#8220;blue&#8221; states do </p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Sowell <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/11/who_really_cares.html">reviews the book</a> here:</p>
<blockquote><p>While both sides argue that their opponents are mistaken, those on the left have declared their opponents to be not merely in error but morally flawed as well&#8230; (w)hat is remarkable is how long it took for anyone to put that belief to the test &#8212; and how completely it failed that test</p></blockquote>
<p>I never understood how the Left and those in government (including the Right) feels it it is morally superior because it gives away other people&#8217;s money. &#8220;POSSIBLY THE EASIEST act for any human being is to spend money which does not belong to him,&#8221; wrote Robert L. Smitley in his 1933 classic, Popular Financial Delusions.</p>

<p>cactus here. A few comments of my own.</p>
<p>1. Considering I&#8217;ve spent the past couple of months putting up data showing that Republican Presidents do not perform better (and usually perform worse) than Democratic Presidents on things that Republicans like to campaign on (real economic growth, fiscal responsibility, abortions, marriages, etc.) turnabout is certainly fair play<br />2. I don&#8217;t have enough information to comment on most of the assertions made above. But I do question (and have had a post on this) the one about charitable giving. Here&#8217;s my quick summary (so I don&#8217;t overwhelm sammy&#8217;s post)&#8230; A very significant part of conservative charity is to the local church or house of worship. But in many instances, the local church is also a center of activity. Kids play basketball there after school or go to camp, the wife attends a book club, and the husband attends bible study. And that&#8217;s not even counting Sunday Services. In other words&#8230; in addition to the religious activities, its the equivalent of a gym membership plus entertainment. Non-church goers also engage in these activities &#8211; but membership in the local gym, sending the kids to a secular summer camp, attending adult education classes, and the like, is not considered charity (and cannot be written off on one&#8217;s taxes).</p>

<p>Mark Thoma had a link to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061502602.html?nav=rss_business">June 16 Washington Post article.</a> The article, a long one describes new contractor provided security in Iraq.</p>
<p>However, I did not find a discussion of the possibly applicable Anti Pinkerton Law.</p>
<p>The law, 5 USC 3108, states: </p>
<blockquote><p>An individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization, may not be employed by the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue is, is Blackwater like Pinkerton?</p>
<p>In the context of Iraq quite possibly. The act was made to prevent the US government from hiring Pinkerton paramilitaries and riot police from breaking up labor organization.</p>
<p>Now Iraqi insurgents do not have the honored tradition of US labor, but the law is the law and not conditioned on laborists verus Islamicists.</p>
<p>As a side light are convoy security and bodyguarding US protected officials commercial activities?</p>
<p>If so why not call in the Prince of Hesse?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OGRmOTJjOTk2NmYwZDAwYWUzM2MxNDY3ZjYwNmZmM2I=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> loves to dress up bogus arguments in some fancy ways.  He begins with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats in Congress and on the presidential trail are intensifying their high-tax war against prosperity and the so-called rich. Their latest salvo includes more tax penalties on successful investors and entrepreneurs, such as a proposed 4.3 percent surtax on high-income earners and a tax assault on the private-equity buyout industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>His opposition to this surtax is a plea not to return to the fiscally responsible period known as the 1990’s.  Kudlow is arguing like Rudy G. that a return to the 1990’s wouldn’t be prudent.  After all, they would rather pretend that growth rate in the 1990’s were dismal while growth under President Bush has been fantastic.  Never mind that the facts say the reverse was true.  </p>
<p>But here’s the fancy part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Up to now, Blackstone’s authoring statement had envisioned some kind of two-tiered tax plan, where ordinary corporate compensation would be taxed at the 35 percent corporate rate while high-risk investment-fund profits would be taxed at the 15 percent cap-gains rate. And now, senators Max Baucus (D., Mon.) and Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) want Blackstone to pay the much higher corporate tax on all its income. Normal salaries and income from straight-out financial services arguably should be taxed at the corporate rate. But the investment partnerships inside Blackstone constitute risk-taking. For example, if the risks don’t pay off with profits, there is no income to be taxed. So, should the Baucus-Grassley plan set up a new multiple tax on capital, it would have negative consequences on economic growth while diminishing the economic clout for risk-taking.  And this is just the start. The next step will be to raise the overall tax on private buyout partnerships, even though there’s no intent to go public. Former Clinton Treasury secretary Robert Rubin suggests more than doubling capital-gains taxes on these partnerships, telling a Washington conference that the lower rate on capital gains hasn’t contributed one iota to the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow wants his readers to believe that increasing the tax rate on capital gains would treat this form of income different from other forms of income.  But wait a second – if we double the current tax rate on capital gains, which is now only 15%, then the current disparity in tax rates would be reduced.  Kudlow goes onto to hammer the Democratic Presidential candidates on their tax hike agenda as if we were currently running Federal surpluses.  Never mind that the facts say we are running deficits.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003119.html">Max Sawicky</a> does not comment on Kudlow, he has links to a lot of the other discussions of this issue.  Another tip of my hat to Max as he continues to stay far ahead of this Left Coast Bear on D.C. tax controversies!</p>

<blockquote><p>Congress should not touch Old Age and Survivors Insurance (O.A.S.I.), &#8221;Social Security&#8221; in common parlance, this year. Leaving it alone is not just interest-group politics. It is good public policy. The Greenspan-O&#8217;Neill-Reagan compromise of 1983, bipartisan statesmanship at its best, adjusted both benefits and taxes, and assured the solvency of the O.A.S.I. trust fund well into the next century. According to official median projections, surpluses of O.A.S.I. tax receipts over benefits will be helping to balance the unified budget until 2020 … Now the Administration and the Senate want to make further permanent cuts in real benefits by tampering with the COLA again. Would they dare to propose the same cuts in dollars? Even if inflation were zero? … Proposed cuts in O.A.S.I. are neither necessary nor sufficient to improve the Federal fiscal outlook. General tax increases are the answer, as any arithmetician outside the White House knows. Tom Wicker (&#8221;A Deliberate Deficit,&#8221; column, July 19) has discovered what was perfectly clear in 1981, that the Reagan strategy was to create deficits in order to bludgeon Congress into axing Federal social spending, including &#8221;entitlements.&#8221; And now perhaps you will urge Congress to face squarely the true fiscal problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this op-ed was published on July 20, 1985 – it still rings true today.  Remember this the next time a GOP leader promises to pay for their tax “cuts” with “entitlement reform”.</p>

                                <p>I decided to head out to the gym this morning and while warming up I seemed to have seen Russert interviewing two writers for the National Review.  <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/06/17/meet-the-compromised">Christy Hardin Smith</a> confirms that I wasn’t losing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>What pissed me off this morning is this:  O’Beirne and York are clearly partisan writers, both working for the conservative National Review.  I’ve met Byron a few times and I think it is safe to say that he considers himself not only conservative, but also that he has vested a lot of interest in pushing the Libby end of the case whenever possible in media appearances and in his columns.  I don’t know O’Beirne, but the words “partisan hackery, whatever the cost to the facts” come to mind every time she is mentioned, for good reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I decided to check out the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19229645">MTP transcript</a> to see what kind of garbage was tolerated by Timmeh on the latest embarrassment to what used to be a fine Sunday talk show (well, it was good before Russert took over).  </p>
<p>For the Libby Lobby, O’Beirne started the spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS. O’BEIRNE: It certainly would help with his conservative supporters who had, who had long objected to what they see as politicized prosecution and I think they would give President Bush credit for being a stand-up guy who stood by a loyal White House staffer.</p></blockquote>
<p>They see as politicized prosecution?  Who is they, Kate?  Oh yea, your dishonest colleagues at the National Review.  Poor Byron York had to wait his turn as Russert turned to E.J. Dionne for a rare bit of honest discourse from Meet the Press.  All that was left for York to whine about is that the Judge decided to put Libby in jail well in advance of the November 2008 election, which gives Bush a tough choice between what Dionne has called:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Republican presidential candidates have two time frames to think about: their need to win conservative support in the nomination battle now and the general election imperative to break with what is looking like a discredited presidency. Taking a stand on a pardon [for]” Scooter “[Libby] forces an awkward and immediate choice between those objectives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I do feel bad for the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/bill-moyers-on-libby-lobby.html">Libby Lobby</a> – not!</p>

                                <p>A great line at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/06/when_chemistry_is_outlawed_onl.php">Pharyngula</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In the name of child safety, in order to inhibit drug peddlers, because we don&#8217;t want to make things easy for terrorists, we have put up bureaucratic barriers to the purchase of laboratory glassware — while encouraging unimpaired, unchecked access to guns.</p>
<p>Is this a screwed-up country, or what?</p></blockquote>
<p>The post is well worth a read.</p>
<p>Now, I hasten to add, I&#8217;m not in favor of banning guns.   (I do think there should be limits on what people should be allowed to own.  As I&#8217;ve stated before, I don&#8217;t want my neighbor owning a surface to air missile or belt-fed machine gun, and I don&#8217;t think felons should be allowed to own guns at all.)  But I&#8217;d prefer to ban guns than chemistry sets.</p>
