                                <p>This post looks at the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/hstpov2.html"> percentage of people living below the poverty level</a> over time. Here’s a graph of what it looks like, for as far back as the Census keeps data.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECQZumksI/AAAAAAAAAVA/zvAk6tg7nM8/s1600-h/poverty,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECQZumksI/AAAAAAAAAVA/zvAk6tg7nM8/s320/poverty,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From the graph its pretty clear… if there were two periods in which poverty declined, it was during the JFK/LBJ administrations, and during the Clinton administration. It seems to have meandered during the Nixon/Ford years, risen and the fallen (to end more or less unchanged) over the Reagan years, and risen during the Carter and two Bush administrations. (Editorial comment… There I go again with my Bush derangement syndrome… noticing that the Bush League Boys just didn’t perform. And the fact that I point out that Carter didn’t go anywhere either… its still BDS, because putting GW in there with history’s greatest monster is patently unfair.) </p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECK5umkrI/AAAAAAAAAU4/al3ukAJaTao/s1600-h/poverty,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECK5umkrI/AAAAAAAAAU4/al3ukAJaTao/s320/poverty,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And what drives poverty? Some quick and dirty correlations between the percentage change in the poverty rate and two series: the percentage change in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f04.html">Gini ratio</a> and <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">real median income</a>. (Note&#8230; Gini ratio is for families, real median income and poverty is for individuals&#8230; I simply can&#8217;t find the Gini ratio for individuals. Sorry.)</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqfcEEPDHdI/AAAAAAAAAeY/j5sYJBuA3L8/s1600-h/poverty,+redone.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqfcEEPDHdI/AAAAAAAAAeY/j5sYJBuA3L8/s320/poverty,+redone.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Update!!!!  The original Table 2 was incorrect.  Verbage rewritten &#8211; may affect some of the comments people left.  Apologies!!!<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>So what do we learn… there does seem to be a positive correlation between the gini ratio and poverty… higher poverty rates are associated with more inequality.  Note&#8230; leaving out the jump in the Gini in 1993 (see yesterday&#8217;s post)&#8230; the correlation between poverty and Gini goes up to .41.  </p>
<p>But the relationship between real median income and the poverty rate is stronger. Much stronger. Faster increases in real median income (repeat, median) are associated with decreases in the poverty rate. And faster increases in real median income in any given year are even more strongly correlated with real median income in later years.</p>
<p>Nothing in this post seems like a surprise to me.</p>
<p>Coming soon…. Justice!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  Figures in Table 2 were wrong when this post was first posted.  Thanks to Sebastian Holsclaw for pointing out a discrepancy and making me check the work again.</p>
<p>Wrong the second time too!!!! Apologies!!!</p>

<p>What does supporting the troops mean to you? If you ignore looking at these things, can you claim you are in the support category?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19187272">&#8220;Lead researcher Mark Kaplan of Portland State University in Oregon&#8221;</a> reports that</p>
<blockquote><p>male U.S. veterans are twice as likely to die by suicide than people with no military service, and are more likely to kill themselves with a gun than others who commit suicide….</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The study tracked 320,890 U.S. men, about a third of whom served in the U.S. military between 1917 and 1994. The rest had no military background.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Of the veterans, about 29 percent served in the Vietnam War, 28 percent in World War Two, 16 percent in the Korean War and the rest in other conflicts up through the 1991 Gulf War.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Those who committed suicide were more likely to have been white, better educated and older than the other men, the researchers found. The most acute risk was among veterans with some sort of a health problem that made them unable to participate fully in home, work or leisure activities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The researchers said unlike some previous studies on suicides among U.S. military veterans, theirs did not focus on Vietnam War-era veterans or veterans who get health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs system. They said three-quarters of veterans do not receive health care through VA facilities.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18488585/">Both the VA and the Pentagon in recent weeks have acknowledged</a> a need to improve “mental health treatment”. Jan Kemp, a VA associate director for education who works on mental health, has estimated there are up to 1,000 suicides a year among veterans within the VA system, and as many as 5,000 a year among all living veterans.</p>
<p>A recent investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that just 22 percent of U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who showed signs of PTSD were being referred by Pentagon health care providers for mental health evaluation, citing inconsistent and subjective standards in determining when treatment was needed.</p>
<p>Penny Coleman is the widow of a Vietnam Veteran who took his own life after coming home. Her latest book, Flashback: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Suicide and the Lessons of War, was released on Memorial Day, 2006. In a moving and compassionate way she outlines how ignoring this cost as an externality reverberates for years. She includes in her book how new discussions of human costs of war re-trigger old wounds and, in my mind, might have something to do with the irritability that readers mention about people they know.</p>
<p>And off topic but another problem faces soldiers. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18506417/page/2/">Military and family law experts don’t know how big the problem is</a>, but 5.4 percent of active duty members — more than 74,000 — are “single parents”, the Department of Defense reports. More than 68,000 Guard and reserve members are also single parents. Divorce among service personnel is rising.</p>
<p>Custody battles for male or female soldiers is a problem. Hence we have not looked at what conflicts might exist between reasonable laws of family, children, and supporting troops. Family court versus federal law. Why not?..it is a well known problem, and tangled.</p>
<p>To summarize posts to date:</p>
<p>The military admits to recognizing a real problem that warrants funding in addition to regular care.</p>
<p>To admit to symptoms means loss of career advancement for many. The actual hostility (soldier to soldier and superiors) to admitting symptoms is quite robust, but to date I have only anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>To seek help is to run into major barriers in VA, Tricare, and private insurers, depending on how you access your insurance. This includes your family as well.</p>
<p>The costs in the short run, much less long run remains as an externality to the cost of war. On the other hand, as more is known, it is harder to ignore.</p>
<p>The system to date appears to prevent best practice and good research from taking the lead as the metric seems to be geared to demand reduction rather than treatment efficacy in this realm of the cognitive sciences. Both public and private funding sources appear to use this metric.</p>
<p>Research is headed in the direction that PTSD is brain based and body based, and has been around awhile, and could help most soldiers and ex-soldiers and families. It is clearly diagnosable and treatments are successful.</p>

                                <p>Delphi and the United Auto Workers have reached a tentative agreement to buy-out or buy-down much of Delphi’s blue collar workforce and allow Delphi to come out of bankruptcy. (for details see www.freep.com)</p>
<p>There are a couple of subplots here:</p>
<p>1. General Motors is on the hook for much of the cost – Delphi was a spinoff of GM and GM retained many commitments. GM did not want Delphi to go Chapter 7.<br />2. The UAW had leverage this year, because a strike would have paralyzed GM. UAW leverage would have disintegrated in the future as GM moved to alternate suppliers.</p>
<p>Thus GM had a double interest in finding an amicable solution to this problem.</p>
<p>This is a costly victory for the UAW. At least 80% of all Delphi bluecollar jobs have or will be offshored soon, and eventually almost 100% of the blue collar jobs will be offshored. The UAW bought transition time and transition money, but not much else.</p>
<p>Former shareholders got zip as the company melted down in bad management and accounting fraud. The bankruptcy turnaround team of managers will get very rich.</p>
<p>This settlement will have an impact on this year’s Big 3 negotiations, although the dynamics are much different there, none of the companies would want a strike but all must get major cost concessions.</p>
<p>Long term, this probably spells the end of most auto parts manufacturing in the US, as other companies offshore to compete with Delphi and other offshoring leaders.</p>
<p>This could mean the loss of another 500,000 – 1,000,000 manufacturing jobs in the next decade (the tire business is also going overseas, but recent quality problems in China may slow this), with no replacements on the horizon.</p>
<p>To some economists, this job loss is a miracle of creative destruction and a major improvement in the economy. Others won’t be so happy. Based on recent experience, most of the former auto parts workers will never recover economically.</p>
<p>Should the government and  public policy intellectuals care? Should anyone care. Is this just the march of progress? Is this the fruits of erroneous economic models?</p>
<p>Write away.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on the Gini ratio and how it changes over time and across presidencies.  I had an earlier aborted look at the Gini ratio, but I’m trying again here.  </p>
<p>Let me start by simply copying some verbage from that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/not-really-post-lookin-at-income.html">earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This post is going to look like a post on income inequality by presidential administration. It even has a nice picture showing data going back to 1953. I&#8217;ll start by describing what I did, and then explain why its not a post on income inequality. </p>
<p>I was hoping data on the distribution of income per person. The IRS has data on idnvidual income, but it has several problems, not the least of which it doesn&#8217;t go back before 1987. (That&#8217;s OK, but not if other data is available.) The Census unfortunately only computes median and mean income for individuals. If you want to know how the income was distributed (e.g., bottom 20% get X, top 20% get Y, etc.) you have to make do with data on families or households. </p>
<p>So I decided OK, let&#8217;s go with families. See what it looks like. Well&#8230; the Census also goes ahead and computes the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f04.html">Gini ratio</a> for families in time series form. Basically&#8230; the closer to 0, the more equality, the closer to 1, the more inequality. (More information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">on Gini</a> here.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xopumkpI/AAAAAAAAAUo/bJJUbWgxaPM/s1600-h/Gini,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xopumkpI/AAAAAAAAAUo/bJJUbWgxaPM/s320/Gini,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, last time I got to this point, I noted the big structural break at the start of the Clinton admin and threw up my hands.  This time, I decided… heck, let’s deal with it.  If you look at the graph, there are several other points at which it really seems like something changed in the data.  I went back and checked each of these, and read the footnotes on the table…  I noted that on three occasions, there was what appeared to be a discontinuity in the graph that occurred on a year in which the Census made a big change in how it computed the data…</p>
<p>a.  In 1961, they used a new procedure to impute missing data<br />b.  In 1967, they came up with a new processing system<br />c.  In 1993, they started using a computer-assisted interview process</p>
<p>I assume the primary effect of these changes was to produce a one time jump in the series.  Therefore, to summarize results by President, for JFK/LBJ I am going to look only at the period from 1961 to 1966, and for Clinton, instead of looking at the change from 1992 to 2000, I will look at the change from 1993 to 2000.  (Note… the full term results appear at the bottom of the table regardless.  Note also that this is the same approach I used to deal with a discontinuity at the start of the Reagan administration on the post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-nuclear-family-or.html">children living in 2 parent households</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xjZumkoI/AAAAAAAAAUg/jnC4QQ8gFZQ/s1600-h/Gini,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xjZumkoI/AAAAAAAAAUg/jnC4QQ8gFZQ/s320/Gini,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what does the summary tell us?  The biggest movements toward equality occurred during the LBJ/JFK, Ike, and Clinton administrations.  GHW and Reagan bring up the rear.  GW and Nixon/Ford do better than Carter.  I don’t think any part of these results are surprising.</p>
<p>Now, with the exception of Ike, I don’t think any Republicans ever talked about equality of opportunity or making sure everyone got a fair shake.  So should this matter to Republicans?  And where does greater equality or inequality come from?  Was JFK right?  Does a rising tide (generally) lift all boats?  Granted, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">JFK/LBJ and Clinton had the fastest growing economies</a> in our sample, but Reagan came in third… Ike was second last and GHW last.  So let’s see what the data says about the relationship between changes in <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">real person median income</a> and changes in the Gini ratio…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xdpumknI/AAAAAAAAAUY/EQwjIvijEO4/s1600-h/Gini,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rn-xdpumknI/AAAAAAAAAUY/EQwjIvijEO4/s320/Gini,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(I probably should have used family median income for consistency, but I had personal data lying around.)  There’s a very small negative correlation between changes in the Gini ratio and changes in the median real income.  I doubt it would be significant if I were to run a rigorous test.  Similarly, changes in real income don’t seem to be associated with changes in income inequality.  But…  changes in the previous year’s median income have a –0.26 correlation with this year’s Gini ratio.  This may also not be significant…  but it is at least suggestive that the faster real median income rises, the greater the tendency toward equality in the distribution of income.  Not a huge effect, but it may well be there.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/arrest-sparks-legal-tussle/2007/06/24/1182623714851.html">SMH is reporting</a> that a US Navy sailor has been arrested by Australian officials for &#8220;grooming&#8221; a teenage Australian girl online. He was arrested after his ship docked in Rockhampton.</p>
<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2007/06/australian-hacker-jailed-in-us.html">As I pointed out the other day</a>, there is an increasing US-centric attitude to our legal system. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the US Navy is now demanding the sailor&#8217;s release into their own custody to deal with him as they choose.</p>
<p>I find this intolerable.</p>
<p>First of all, an Australian citizen commits a crime over the internet and is arrested and sent to the US for trial, even though he didn&#8217;t set foot in America. On the other hand, a US citizen commits a crime over the internet and is arrested as soon as enters Australia &#8211; and the US argues that he should be on trial in the US.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then he goes on to whine about how its unfair. I know this bothers the South Americans also, as now and then examples come up in the South American press. Buncha damn foreigners. They should be pleased and proud to be treated as vassals.</p>
<p>Two non-snarky comments now:<br />1.  I can see the point of this when dealing with a country where the legal system is somewhat shaky, say in some of the countries that are &#8220;friendly&#8221; to us like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.  <br />2.  Why One Salient Oversight picked a fictional country for his post is beyond me. Next we&#8217;ll be hearing about how things are going in Fantasyland.</p>

<blockquote><p>O&#8217;Reilly contended that many newspapers are losing circulation because they&#8217;ve allowed the &#8220;liberal&#8221; ideology of their editorial pages to &#8220;bleed into news coverage&#8221; &#8211; despite, he said, there being a greater number of &#8220;traditional conservatives&#8221; than liberals in the American population.</p></blockquote>
<p>I kid you not.  <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014803.php">Steve Benen</a> replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, if there’s one thing O’Reilly and his network understand, it’s the importance of keeping a clear distinction between news reporting and opinion journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Bill-O did not exist, we would have to invent him!  After all, what would <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677">Keith Olbermann</a> have to mock in a world without Bill O’Reilly?</p>

                                <p>Credit goes to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011548.php">Kevin Drum</a> for keeping track of the reactions from the <a href="http://levin.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTgzYjc2YjMyZGQ5NmEyOWFmZTc3MjQ3NjM1NGE1ZTE=">National Review</a> and the Weekly Standard’s <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/24/williams-kristol-cheney">Bill Kristol</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Levin doesn&#8217;t quite admit that Cheney&#8217;s theory is absurd, but he does sensibly suggest that it&#8217;s not exactly a winning argument. Meanwhile, the Weekly Standard&#8217;s Bill Kristol, after offering a desultory defense of Cheney on the grounds that oversight is &#8220;a pain in the neck,&#8221; also decided that discretion was the better part of valor … When you don&#8217;t even have Mark Levin and Bill Kristol on your side, it&#8217;s time to give it up. Maybe noted constitutional scholar Ann Coulter will find a way to defend Cheney, but it looks like that&#8217;s about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Levin and Kristol aren’t exactly condemning Cheney, it seems <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/006543.php">Glenn Reynolds</a> is not holding back:</p>
<blockquote><p>DICK CHENEY AS A LEGISLATIVE OFFICIAL: Ed Morrissey is not impressed with this gem of a legal argument. He&#8217;s right not to be, and he&#8217;s right that this is a political and legal embarrassment for the Administration, but it&#8217;s not because of the constitutional language he quotes &#8230; Whatever executive power a VP exercises is exercised because it&#8217;s delegated by the President, not because the VP has it already. So to the extent the President delegates actual power (as opposed to just taking recommendations for action) the VP is exercising executive authority delegated by the President, but unlike everyone else who does so he/she isn&#8217;t subject to removal from office by the President (though the President could always withdraw the delegation, of course). However &#8211; and here&#8217;s where the claim that Cheney is really a legislative official creates problems for the White House &#8211; it seems pretty clear that the President isn&#8217;t allowed to delegate executive power to a legislative official, as that would be a separation of powers violation. So to the extent that this is what&#8217;s going on, the &#8220;Cheney is a legislative official&#8221; argument is one that opens a big can of worms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Glenn refers to <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010325.php">Ed Morrissey</a> who really steps up to the plate:</p>
<blockquote><p>This dispute has two aspects to it, one political and one legal, and neither benefit the White House, at least not the way it is handling the issue. President Bush set rules governing the handling of classified material for the entire executive branch in a 2003 presidential order. If he wanted to exclude the White House and the Vice-President&#8217;s office in that order, he could have explicitly done so at the time. Without another order specifically doing that, the 2003 order should cover all executive-branch offices, including Bush and Cheney. The rule of law applies, not the rule of whim, and without another order outlining the specific responsibilities of the President and VP, that&#8217;s what Bush and Cheney&#8217;s demands appear to be.  While the legal case is tenuous at best &#8211; no one disputes that Bush could modify the order if necessary &#8211; the political case is solidly foolish. Why pick this fight? Is there a rational reason why the President and VP cannot comply with the same standards applied to the rest of the executive branch? If so, that argument has not found its way outside of the administration, leading people to wonder what the two have to hide.  The VP has strained credulity by arguing that he doesn&#8217;t belong to the executive branch at all, and that the order therefore doesn&#8217;t apply. Of course the VP is a member of the executive branch; he&#8217;s elected in tandem with the President through the Electoral College. He didn&#8217;t get elected President of the Senate, a title that springs from the authority of being VP, not the reverse. Arguing otherwise makes Cheney look ridiculous and desperate, begging the question of what has caused the desperation.  American culture and identity was formed on the basis that no man is above the law, not even Presidents and Vice-Presidents. If the executive order puts too much burden on the White House, then Bush should revoke or amend it, and explain why it&#8217;s necessary to do so. Stop trying to pretend that the VP is a member of the legislature and playing damaging games.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/chapter_1">Barton Gellman and Jo Becker</a> post the first part of a four-part series on the influence of Dick Cheney in this Administration:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cheney brought a four-page text, written in strict secrecy by his lawyer. He carried it back out with him after lunch. In less than an hour, the document traversed a West Wing circuit that gave its words the power of command. It changed hands four times, according to witnesses, with emphatic instructions to bypass staff review. When it returned to the Oval Office, in a blue portfolio embossed with the presidential seal, Bush pulled a felt-tip pen from his pocket and signed without sitting down. Almost no one else had seen the text. Cheney&#8217;s proposal had become a military order from the commander in chief. Foreign terrorism suspects held by the United States were stripped of access to any court &#8212; civilian or military, domestic or foreign. They could be confined indefinitely without charges and would be tried, if at all, in closed &#8220;military commissions.&#8221; &#8220;What the hell just happened?&#8221; Secretary of State Colin L. Powell demanded, a witness said, when CNN announced the order that evening, Nov. 13, 2001. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice, incensed, sent an aide to find out. Even witnesses to the Oval Office signing said they did not know the vice president had played any part.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/24/cheney-wp-profile">Faiz</a> and <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014792.php">Steve Benen</a> have more and <a href="http://www.warandpiece.com/blogdirs/006335.html">Laura Rozen</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world is full of examples of powerful people who think they are exempt from the laws because of some self justifying logic. But too bad for us tough guy Cheney with his impassioned commitment to torture and secret power couldn&#8217;t get bin Laden and failed to win the war in Iraq with his friend Rumsfeld. His sense of a higher purpose that justified circumventing the law and the deliberative process is totally divorced from the simple reality of the total ineptness of the administration&#8217;s service to America from Katrina to Iraq to its failure to get bin Laden and finish al Qaeda. We didn&#8217;t get a better policy because Cheney thought he knew better and was hostile to process, we got failed one after failed one after failed one. Even with all that secret extra-legal power he yielded and bestowed for all these years, he couldn&#8217;t show success on any front when it mattered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cheney isn’t part of the Executive Branch.  He IS the Executive Branch.  Or is it that he is above the Executive Branch?  As <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014787.php">Steve Benen</a> notes, Cheney has been claiming he’s not to be held to the same rules as members of the Executive Branch for a while. </p>
<p>One has to wonder – why didn’t Congress impeach Dick Cheney by now?  Maybe, it’s because they were told that Cheney is too powerful to be impeached.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/early_warning.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> reads the following from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg200405280814.asp">Jonah Goldberg</a> and has to react to what appears to be incredible stupidity:</p>
<blockquote><p>There were more than 35,000 pictures of FDR taken. Two show him in a wheelchair. Why? Because the press almost unanimously agreed that &#8211; despite the huge news value &#8211; depicting FDR as a cripple would be bad for the war effort. The few dissenting photographers from that consensus were routinely blocked or deliberately jostled by the senior photographers so as to shield FDR from embarrassment and the public from its &#8220;right to know.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt reminds Mr. Goldberg of the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, this is a subject I know virtually nothing about. I do, however, know that FDR became president in 1933 after winning the 1932 election. The war in Europe didn&#8217;t begin until 1939, and the United States didn&#8217;t enter the war until 1941. Under the circumstances, that &#8220;depicting FDR as a cripple would be bad for the war effort&#8221; can&#8217;t be the primary reason nobody ever did it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt at least admits that he does not know much about the press and FDR but Matt clearly knows more than Jonah “I’ll write on any topic of which I know shit” Goldberg (OK, that’ my quote but Goldberg is generally clueless about almost everything he opines on).  But I think Matt left Mr. Goldberg off easy when one consider the main theme of this incredibly pathetic NRO post:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the process of debating the merits of publishing, and now continually hyping, the Abu Ghraib photos, I keep hearing that it is contrary to the American journalistic tradition to let patriotism or concern about the negative effects of bad news interfere with coverage. I have no idea where this idea comes from … But my aim isn&#8217;t to score ideological points about liberal bias. This isn&#8217;t about attacking liberals. Most of the &#8220;giants&#8221; of journalism were, after all, liberals protecting liberal politicians and liberal objectives.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right boys and girls.  Having pictures of the President in a wheelchair is on par with those pictures of Americans abusing Iraqi prisoners.  I’m sorry – but this is truly a disgusting comparisons even for those wretched creatures over at the National Review.</p>
<p>[And yes, one of Matt&#8217;s readers reminded him that Goldberg&#8217;s stupid and disgusting piece was written over three years ago.]</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014785.php">Joshua Marshall</a> finds something more recent from <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg12jun12,0,4683079.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">Jonah Goldberg</a> to pick on:</p>
<blockquote><p>HERE&#8217;S A GOOD question for you: Why have public schools at all? … Consider Washington, home of the nation&#8217;s most devoted government-lovers and, ironically, the city with arguably the worst public schools in the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Josh simply demolishes Goldberg’s argument.  But I have another question.  I consider my hometown newspaper, the LA Times, to be quite good.  So why did it ask such a serial idiot as Jonah Goldberg to pen such stupid op-eds on a regular basis?</p>
