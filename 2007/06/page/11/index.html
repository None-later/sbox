                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI=">John Tamny</a> starts his attack with yet another episode of how stupid the writers at the National Review really are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton seeks to expand the earned-income tax credit (EITC). Though the credit was brought into the policy mix by no less of a free-marketeer than the late Milton Friedman, it should be remembered that income subsidies will only serve to expand the supply of lower-skilled workers. While an expanded EITC would add to worker pocketbooks with one hand, it would potentially reduce wages with the other as a rising supply of labor would chase low paying jobs and drive down incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s recast this in terms of the incidence of a subsidy.  It is true that employers will get a portion of this subsidy in the form of lower wages but Tamny is trying to say that more than 100% of the subsidy would accrue to employers.  He continues to confuse himself on other fronts:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the subject of outsourcing, Clinton contradicts herself in decrying the movement of jobs overseas. This outsourcing is, among other things, the result of rising wage pressures at home, such that companies seek lower-cost labor elsewhere. Were firms to underutilize the finite supply of stateside labor with low-value work, lower pay would be the result since investors would be unwilling to pay a high price for something that could be done more cheaply elsewhere. Clinton forgets that without capital, there are no wages, and no jobs. On the corporate-taxation front, Clinton contradicts her push for higher wages with her desire to make “corporations pay their fair share of taxes.” She forgets that without profit, there is no investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the first thing that a visitor from another planet had read on the U.S. economy was this passage, our visitor might have been led to believe that the U.S. under George W. Bush had undergone a rise in its national savings rate which drove up real wages.  But real wages have not been dramatically rising – which is not surprising as the fiscal irresponsibility of this Administration has reduced national savings.  If Senator Clinton wants to commit ourselves to the fiscal responsibility that we saw during her husband’s Administration, maybe we will see more savings and investment, which could restore real wage growth.  But the readers of the National Review are not allowed to think in terms of the Solow growth model.  Rather – they are asked to believe in the free lunch fantasies of Lawrence Kudlow and his ilk.</p>

                                <p>Its a beautiful day, but despite that, I have to work. I should be doing productive stuff right now, but by way of <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/betsynewmark/6139918204353265188/#372762">this comment</a> at Betsy&#8217;s Page, a right wing blog, I became aware of <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/06/with_the_american_presidential.cfm">this piece</a> at the Economists&#8217; Free Exchange. </p>
<p>It seems that my look at Dems versus Rep Presidents has come under attack. I was going to write up a well reasoned reply, but, to quote John Candy in Canadian Bacon: &#8220;There&#8217;s a time to think, and a time to act. And this, gentlemen, is no time to think.&#8221; </p>
<p>So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>
<blockquote>This sort of analysis is, of course, quite beloved of Democrats with a smattering of statistics; not so beloved of the Republicans who spit soda all over their new flatscreens when they see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny. I started looking at data in response to stuff I saw on the Cato Institute, put out by the Club for Growth, or in articles by Thomas Sowell. These always seemed to me to be very carefully constructed so as to show the desired outcomes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with most of these sorts of analyses are plentiful. They have too few sample points…</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is what degrees of freedom are for… Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the textbooks on my shelf, but the t distribution tables in the back of those textbooks have as few as 1 (one) degree of freedom. When the degrees of freedom are low, the t-statistics has to be really high in order in to reject H0. Or something like that – what do I know? I only have a smattering of statistics.</p>
<blockquote><p>and worse, they generally treat the points as if they were independent events, rather than (as they are) dependent on the points immediately preceding</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see. I did this several ways, with several data sets. Maybe you can argue that with quarterly data (in which case the few observation issue goes by the wayside, even for someone that is unacquainted with the t statistic). But I also did the study by administration (hence the argument about few points, I guess). If one wants to argue some sort of path dependence between Ike’s performance, JFK/LBJ’s, and Nixon, let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the first year of JFK/LBJ’s term was heavily dependent on Ike’s administration – after all, the budget was Ike’s. But a few years later? I’d be more inclined to accept an argument from someone on the right that the “Great Society” had no effect on the economy if I hadn’t heard so many times that this massive expansion of the role of government in the economy was bad for the economy. One can have one’s cake or one can eat it. </p>
<blockquote><p>you are more likely to get very rapid growth if you have had very poor growth somewhat recently</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes. But I also put up figures leaving out periods of recessions, and also leaving out recessions plus two years. I note… Republican administrations seem to have more recessions and to spend more time in recession (shouldn&#8217;t this phase Republicans?), so this in effect means cherry-picking Republican performance. Despite that, Republicans still didn’t do as well as Dems. </p>
<p>And does this also apply to other series that I looked at, like the growth rate in real health care costs or youth crime? Why?</p>
<p>Also&#8230; is this a comment on lags? I note that I had an entire post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/democrats-republicans-and-lags.html">on lags</a> and how they relate to this issue. For the lag argument to work, it has to vary in length. I&#8217;ve heard folks on the right attribute the growth rate in the Clinton administration to Reagan, but never the growth in the GHW administration that immediately follows Reagan&#8217;s. And I have yet to find a right winger willing to attribute Reagan&#8217;s growth to Nixon/Ford, or worse, Carter.</p>
<p>The next point in the piece was a graph… showing percent change real gdp per capita quarterly. The author decided it helped her back up her point of fast growth following slow growth… I have a bit of a headache right, so maybe I’m missing something here and I’m not seeing what she’s getting at. Whatever it is, it doesn’t apply to the administration as a whole analysis. And it’s also sure a lot of points…</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Ray Fair has argued that these variables are also likely to determine election results, this makes it a little tricky to attribute any sort of causation. The results are also pretty sensitive to choice of start year; for some reason, none of them ever starts with FDR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why not start with FDR? Regular readers know I consistently try to start with Ike’s election (assuming the data goes back to that point). Too far back, and the world changes too much. The Republican and Democratic personnae that we know today are not hugely different from the ones that existed immediately after WW2. I could likewise ask why, if the Republicans are the Party of Lincoln, they aren’t the most liberal party out there when it comes to, say, rights for Black people?</p>
<p>But OK. Fine. Let&#8217;s look at FDR because it seems that the author of this piece feels his inclusion will change things. I wandered over to Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">National Income and Product Accounts Table 7.1</a> and pulled data on real GDP per capita. In 1932, the last year before he took office, real GDP per capita was $5,056. In 1945, when he died, it was $12,766. This translates to a growth rate of 6.84% per year. (Note… this is how I’ve been doing the analysis so far… last year before taking office to last year in office.) If we sum the annual growth rates of every Republican President starting with Nixon and running through 2006, it comes to 6.46%. I’m not sure this is a comparison the author had in mind. </p>
<p>But I can hear the response now… it was the war. It was the war that saved FDR. The US entered the war on December 7, 1941. So let’s go with 1941. Real GDP per capita in 1941 was $9,079. A growth rate of… 6.03%. Maybe 1940 is better? 4.98% annual. </p>
<p>Anyway, I could go on, but this is really silly. Going back to FDR is not going to hurt my hypothesis. </p>
<blockquote><p>This analysis gets around some of this first problem by using quarters, rather than years or (stupider still, and most common&#8211;presidential terms), and testing various lags, but the dependency problems remain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Why is it stupider still? If Reagan’s performance was everything we hear, why shouldn’t I look at his annualized performance? Isn&#8217;t that a relevant metric? Or is opinion the only thing that matters?</p>
<p>And why did Reagan’s third best in sample performance follow Carter’s fourth best? I thought good performance followed bad ones. It certainly works when you look at each of the non-Reagan Republican administrations. </p>
<blockquote><p>no one ever really posits a good mechanism that would make it so.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then she mentioned a few mechanisms I suggested, including a few she said I dismiss out of hand are…</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic policies aren&#8217;t any better for the economy than Republicans, actually, but people think they are, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</p></blockquote>
<p>If this were true, wouldn’t it be a good reason to vote Democratic? What is leadership except making people believe enough that they act upon it? What Reagan sold was “morning in America” and by selling it, he made it true. On the other hand, GHW’s delivery of “a thousand points of light” or whatever never quite rang true.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a spurious correlation</p></blockquote>
<p>Well sure. But I looked at a bunch of series. These results don&#8217;t stand in isolation. And I ran the means test on a series that doesn’t include debt. Looking at Real GDP per capita less change in real debt per capita (after all – you can boost real GDP per capita simply by spending money, but eventually it has to be paid back so this is a more fair measure of performance), for example, the P-value of the the same test is 0.00764. Let me repeat&#8230; eight tenths of a percent.  The probability of a Type 1 error in the tests that I mentioned in the blog post is either 1% or 5% when you’re using quarterly or administration long data.  Sure, it may be spurious, but at this point I think those who feel it is have the onus on them.  </p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s some third factor that produces both economic growth, and Democratic administrations</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is such a thing… why does GW&#8217;s performance fall in with other Reps rather than Dems? He did lose the popular vote in 2000. If something delivers both economic growth and Democratic administrations, and the something delivered the votes for a Democratic administration, where is the growth? And what happened in 1984? A landslide for Reagan, but Democrat-quality growth. This hypothesis doesn’t fit known facts.</p>
<blockquote><p>people might vote Democratic when they&#8217;re not worried about the economy, and Republican when they want someone to fix it, which would mean that Republicans would end up with a disproportionate number of awful quarters. I have no particular evidence that this is true, mind you, and there may be some disconfirming data on the wind. But I can&#8217;t rule it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>1992… “It’s the economy, stupid.” 1976? In two of the elections in the sample that produced Democratic administrations, the economy was an issue, and not because things were going well. Reagan also was elected partly on the basis of the economy. Was GW? She may not be able to rule it out. I think the rest of us can.</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is this: which policies?</p>
<p>Which policies, as practiced by Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy, and Harry Truman, but not by the Georges Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower, are good for the American economy? Economic policy has changed so much over the last fifty years that Nixon and Eisenhower have, economically, far more in common with their Democratic predecessors and successors than they do with Reagan or the Bushes.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK. If we focus on the post-WW2 era, it would seem the policies to emulate are those of JFK/LBJ, wouldn’t it? Almost 3.5% annual growth in real GDP per capita! Clinton, the second best performer, would also do in a pinch. Or, if we go with the eras beginning with FDR, it would seem the policies to emulate are those of FDR. 6.84% growth in real GDP per capita? That’s more than 2.5 times Reagan’s growth rate. Give me some of that, please! And seconds too. But I’m not sure this is where the author of the piece really wants to take things – my guess is she’d prefer something akin to Reagan’s term.</p>
<p>And then the author bring sup the Superbowl effect… Well, a few problems. First, I&#8217;m pretty sure the probability produced by the Superbowl effect is not as high as in the tests I ran. Second, there is no mechanism for the Superbowl effect. But is someone that works for the Economist really trying to argue that the President of the United States has no effect on the growth rate of the US Economy?</p>

                                <p>So how did Chris and Ben Affleck get <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556">this one</a> right?</p>
<blockquote><p>AFFLECK:  Giuliani, without a doubt.  Giuliani is by far their toughest candidate.  Giuliani is—I thought he did great in the debate.  I think he has—because he—if he can get through the primaries with some of those liberal views, it‘s harder to pain him as an extremist socially.  I think he‘s well-spoken.  He‘s assertive.  I think he knows how to play to his strength, which is being the kind of—the daddy that protects you when times are hard.  Unfortunately, the way that he does that is by kind of engendering fear in the audience.  But it‘s an extremely effective political tactic, and he‘s very good at it.</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  I agree. And he never lets us forget 9/11 and never lets us forget the possibility of another terrorist attack, does he.  Ever.</p>
<p>AFFLECK:  No.  And I don‘t think it‘s—frankly, I object to it, but I think just from the macro point of view, it‘s excellent politics.  And if he‘s the only one I think that—from a totally amateur man on the road, what do I know, I‘m just a dumb actor point of view&#8230;</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  I know.</p>
<p>AFFLECK:  &#8230; I think he‘s the only one who‘s got a shot at it.</p>
<p>MATTHEWS:  And by the way, I disagree with you about you being an amateur.  But I‘ll tell you one thing.  I agree with what Fareed Zakaria wrote in “Newsweek” this week, which is terrorism isn‘t explosions and death, terrorism is when you change your society because of those explosions and you become fearful to the point where you shut out immigration, you shut out student exchanges, you shut people out of buildings, you begin to act in an almost fascist manner because you‘re afraid of what might happen to you.  That‘s when terrorism becomes real and frighteningly successful.  That‘s what I believe, and that‘s why I question the way Giuliani has raised this issue.  He raises it as a specter.  In a weird way, he helps the bad guys.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rudy is a lot like George W. Bush in his spreading fear to justify “daddy government”.  Neither one of them is a conservative in the sense of supporting a limited government.</p>

<blockquote><p>The NYT has a very nice feature in today&#8217;s paper, a calculator that allows you to see how wages have grown over the last four decades. You can make comparisons for a wide variety of demographic characteristics, occupations, and industries. You can even plus your own info in and see how you&#8217;re doing compared to your peers. This is nice,  it&#8217;s giving people real information. That&#8217;s what newspapers are supposed to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree but I have one nitpick with the title which talks about “wealth” whereas the calculator graphs real salaries.  Their instructions continue the error in terminology by calling this salary calculator a “wealth calculator”.  Could someone let the New York Times know that stocks and flows are different concepts.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/profit_theory_i.html">Mark Thoma</a> has an interesting post that links to other interesting posts on one aspect of the debate between the neoclassical v. heterodox economics crediting <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/07/profits-and-loss">Daniel Davies</a> for raising the question noted in my title:</p>
<blockquote><p>The anomaly I’m talking about is that neoclassical economics, in both macro and micro forms, nearly invariably works on the basis of models in which there are no profits.  Since in general, companies do earn profits, I think this is a pretty big problem. Let me add a couple of caveats. Neoclassical economics does allow for “normal profits”, meaning a sufficient surplus of income over expense to repay the cost of financial capital. But this isn’t really profit at all, and it doesn’t describe economic behaviour at all well &#8211; firms which are merely earning their cost of capital certainly don’t in general think that they’re doing as well as can be expected with no room for improvement.  Neoclassical economics also allows for monopoly profits to be earned in situations in which there are legal or practical barriers to entry into industries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/06/profits.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> brings up the national income accounts and the capital share:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of gross domestic income is wages, about 56%.   Proprietor&#8217;s income and corporate profits are together about 17% but most of proprietor&#8217;s income is really labor income and a good chunk of corporate profits is interest and a return to capital.  In a generous accounting true profits might be 5-10% of gross domestic income &#8211; not zero but not very large either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alex is referring to table 1.11 of the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA accounts</a>.  Table 1.12 is entitled National Income by Type of Income.  Adding proprietors&#8217; income to compensation of employees – these two items represent 72.3% of national income.  So if Alex is right about proprietors&#8217; income being labor income, the capital share is just over 25% of national income.  How much of this could be explained by the neoclassical model depends on what the model says about the capital to output ratio and the return to capital.  If we assume that the capital to output ratio is around 3 and the return to capital is around 8%, then the neoclassical model would predict a capital share of 24%.  So maybe there is a little bit of an anomaly to explain, but let’s not get too carried away.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Certain Senate Republicans seem to be annoyed when Senate Democrats want to offer <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=116&#038;sid=1160423">amendments</a> to the immigration reform bill:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senators had been debating a contentious immigration overhaul for hours when Obama &#8211; the Illinois Democrat running for president &#8211; introduced an amendment that would end a key provision after five years rather than 14.  His target was a proposed point system that would make it easier for would-be immigrants to obtain visas based on their education levels or work skills rather than on having close relatives already living in the United States. &#8220;We can&#8217;t weaken the essence of what America is by turning our backs on immigrants who want to reunite with their family members,&#8221; Obama said in his speech. The amendment infuriated Graham, a South Carolina Republican with close ties to another presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Pacing the Senate floor and waving Obama&#8217;s amendment, Graham loudly accused Obama of undermining a delicate agreement whose advocates have shown political courage.</p></blockquote>
<p>But when Harry Reid decided to move this bill towards a Senate vote, Mitch McConnell stuck a knife in the back of the majority leader as reported <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/07/congress.immigration.ap/index.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A broad immigration bill to legalize millions of people unlawfully in the United States failed a crucial test vote in the Senate Thursday, a stunning setback that could spell its defeat for the year.  The vote was 45-50 against limiting debate on the bill, 15 short of the 60 that the bill&#8217;s supporters needed to prevail. Most Republicans voted to block Democrats&#8217; efforts to bring the bill to a final vote … Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who had made no secret of his distaste for parts of the bill, said he would withdraw it but keep working toward eventual passage.  &#8220;I, even though disappointed, look forward to passing this bill,&#8221; Reid said. But he said he needs help from the White House. &#8220;This is the president&#8217;s bill,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;&#8230; We can&#8217;t do it alone over here. We need some help.&#8221; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urged Reid not to give up on the legislation, but allow debate on amendments to continue in order to resolve the objections of conservative senators. &#8220;This is a complicated bill, but the key to passage is not complicated,&#8221; McConnell said.  McConnell said all that&#8217;s needed is a &#8220;reasonable number of additional roll-call votes&#8221; on amendments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me get this straight.  When Senator Obama wants to offer an amendment to this bill – he gets attacked by Lindsey Graham.  But when Senator Reid wants to move this bill to a vote, the GOP leadership submarines the effort as they want more debate on new amendments.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011461.php">Kevin Drum</a> provides a nice summary of the politics in the Senate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at the numbers. This was a bipartisan bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy and John McCain and supported by George Bush. Democrats voted 37-11 in favor of moving forward to a final vote. Republicans voted 38-7 against it. In the end, the Democratic leadership delivered nearly 80% of its votes. Bush couldn&#8217;t even get 20% of his party to go along. All I can say is: if it was extremists that killed this bill, then 80% of the Republican Party is made up of extremists.</p></blockquote>
<p>I truly abhor for Mitch McConnell to the degree that I would never turn my back on here knowing he just loves to stab Democrats in the back.  The minority leader is not to be trusted.  But Senator McConnell usually goes along with whatever President Bush wants.  In his Saturday morning radio address, the President pleaded that this bill should go forward.  If he was serious about this please, he would have Senator McConnell work in good faith with Senator Reid.</p>

                                <p>On one level, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTJmNWMxZGMyNDI1Y2YzODE2ZTRiMjhiZTk2N2E0OGQ=">William Buckley</a> admits to the obvious:</p>
<blockquote><p>The evidence appears to have been overwhelming that he lied to the FBI, and that in so doing he hindered the execution of justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you begin to think that Mr. Buckley has decided to rise about the partisan liars known as the Corner Kids, read on:</p>
<blockquote><p>What he did was to involve himself in a security matter of no consequence. It was of no consequence at the time Libby figured in the proceedings because the nature of Joseph Wilson’s mission to Niger had already been revealed in the press, and his wife, Valerie Plame, was already moving out of the covert branch of the CIA &#8230; What he did was to involve himself in a security matter of no consequence. It was of no consequence at the time Libby figured in the proceedings because the nature of Joseph Wilson’s mission to Niger had already been revealed in the press, and his wife, Valerie Plame, was already moving out of the covert branch of the CIA &#8230; In the present case, Mrs. Wilson had already been assigned to non-covert work in the CIA &#8230; The reason to give thought to the triviality of Libby’s offense is precisely to unburden Bush of any sense of collaboration with true crime if he uses his pardoning power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Buckley is not so stupid to think doing non-convert work during one month necessarily means one will not be doing covert work during the next.  Despite all the lies from his National Review colleagues purporting Ms. Plame was no longer a covert agent, the public record now clearly shows she was.  Mr. Buckley cannot stand behind a premise that is clearly false.  So why does he think the outing of a CIA agent to be a trivial matter?  Or for that matter – obstruction of justice seems to also be a trivial matter to Mr. Buckley as well.  How can he even begin to make such a statement?  Oh yea – he writes for the National Review.  Never mind.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is going to look like a post on income inequality by presidential administration.  It even has a nice picture showing data going back to 1953.  I&#8217;ll start by describing what I did, and then explain why its not a post on income inequality.  </p>
<p>I was hoping data on the distribution of income per person.  The IRS has data on idnvidual income, but it has several problems, not the least of which it doesn&#8217;t go back before 1987.  (That&#8217;s OK, but not if other data is available.)  The Census unfortunately only computes median and mean income for individuals.  If you want to know how the income was distributed (e.g., bottom 20% get X, top 20% get Y, etc.) you have to make do with data on families or households.  </p>
<p>So I decided OK, let&#8217;s go with families.  See what it looks like.  Well&#8230; the Census also goes ahead and computes the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f04.html">Gini Ratio</a> for families in time series form.  Basically&#8230; the closer to 0, the more equality, the closer to 1, the more inequality.  (More information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">on Gini</a> here.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmrEbJumj9I/AAAAAAAAAPI/WSKlqW3WtdU/s1600-h/gini,+families.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmrEbJumj9I/AAAAAAAAAPI/WSKlqW3WtdU/s320/gini,+families.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For the most part, the data fits with my intuition.  But there&#8217;s a problem&#8230; a huge jump between the last year of GHW&#8217;s term and the start of Clinton&#8217;s.  The same huge jump seems to exist with other series (e.g., percentage of income going to the top 5% jumps a lot, and we see the same thing with household data).  </p>
<p>To me, that speaks for a break&#8230; a change in how the series was computed.  Am I wrong about this?  Did income distribution jump that much between GHW&#8217;s term and Clinton&#8217;s, or is something wrong with the data?</p>

<blockquote><p>People often suppose or imply that free-market economists constitute a significant portion of all economists. We surveyed American Economic Association members and asked their views on 18 specific forms of government activism. We find that about 8 percent of AEA members can be considered supporters of free-market principles, and that less than 3 percent may be called strong upporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>They go on to suggest reasons why Economists tend to have the reputation for being free market types, one of the big ones being that they are&#8230; relative to other social science practitioners.</p>

                                <p>As I have said many times, when it comes to off-shoring, the domino effect prevails. Once a developing country&#8217;s manufacturing costs start to rise, global corporations look to the next country in the list. Most of us are aware that whole chains of production&#8211;including R&#038;D&#8211;have been moving to China. Well, one of the next stops is Vietnam. Here, according to <a href="http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=14302">Alex Bryant</a> in <i>Industry Week</i>, are the advantages of the new Asian newcomer:
<ul>
<li>In comparison to many of its Asian neighbors, Vietnam has a relatively inexpensive labor rate. For factory operators, the average salary is $200.00/month while key managers and senior engineers are paid $1,500.00/month. Vietnam has a 48 hour work week and the government-mandated social programs are approximately 25% of the salary costs. In comparison, China has a 40 hour work week and social costs are 50-60% of the operator&#8217;s salary.</p>
</li>
<li>The Vietnamese workforce is well-educated and hungry. The average age of an operator is 24 and a growing percentage of the workforce has a comfort zone with English as a second language due in large part to the availability of English language centers.
</li>
<li>The government has implemented an aggressive program of corporate income tax incentives. This program involves up to 4 years of tax holiday following (and including) the first year of &#8216;carried forward&#8217; profitability. Thereafter, the tax rate is 1/2 of the nominal tax rate for a period of up to 7 years, with a total application period of up to 15 years. The nominal tax rate can be 10%, 15%, or 20% &#8212; depending on the industry sector, investment classification and location. The standard tax rate is 28%.
</li>
<li>There are also duty free programs for the importation of capital goods (new and refurbished).
</li>
<li>While behind China, the Vietnamese government is committed to developing infrastructural balance, especially electricity and water supply, seaport services and telecom. Bilateral lenders and grants continue to be plentiful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economists would do well to read industry magazines and those directly involved in globalization. They know how globalization works.</p>
<p>In conjunction with this piece of good news for the likes of Intel&#8211;which is investing one billion dollars in Ho Ching Ming City (an investment Intel&#8217;s suppliers will surely supplement as they move to Vietnam as well)&#8211;, economists are now finally arguing over the effect of all this offshoring on U.S. GDP. (Read <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_25/b4039001.htm">Business Week</a>.) Money is certainly pouring into the U.S. in the form of profits and upper management salaries. For the rest of us who have not been invited to the party, keep a tight grip on whatever benefits you presently have. We have a bifurcated economy.</p>
<p>Eventually, this game will end&#8230;and not happily. If we follow its logic, country after country will be squeezed. As soon as it the costs in one country start to rise, as soon as wages, for example go up, capital will move on to the next country. Following the logic further, each time a developing country tries to create a consuming, widespread, middle class, it and the U.S. will experience inflationary pressures as companies try to maintain profits or scramble to find more fertile cheap labor and other benefits.</p>
<p>Countries do not suddenly develop middle classes. Imagine that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_angrybear_archive.html">poor Ipod</a> worker in China. Suppose his salary doubles from sixty cents an hour to $1.20/hour. That is inflationary. But is he now ready to step forward as a consumer? Not really. We have doubled the wage cost of the very goods we expect him to buy, but doubling his salary does not remotely begin to put him in middle class range. Globalization has been profoundly deflationary, both in services and goods, offsetting the rise in the price of energy. Many measure it as &#8220;efficiency.&#8221; This &#8220;efficiency&#8221; is an illusion and will come at a future cost. Cheap labor is efficient when it remains cheap&#8211;or gets cheaper.</p>
<p>And what will the Fed do as inflationary pressures rise, as the cost of goods rise, or as the dollar slumps against other countries, or as the price of energy increases? Raise rates?</p>
<p>The transition to a consuming society, assuming we get that far, will be very, very bumpy. The discrepancies between the West and developing countries are simply too vast. China&#8217;s real consumption so far has been in amazing infrastructure development, not in consumer goods. When the WTO ignored labor, it created a mechanism that cannot succeed. The models are too simplistic. Free trade between impoverished and wealthy nations cannot work as designed. We have created a complex mosaic of falling dominoes. Eventually, everyone will be flattened.</p>
