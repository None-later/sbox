                                <p><a href="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/news/pr/286/index.php">Rudy</a> pledges the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. I will keep America on offense in the Terrorists’ War on Us.<br />2. I will end illegal immigration, secure our borders, and identify every non-citizen in our nation.<br />3. I will restore fiscal discipline and cut wasteful Washington spending.<br />4. I will cut taxes and reform the tax code.<br />5. I will impose accountability on Washington.<br />6. I will lead America towards energy independence.<br />7. I will give Americans more control over, and access to, healthcare with affordable and portable free-market solutions.<br />8. I will increase adoptions, decrease abortions, and protect the quality of life for our children.<br />9. I will reform the legal system and appoint strict constructionist judges.<br />10. I will ensure that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters.<br />11. I will provide access to a quality education to every child in America by giving real school choice to parents.<br />12. I will expand America’s involvement in the global economy and strengthen our reputation around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2007/06/rudy_giulianis_12_commitments_">James Joyner</a> has his doubts over each one – especially #12:</p>
<blockquote><p>How could we be more involved in the global economy? And how are you going to do this while shutting down our borders, chasing illegal aliens, and stopping the import of energy from abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain, let’s go back to #2:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, you won’t. And, frankly, I wouldn’t want to give you (or anyone else) enough power to “identify every non-citizen in our nation.” There are over 300 million people living here, stretched across a continental landmass. How on earth would you do that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent!  I heard Rudy talking about #1 where he claimed we Democrats were for reducing our commitment to fighting the war on terrorism.  Way to go Rudy – just flat out lie to the American people!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I want to be fair and balanced so I should say something nice about Mitt Romney as well.  <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/12/quote_of_the_day">Eric Kleefeld</a> notes Barney Franks has done this for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real Romney is clearly an extraordinarily ambitious man with no perceivable political principle whatsover. He is the most intellectually dishonest human being in the history of politics.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/12/rudy_raising_money_off_lists_of_jewish_newspaper_readers">Greg Sargent</a> has some details on Rudy’s dishonest Dem bashing.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: AB reader Divorced one like Bush reminds us of the <a href="http://www.house.gov/house/Contract/CONTRACT.html">Contract On America</a>.  Compare Rudy’s commitments #3 and #4 to “the fiscal responsibility act”.  When a Republican says he can balance the budget and cut taxes simply by reducing “waste Washington spending”, that Republican has told a big flat lie.  Way to go Rudy!</p>

                                <p>CoRev posted <a href="http://pcrevolt.blogspot.com/2007/06/msm-at-its-best.html">this</a> at his blog and asked if it could be posted here too.  I&#8217;ll do it, but only because I have some comments at the end.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In the military there are shaped charges to maximize damage.  In the <br />Main Stream Media there are shaped articles to create the same results.  <br />Here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>Army Sees First Big Slip In Recruiting in <br />2 Years</p></blockquote>
<p> Big Slip?</p>
<p>Inside the article we find this:<br />
<blockquote>The Army fell short of its <br />recruiting goal for May, its first significant slip in two<br />years.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not only the first ?significant? slip in two years <br />we find that the other services met or exceeded their goal for the <br />month, (and the past two years?).  And what was that HUGE deficit? <br />
<blockquote>The Army signed up 5,101 recruits. That was short of its goal of <br />5,500,&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>  for those math challenged among us that is 399 <br />less than projected.  399 is &#8220;Big&#8221; or &#8220;significant&#8221;?  </p>
<p>I think not when we find this in the very same article.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;May <br />is historically a difficult month to recruit,&#8221; said Maj. Anne Edgecomb, <br />an Army spokeswoman, citing high school graduation and other spring <br />events that tend to make it harder to attract recruits&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps had a banner month in May, signing up 2,225 recruits, <br />many more than its goal of 1,665. The Navy hit exactly its target of <br />2,709, and the Air Force met its goal of 2,451.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the Guard Units are still having some trouble recruiting.  the <br />article provided this piece of information that confirms that thought. <br />
<blockquote>The Army National Guard met 88 percent of its goal and the <br />Air National Guard met 77 percent of its goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>  All of <br />this from the WaPo <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061102170.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>The problem with CoRev&#8217;s post is that he&#8217;s looking only at this year.   <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133908/nav/tap1/">Standards have already dropped.</a>  I don&#8217;t have time to go look at a .mil site right now, but I think CoRev is ignoring a few details about military recruiting, namely that the military is ignoring a few details about a number of its recruits these days.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at spending by the federal government, subtracting off Social Security and the defense spending.  And it does it two ways.  One is as a percentage of GDP.  The other is in real dollars per person.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a few comments.  Regular readers know in the past few days I&#8217;ve been looking at federal spending, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">here in terms of number of Federal employees</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-federal-government.html">here in terms of number of Federal spending less social security as a percentage of GDP</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as a liberal who is fiscally conservative, I really don&#8217;t care about the size of government.  The question is &#8211; are we being made better off?  At times, smaller government is the way to do that.  At times, larger government is the way to do that.  (As noted on numerous other posts, the fastest annualized growth rates in the economy (whether one accounts for changes in debt or not) in the post WW2 era occured under JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations.  One increased the size of government a lot, one decreased it by more than any other President by the two measures I&#8217;ve looked at so far.</p>
<p>But small government is an article of faith to our conservative and libertarian friends, not to mention our troll who has on occasion been acting almost like one of our friends as of late.  And the fact that Clinton outperforms all the Reps, including St. Ronald the Most High Reagan, doesn&#8217;t fit with that faith.   Fortunately, all is not lost&#8230; our friends feel the test is unfair.  Spending should not include defense spending.  Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure I agree&#8230;. it seems to me, for instance, that this is an argument that we should count GW&#8217;s spending on Afghanistan, as that is spending that was thrust upon him.  The corrolary, of course, is that this means counting the spending on Iraq, which was not thrust upon him and is being run poorly, and that had Afghanistan been managed well, that war might well be over as well.  Also, some spending gets spent no matter what&#8230; and could go into military or civilian pots.  Example might include shoring up levees (had it been done) in New Orleans, or various types of satellites.  But we aim to please here at Angry Bear, so I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>The second problem our friends have identified &#8230;  dividing by GDP makes Presidents that produced better growth look better (in their eyes) when it comes to cutting spending as a percentage of GDP.   Since our friends don&#8217;t seem to accept the idea that that Democratic administrations growing faster in general was anything but a whimsical game of the gods, it is necessary to penalize those administrations that grew faster.  Well, OK, as I noted, we aim to please&#8230;  I&#8217;ll also take a look at things dividing through by population rather than GDP.</p>
<p>A final note before we begin&#8230; data on government outlays comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">OMB Table 3.1</a>, data on GDP comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">OMB Table 1.2</a>, and CPI for computing inflation comes from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">this table at the BLS</a>.  Additionally, to adjust for population, I used 2nd quarter population data for years until 1976, and 3rd quarter thereafter, to match the fiscal year ends.  Data on population came from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  But, as always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming I didn&#8217;t screw up the data, here goes&#8230;  First up, a graph of Federal Outlays less SS less Defense, all as a percentage of GDP&#8230;</p>

<p>Clinton still beats Reagan.  Even with a Democratic Congress.  And what&#8217;s this?  Carter coming in third?  That can&#8217;t be right.  But it&#8217;s OK.  We still have another measure up our sleeves that will make Reagan kick some Clinton ass and put Carter in his rightful place &#8211; at the bottom.  And here it is&#8230;.  ladies and germans, the measure of what really matters to Republicans and Conservatives and Libertarians alike&#8230; (drumrolll)&#8230;.  real (2000 dollars) federal spending not counting social security or defense expenditures, per capita.  </p>

<p>And a summary&#8230;<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fAZumkEI/AAAAAAAAAQA/kpfuyYe72TY/s1600-h/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fAZumkEI/AAAAAAAAAQA/kpfuyYe72TY/s320/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Wait.  No.  Not possible.  Every single President increased spending on non-Social Security and non-defense items per capita?  And Clinton did it by the least?  And he was actually cutting spending per capita before the Republican Congress took over?  And Reagan increased this type of spending by more than three times Clinton?  More than three times Clinton?  And Carter came in third, increasing spending per person at half, repeat, half the rate that GW did?</p>
<p>So we have two options.  One is that I made a serious mistake somewhere.  Regular readers know its happened before, and will probably happen again.  This isn&#8217;t my job, so perhaps I&#8217;m not as careful as I would be if there was a paycheck attached to the work.  You&#8217;re welcome to check my spreadsheets if you want, or to simply grab the data and do it yourself.  I&#8217;m confident if I made a mistake, someone will spot it.  I&#8217;ll have egg on my face, and try not to make another one for a long time.</p>
<p>The other option is that I didn&#8217;t make a mistake.   And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the lesson here?  I don&#8217;t know, but it seems to me that even on the one thing that is supposed to really matter to Republicans, that is unaffected (for the most part) by outside events, when looked at in ways that are intended to make Republicans look good, and when ignoring those parts and pieces that would make Republicans look bad&#8230;  even on that carefully constructed measure, Republican Presidents don&#8217;t seem to perform better than Democratic Presidents for whom this isn&#8217;t a goal.  I don&#8217;t know how to interpret this in any way except that Republican Presidents tend to either not be competent, Republican, or both.   But then, I don&#8217;t vote for them.</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan finds this interview of <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=11287">Michael Perlman</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Perlman offers another view on free market not staying free because of the nature of markets and maximization of profit.  He describes a glitch that needs addressing.  </p>
<blockquote><p>…Fixed costs are also related to but not the same thing as long-lived capital. Economists rarely pay much attention to long-lived capital, except to applaud the concept of capital accumulation. The reason for their inattention is that capital goods require considerations of time, which complicates the simple economic models with which they are enamored. Once a company has invested in such capital goods, it is stuck with them because it will not get much for its investment on secondhand markets. Companies become desperate to utilize these capital goods as efficiently as possible. </p>
<p>A large passenger airplane carrying only a couple people would be a disaster for the airline. They would have to do something to fill up their seats.</p>
<p>If all the airlines were in a similar situation, they would have no choice but to engage in the price war. This sort of competition occurred in the 19th century railroads. Bankruptcy became commonplace until J.P. Morgan began to organize them into large cartels to prevent competition.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Modern economics assumes away this tendency even though common sense shows that no really competitive industry today is very profitable. Profits are highest in industries protected by intellectual property or by the influence necessary to garner government contracts. But now, such debates have subsided. Instead, economists exude confidence that the market operates as a giant computer or even a super-brain, which allows it to ensure that business performs in the most efficient manner possible. So great is the divorce from reality that such theories persist even in the post-Enron era.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Competition affects finance in two different ways. As in the rest of the economy, competitive forces drive financial institutions to increase efficiency (in the narrow sense of improving things like the cost of handling transactions). As in the non-financial sector, the outcome tends to be consolidation, which strengthens finance.</p>
<p>At the same time, competition in the non-financial sector tends to lower the rate of profit. Investors, seeking substantial profits, lose interest in the non-financial sector and turn to purely financial operations. This particular consequence of competition helps to explain the rise of hedge funds and the relative absence of investment in productive sectors of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Dan asks&#8230;<br />Do markets have a developmental pattern inherent in the modern form?  If you are always looking for 15% return or more, does this distort the free part of the market to a particular kind of market if the excess capital simply sloshes around in financial instruments?</p>

                                <p>Some weeks ago I posted on the upcoming water crisis in the southwest US. It seems to have already arrived.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to pump water from the Great Lakes, the GL are on a down cycle that may last 50 years or so. Not a good idea.</p>
<p>And southern CA is know for heavy air pollution, which Governor Terminator is addressing with some major proposals.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Is it rational to continuing moving people into southern California?</p>
<p>Would it be more rational to create policies causing people to move out of southern CA?</p>
<p>Who would do this and how would it work?</p>
<p>Should we wait until conditions are so bad people depopulate on their own?</p>
<p>If southern CA starts to depopulate and housing prices drop, will people then begin moving back?</p>
<p>Mark Thoma has a post up today on “smart growth” and sprawl,  forcing the depopulation of southern CA could be the ultimate smart growth move – or would it be too fascist?</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the size of the federal government by way of Federal Outlays less Social Security, all as a percentage of GDP, by administration beginning with Ike. Its a follow-up of yesterday&#8217;s post looking at the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">number of Federal Employees</a>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I would hasten to add&#8230; unlike some of the other series I have looked at like growth and fiscal responsibility, on which Democrats tend to better, this is a measure of importance only to Republicans, but not to Democrats. Democrats, presumably, want the government to be of some &#8220;optimal&#8221; size &#8211; which presumably means they would make it bigger when they deem it too small to provide what they deem to be essential services, or they would make it smaller when they deem it too big and therefore too wasteful. In general, however, Republicans just want it smaller. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a warning. Yesterday I warned our more sensitive readers to avert their eyes, for the data was not kind to the Holiest St. Ronald the Reagan, and in fact showed the Devil himself to be the President who went the furthest toward reducing the size of the Federal workforce. For those who were too careless to heed my admonition yesterday, I beseech you today. Avert your eyes or you imperil your soul. </p>
<p>Surgeon General&#8217;s requirements taken care of, we can begin. Several readers pointed out in comments yesterday that Clinton may have reduced the size of the Federal workforce through the use of contractors. One could remove employees from the payroll simply by privatizing them and hiring them as contractors. Thus, it would only be fair to look at spending. Which spending? Well, all of it, less items that the President cannot control. The big one over which the President has no control is Social Security. Its a transfer payment, its easy to break out, and it operates independently from the rest of the budget. (Data on Federal Outlays and SS spending comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">OMB Table 3.1</a> and data on GDP comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">OMB Table 1.2</a>.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see the numbers. Here&#8217;s the picture&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6OJJumkDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/dPvUlp1QJRw/s1600-h/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6OJJumkDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/dPvUlp1QJRw/s320/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6N_5umkCI/AAAAAAAAAPw/LTEzmmo2y-E/s1600-h/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6N_5umkCI/AAAAAAAAAPw/LTEzmmo2y-E/s320/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Before anything else, I should note&#8230; it never fails, someone comes around erroneously arguing that its due to the Republican revolution and I have to go back and put the numbers into comments. So let me cut that off at the knees&#8230;</p>
<p>The annualized shrinkage from 1992 to 1994 was 3.26%. From 1994 to 2000 it was 2.37%. For those who can&#8217;t subtract, that&#8217;s almost a percent a year. As I keep pointing out, if Gingrich hadn&#8217;t interfered, its likely that Clinton&#8217;s performance would have been much better.</p>
<p>Which raises a question, again. Why don&#8217;t Republicans love Clinton? He had the second best economic growth in the sample (after JFK/LBJ), he was fiscally responsible, he reduced the size of government. Aren&#8217;t all these things that Republicans claim they love?</p>
<p>How can a Republican justify having voted for GW given a) Gore&#8217;s role in making the government smaller during Clinton&#8217;s term and b) GW&#8217;s rapid expansion of government &#8211; at a faster pace than even JFK/LBJ, beating out every other President. And its not like he&#8217;s done well at anything else either.</p>
<p>For extra credit, what happened after 1984 Congressional elections? </p>
<p>Anyway, gotta run. Have at it.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m always reluctant to use a partisan source for information, even more when its just providing a translation from another source I simply cannot evaluate and which may be from (horror of horrors) France. But this one has some interesting info, and I don&#8217;t have any reason to think they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>Reader Dan sends a link to <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/061107G.shtml">this</a> article (which in turn was translated from <a href="http://rue89.com/2007/06/09/hausse-de-la-production-de-coca-en-colombie">this article</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The most interesting thing about the statistics the American administration provides on coca production in Colombia every year is the way they are presented. Or not. When the figures are down, as was more or less the case up until 2005, the American drug czar &#8211; all smiles and armed with supporting tables (see below) &#8211; convokes the cameras to explain that the five billion dollars spent by taxpayers to finance Plan Colombia (military aid to Bogota to fight against cocaine) since 1999 are bearing fruit. But when production climbs, move along reporters, there&#8217;s nothing there to see. That is the case this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statistically, there has been no change in the amount of coca under cultivation between 2005 and 2006,&#8221; did we thus learn on Monday, June 4 in a press release discreetly posted online by the offices of John Walters, the aforementioned czar. Yet, when one looks a few lines down, the data seems to tell a wholly different story: The area under coca cultivation grew nine percent to reach 157,200 hectares. Fear and trembling. How can this difference be explained? &#8220;The acreage evaluated in 2006 is 19 percent more than that evaluated in 2005, and almost all the observed increase in production was in this newly-evaluated area.&#8221; Thus, there was not more coca, but they simply did a better job of looking for it. For five billion dollars, it&#8217;s only fair&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yet, two details are striking. First of all, the Office of National Drug Control Policy&#8217;s (ONDCP) press release does not venture to compare the figures for equal acreages, although that had been done the year before to explain how, then too, in spite of the increase in figures, production was, in fact, continuing to decline. Which would therefore mean &#8211; another detail that stings &#8211; that the previous year&#8217;s figures were bogus. Yet, in 2004, Walters gloated even in his blog as he presented this same data, then supposed to explain, all by itself, the genius of American policy in Colombia. At that time, they omitted any mention that the acreage evaluated did not represent even half the country&#8217;s total acreage. This year, John Walters does not seem to have even deemed it useful to open the debate with Internet users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone not believe the administration is fudging the numbers?</p>

<p>This post continues the comparison of Presidents by looking at the size of government, in this case specifically by looking at the number of gubmint employees (i.e., freeloading bureaucrats dragging down the economy). Before we go on, I would like to warn those few Angry Bears that worship at the Church of the Holiest St. Ronald the Reagan to avert your eyes for what follows must be the work of the Democrat, er, the Devil. </p>
<p>One quick disclaimer&#8230; of course, there are other ways of looking at the size of government, and no doubt we will get to some of &#8217;em. But here&#8217;s where we begin.</p>
<p>Alright. Let&#8217;s rock. All data in this post comes from the White House&#8217;s Office and Management Budget <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist17z5.xls">Table 17.5</a>. Note that the table only goes back to 1962. </p>
<p>We begin with Federal Civilian employees per thousand people&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06UJumkAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/m9R1M0WQW1E/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+picture.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06UJumkAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/m9R1M0WQW1E/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+picture.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And now a summary table&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06aJumkBI/AAAAAAAAAPo/dnby9zvxxrA/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06aJumkBI/AAAAAAAAAPo/dnby9zvxxrA/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Wassup with St. Ronald? His is one of only two administrations to increase the number of federal civilian employees. (And please&#8230; I recognize that there are long term trends out there, but I don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the Preznit doesn&#8217;t have the ability to shrink the size of gubmint if he chooses.) If he really believed gubmint was the problem, why was he trying to afflict the rest of us with more gubmint? </p>
<p>Since someone is gonna jump in and say &#8211; &#8220;No. Blasphemy. You are looking at the data the wrong way&#8221; sooner or later, let me be the one to produce the best excuse I can for the Most Holy One: what matters is not just the size of the Federal Government, but all of government. One can shrink the size of the federal government by forcing state and local governments to pick up some tasks from the federal government. Unfunded mandates and all that jazz.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, I personally suspect that the President&#8217;s ability to affect state and local government employment is fairly limited, but its the best excuse I could come up with for the Great Man. So let&#8217;s check that data too. The graph below shows all government employees per thousand population. Every last DMV worker and postal worker&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06GZumj-I/AAAAAAAAAPQ/Cbgi9jtC1uc/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+picture.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06GZumj-I/AAAAAAAAAPQ/Cbgi9jtC1uc/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+picture.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a summary table&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06Lpumj_I/AAAAAAAAAPY/ELcXCDYUr-I/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06Lpumj_I/AAAAAAAAAPY/ELcXCDYUr-I/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what do we see? Well, the Reagan looks much better when you give him credit for a lot of things he didn&#8217;t control. The size of government actually shrank under Reagan by 2% a year, enough to make him third best in Grover Norquist&#8217;s book, right after GHW and a long, long way behind the grand champeen of government shrinkers, Bill Clinton. (And before you go crediting the Republican Revolution, take another look at the graphs above and and ask yourself when Newt Gingrich came to power.) </p>
<p>All of which raises a question&#8230; why do folks like the Club for Growth and the Wall Street Journal and, well, heck, Republicans &#8211; why do they revere Reagan and hate Clinton? Let me rephrase that &#8211; why do folks who talk about smaller government, fiscal responsibility and growth revere the guy who gave us a relatively big government, big debt and slower growth (well, not slower growth relative to other Republicans, but relative to guys like Clinton and JFK/LBJ) and despise a guy who gave us relatively small government, managed to get debt to level off, and produced faster growth?</p>
<p>Personally, I think its because marketing beats product every time with a lot of people. And St. Ronnie the Reagan was all about marketing.</p>

                                <p>Reader Empiricman sends this quetion:</p>
<p>I have been following your Democrat-Republican threads at Angrybear and have an entirely different economic question I thought you might be able to clear up for me.</p>
<p>I understand offshoring and outsourcing are generally forces to increase US productivity but I am having trouble seeing the mechanism in high-skill occupations.</p>
<p>As I understand, most jobs offshored are generally replaced by 2 low income workers (isn&#8217;t this lower productivity?) at 1/3 the cost.  Then added technological costs only allow companies to recoup 1/2 of their wage differences (again, lowering productivity?).  The displaced worker usually takes a job at 2/3 the old wage (once more, lower productivity?).  Although the numbers may not be exact in every case, the trend seems to generally be true that low-income workers tend to be less productive, additional costs are introduced, and displaced workers find less productive jobs.</p>
<p>I can certainly understand how the company has an advantage with lower costs but this looks entirely like wealth redistribution (from the worker to the company &#038; customers) and almost no productivity gains.  I must admit, there is certainly a productivity gain from the low-income workers, who previously probably held even less productive jobs.  However, since most of those gains should be retianed by the foreign country, doesn&#8217;t the US bear all of the productivity losses?  Isn&#8217;t the only gain in the US simply redistribution?</p>
<p>Taken another way, there is a common instance of offshoring I have seen in IT.  An H1-B worker earning $80K is often fired and rehired in India for $20K (although he will be lucky to receive $15K).  Since there are certainly efficiency losses and infrastructure hindrances, the worker is generally less productive than before.  Since this is the simplest outsourcing example, how can there be any economic advantage to this situation?  All we have done is add waste and redistribute the worker&#8217;s wealth to the company.  I also use this example because it is quite common and I know many Indian workers who are rightfully very angry with such practices.</p>
<p>From the studies I can find, they seem to always say productivity is gained because the company produces just as much as before (with a little extra profit) and the fired worker can work at Walmart, adding a little more to the economy.  This seems to be ignoring the lost wages from the employee (and the foreign worker&#8217;s old job), as if those were not output in any sense.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>cactus here.  I could be wrong&#8230; I think this is more of an accounting issue than anything else so I&#8217;m way ignorant here, but let me try to reason this out.  Say its the year 2000, and PWC or some other big accounting firm is able to provide $1,000 of output using 1 hour of partner labor and $400 worth of output from the folks below.</p>
<p>Now, say its the year 2007, and they can produce the same $1,000 of output using 1 hour of partner labor and $50 of output from the folks below, who happen to be in India.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s $350 floating around in &#8220;productivity.&#8221;  Who gets it?  I would imagine the partners at PWC would tell you that it accrues to them for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1.  I imagine the $350 goes to the partners at PWC, not to the folks in India or whoever else<br />2.  The partners would argue that it was their innovation or leadership or mad leadership skillz in recognizing a way to save $350 that is the source of the productivity</p>

<p>Lt Gen Douglas Lute:</p>
<p>New York Times: 7 June 2007, General Tells Senate U.S. Must Prevail in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s at war and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan represent what we in the military call the main effort in the long war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Main effort means major expenditure or cost centers in long profit campaign to bankrupt America. This guy is talking about costs and tells nothing of the value we should expect. In most decision scenarios the decision makers ask what are the benefits.</p>
<p>For this administration and congress the only benefits are for their contributors in the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>Then Lute says we have no idea that what we are doing will get to &#8220;must prevail&#8221;.</p>
<p>The next Lute quote is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conditions on the ground are deeply complex and are likely to continue to evolve, meaning that we will need to constantly adapt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a misleading way of saying: what we are doing today has no connection to any outcome, other than spending scarce resources, and avoiding the inevitable defeat. There is no strategy, so operations and tactics are meaningless as well.</p>
<p>Long war is only beneficial for war profiteers.</p>
