                                <p><strong>More Consumer Confidence Surprises</strong></p>
<p>You’d think that, in the wake of the strong jobs report two weeks ago, surveys of consumer confidence would start showing some improvement.  But no, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/16/news/economy/confidence/index.htm">consumer confidence continues to fall</a>.  We’ve already had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_03_28_angrybear_archive.html#108068524916506493">thorough discussion</a> about the fact that this probably tells us little about consumer spending, but it’s still interesting news in a “huh, I wonder why?” sort of way.  Do consumers really care that much about Iraq?  That would surprise me, though I suppose it&#8217;s possible.</p>

                                <p><strong>Capacity Utilization</strong></p>
<p>Industry in the US seems to be struggling a bit in their battle to increase capacity utilization.  The Fed just released <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/Current/default.htm">data for March</a> showing capacity utilization down a bit after several months of increases.  As usual, I’ll repeat the caveat that one month of data doesn’t mean much – but it’s a piece of data that we need to keep our eyes on.  Here&#8217;s the picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cap_util.jpg"></p>
<p>Needless to say, overall capacity utilization is very low by historical standards (i.e. compared to the past 20 years or so), despite some improvement over the past year.  As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_10_19_angrybear_archive.html#106665864158427290">I’ve said before</a>, I don’t expect any serious increase in inflation until this ratio increases somewhat – which could take while.  But if this month’s decline turns out to be a small blip downward in an otherwise positive trend, maybe 6 months or a year from now I’ll start believing people who forecast an increase in inflation&#8230;</p>

                                <p><strong>Postcards from Old Europe &#8211; New meets old</strong></p>
<p>We are only about two weeks away from one of the most important things to hit Europe this year. I am of course talking about the upcoming enlargement of the EU. May 1st will see 10 countries enter the European Union. As a result, the EU will expand to 25 states and have a combined population of around 480 million people. Eight of the new EU members come from Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia), the other two are Cyprus and Malta.</p>
<p>The entry into the EU does not mean that these countries are going to introduce the Euro. Most people are forecasting Eurozone entry to be around 2009 &#8211; 2012 for the biggest accession economies (Czech Rep., Hungary and Poland) and some time later for the others. Entry into the EU means that &#8211; at the most basic level &#8211; that the new members subscribe to the basic tenets of the club as described by the &#8220;Four Freedoms&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Free movement of goods (Articles 23 to 31 of the Treaty establishing the European Community)<br />
<br />Free movement of persons (Articles 39 to 48 of the Treaty establishing the European Community)<br />
<br />Freedom to provide services (Articles 49 to 55 of the Treaty establishing the European Community)<br />
<br />Free movement of capital (Articles 56 to 60 of the Treaty establishing the European Community)</p></blockquote>
<p>If you view EU enlargement through the filter of economics you quickly start asking questions about the effects on growth, migration, the EU budget, employment and numerous other factors.</p>
<p>If we look at the aforementioned basic freedoms one by one we can easily see that most of the points are pretty uncontroversial. Free movement of goods and services or the freedom to invest somewhere isn&#8217;t something which gets Hans or Francois riled up. The reaction to the free movement of persons is much more hotly debated. It doesn&#8217;t only mean that tourism is easier, it also means that Zbigniew from Poland can now hop over the border and start work in Germany just as if he were German.</p>
<p>This does not sit well with the border countries such as Germany and Austria and they have secured the right to restrict free movement of labor for the next seven years. Most other countries have followed suit except for the UK and Ireland who have no restrictions at all (and are pretty far away anyway + have robust labor markets). </p>
<p>Why is there so much <a href="http://www.hyperdictionary.com/search.aspx?define=angst">angst</a>? Well most Old Europeans are afraid that the relatively high incomes in their countries will cause a wave of mass migration. Germany and Austria both pay very much for low skilled work as these incomes have a natural floor in form of (high) welfare entitlements. Classical theory of migration world run the numbers and find that the income differentials are so high making the decision to move from Poland to Austria a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>But is this really the case? I don&#8217;t think so. Looking around Berlin (and most other parts of this country) shows me that most of those Eastern Europeans who want to work here are here already. The other factor to keep in mind is that history shows that living standards of countries entering the EU tend to rise rather quickly. Spain, Greece and Portugal saw average incomes rise at a very fast clip after joining the European Union &#8211; this led to a net migration of zero. </p>
<p>People often speak of the &#8220;United States of Europe&#8221; and draw comparisons to the US of A. In this case they say that Americans will pack up and move if there are jobs to be had in other states &#8211; so why shouldn&#8217;t Europeans react in the same way?  I&#8217;m always suspicious of these kinds of oversimplifications. I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_04_04_angrybear_archive.html#108145678396237332">argued last week</a> that Europeans &#8211; and Germans in particular &#8211; are risk averse. This inertia extends to moving as well. Research has shown that<br />
<blockquote>By contrast, OECD figures for 1987 showed that French and German workers were only a third as likely to move between departements and Länder as US citizens between States &#8211; let alone between France and Germany themselves!<br />
<br />From <a href="http://www.europarl.eu.int/workingpapers/econ/104/chap2_en.htm#d">here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that there could be a higher incentive for workers from the new accession countries to move than there was for &#8211; say &#8211; Spaniards to migrate. The difference being the fact that average Spanish incomes were at around 70% of the EU average at the time they joined vs. 40% or so in the new members. But please keep in mind that there are very formidable obstacles in moving within the Union. Contrast the following with moving from New York to California<br />
<blockquote>Clearly, some endemic obstacles to labour mobility exist in Europe which are almost &#8211; though not entirely &#8211; absent in the US: notably differences of language and culture. Other obstacles are the result of divergent action by public authorities: for example, the non-transferability of pension rights, restrictions on the right to social security, inflexibility in housing markets, nationality restrictions on recruitment in the public sector, non-recognition of qualifications, lack of information about jobs in other Member States, etc. Progress in removing these obstacles &#8211; as in implementing the &#8220;free movement of persons&#8221; principle in general &#8211; is proving extremely slow.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why is everyone afraid? Is it simple xenophobia? Or are there other forces at work? I think general anti-immigration sentiment is strong in many European countries but I also think that the main reason people are against (im)migration is that they think there is only a fixed number of jobs to be had. This so-called &#8220;lump of labor&#8221; fallacy is also behind the idea that reducing the amount of hours worked will increase the number of employed people. There is actually no evidence I know that supports this. On the contrary: higher supply can create it&#8217;s own demand in the jobs market <strong>if</strong> labor markets are flexible.</p>
<p>I would wager that migration will not be necessary anyway &#8211; the jobs will move to where the people are. Foreign direct investment in the accession countries has been strong and will continue to get stronger as hindrances on the movement of capital are eliminated. This will lead to even more lower skilled jobs moving out of Old Europe into &#8220;New Europe&#8221; and see the establishment of a NAFTA-like production belt on the border. This could of course have bad consequences for the countries losing manufacturing jobs. </p>
<p>A look at the US shows that a large part of &#8220;lost&#8221; manufacturing jobs turned up as (lower paid) service jobs. The big difference is that in Western Europe many workers might consider two years of unemployment benefits at around 65 &#8211; 70% of last wages to be more attractive than a job in the service sector. Add in the fact that the service sector might not want to hire anyone as they will find it exceedingly difficult to get rid of their new workers in an economic downturn.</p>
<p>To sum it up: I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;ll see a wave of mass migration rolling over Western Europe after EU enlargement. What we will see is more pressure being put on governments to reform the system of entitlements and to increase the flexibility in their labor markets. The source of this pressure is to be found in the free movement of goods and capital which will accelerate the movement of manufacturing jobs to countries with lower wages.</p>

<p>Fred Kaplan <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2098861/">in Slate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Throughout that summer, we now well know, Tenet, Richard Clarke, and several other officials were running around with their &#8220;hair on fire,&#8221; warning that al-Qaida was about to unleash a monumental attack. On Aug. 6, Bush was given the now-famous President&#8217;s Daily Brief (by one of Tenet&#8217;s underlings), warning that this attack might take place &#8220;inside the United States.&#8221; &#8230; And now, we learn today, at this peak moment, Tenet hears about Moussaoui. <strong>Someone might have added 2 + 2 + 2 and possibly busted up the conspiracy. But the president was down on the ranch, taking it easy. Tenet wasn&#8217;t with him.</strong> Tenet never talked with him. Rice—as she has testified—wasn&#8217;t with Bush, either. He was on his own and, willfully, out of touch. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Meetings and Battle Stations</p>
<p>I&#8217;m beginning to better understand what Richard Clarke meant when he talked about the importance of high level meetings during high threat periods. The latest piece of this unforunate puzzle comes in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/15/politics/15PANE.html?th">today&#8217;s NYT</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>George J. Tenet and his deputies at the Central Intelligence Agency were presented in August 2001 with a briefing paper labeled &#8220;Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly&#8221;</strong> about the arrest days earlier of Zacarias Moussaoui, but did not act on the information, the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>An interim report by the panel&#8217;s staff offered a stinging assessment of the C.I.A. under Mr. Tenet&#8217;s leadership and was made public during a hearing at which Mr. Tenet disclosed that he had little contact with President Bush during much of the summer of 2001, a period when intelligence agencies were warning of a dire terrorist threat. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose that Bush and Tenet actually had a meeting in August, particularly <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/">on August 6th</a>.  Here&#8217;s how it might have played out:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>BUSH: George, today&#8217;s PDB is titled &#8220;Bin Laden determined to strike in US.&#8221; It mentions &#8220;bring the fighting to America,&#8221; Al Qaeda members who &#8220;have resided in or traveled to the U.S. for years,&#8221; hijackings, &#8220;recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York,&#8221; and &#8220;attacks with explosives.&#8221; What&#8217;s your assessment of the risk we&#8217;re facing?</p>
<p>TENET: Did you say hijackings?</p>
<p>BUSH: Yes.</p>
<p>TENET: That&#8217;s an interesting coincidence. A briefing just crossed my desk the other day warning that an Islamic extremist is taking flying lessons. I wonder if the two are related? And why would a hijacker need flying lessons?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s a lot of speculation in this. For example, the NYT only reports that the &#8220;Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly&#8221; memo was presented in August, not whether it was presented before or after August 6th. Still, if Tenet had seen the Aug. 6th PDB and received the flying lessons memo shortly thereafter, it still seems likely that he would have made a connection. It&#8217;s also unclear whether Tenet personally read the flying lessons memo; still, the NYT story makes it seem nearly certain that at least one of his deputies did. Would those deputies be included in a &#8220;Principals Meeting&#8221;? I&#8217;m not sure, but if so, there&#8217;s yet another chance for a connection to be made.</p>
<p>What if a connection had been made? At that point we would hope for some &#8220;shaking of the trees,&#8221; including disseminating warnings throughout the intelligence bureacracy to watch for and report all instances of potential extremists taking flying lessons (ideally, to Clarke, Tenet, and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/14/1612210">acting FBI Director Pickard</a>.) The extremist in question was Zacarias Moussaoui, who had raised the suspicions of the FBI&#8217;s Minneapolis field office. As FBI agent Collen Rowley <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html">recounts in detail</a>, her field office was unable to get FBI headquarters to act:<br />
<blockquote>The fact is that <strong>key FBIHQ personnel whose job it was to assist and coordinate with field division agents on terrorism investigations and the obtaining and use of FISA searches (and who theoretically were privy to many more sources of intelligence information than field division agents), continued to, almost inexplicably5 throw up roadblocks and undermine Minneapolis&#8217; by-now desperate efforts to obtain a FISA search warrant</strong>, long after the French intelligence service provided its information and probable cause became clear. HQ personnel brought up almost ridiculous questions in their apparent efforts to undermine the probable cause. In all of their conversations and correspondence, <strong>HQ personnel never disclosed to the Minneapolis agents that the Phoenix Division had, only approximately three weeks earlier, warned of Al Qaeda operatives in flight schools seeking flight training for terrorist purposes!</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, were the trees being shaken, somewhat might have recalled the <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0412042phoenix1.html">7/10/2001 memo from FBI agent Kenneth Williams</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The purpose of this communication is to <strong>advise the Bureau and New York of the posssibility of a coordinated effort by USAMA BIN LADEN (UBL) to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universites and colleges</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8230; these individuals will be in a position in the future to conduct terror activity against civil aviation targets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Would regular meetings between Tenet and Bush in August of 2001 have lead to someone connecting the dots? It&#8217;s impossible to say with any certainty. But it would have been substantially more likely. </p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&#038;node=&#038;contentId=A20349-2004Mar24&#038;notFound=true">in his testimony</a>, Clarke even explained what went wrong and how it could have gone otherwise:<br />
<blockquote> BEN-VENISTE: Well, the FBI was a principal agency upon which you had to rely, is that not the case?</p>
<p>CLARKE: It is.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: Now, with respect to what you were told &#8212; you were the principal coordinator for counterterrorism for the chief executive flowing up and down through you, correct?</p>
<p>CLARKE: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: Did you know that the two individuals who had been identified as Al Qaida had entered the United States and were presently thought to be in the country?</p>
<p>CLARKE: I was not informed of that, nor were senior levels of the FBI.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: Had you known that these individuals were in the country, what steps, with the benefit of hindsight, but informed hindsight, would you have taken, given the level of threat?</p>
<p>CLARKE: To put the answer in context, I had been saying to the FBI and to the other federal law enforcement agencies and to the CIA that because of this intelligence that something was about to happen that they should lower their threshold of reporting, that they should tell us anything that looked the slightest bit unusual.</p>
<p>In retrospect, having said that over and over again to them, for them to have had this information somewhere in the FBI and not told to me, I still find absolutely incomprehensible.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: And I will have to end it here although I&#8217;d like to go further. Was the information with respect to Moussaoui and his erratic behavior in flight school ever communicated to you?</p>
<p>CLARKE: Not to me.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: Given the fact that there was a body of information with respect to the use of planes as weapons within the intelligence community&#8217;s knowledge, had you received information about Moussaoui training to fly a commercial airplane? Would that have had some impact on the kind of efforts which might be made to protect commercial aviation?</p>
<p>CLARKE: I don&#8217;t know. The information to which you refer, information in the intelligence community&#8217;s knowledge about Al Qaida having thought of using aircraft as weapons, that information was old relatively speaking &#8212; five years, six years old &#8212; hadn&#8217;t reoccurred to my knowledge during those five or six years &#8212; and has to be placed &#8212; to give the intelligence community a break &#8212; it has to be placed in the context of the other intelligence reports.</p>
<p>CLARKE: The volume of intelligence reports on this kind of thing, on Al Qaida threats and other terrorist threats, was in the tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands over the course of the five or six years.</p>
<p>Now, in retrospect, to go back and find a report six years earlier that said perhaps they were going to use aircraft as weapons, it&#8217;s easy to do now. But I think the intelligence community analysts can be forgiven for not thinking about it given the fact that they hadn&#8217;t seen a lot in the five or six years intervening about it and that there were so many reports about so many other things.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: And yet &#8212; with your indulgence, Mr. Chairman&#8230;</p>
<p>KEAN: Short indulgence.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: And yet, an FAA advisory went out. The FAA advised on the potential for domestic hijackings.</p>
<p>CLARKE: I asked them to.</p>
<p>BEN-VENISTE: <strong>And had you known on top of that that there was a jihadist who was identified, apprehended in the United States before 9/11 who was in flight school acting erratically&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>CLARKE: <strong>I would like to think, sir, that even without the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, I could have connected those dots</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, it&#8217;s speculative to say that 9/11 could have been prevented, but regular top-level meetings would have made it much more likely. Rice may have been right when <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/4/8/93425.shtml">she said</a> that &#8220;there was no silver bullet that could have prevented&#8221; the 9/11 attack; instead it looks increasingly like a clip full of regular lead bullets might have done the job.</p>

                                <p>Housing Bubble?</p>
<p>Kevin notes a report that the &#8220;median [home] sale price [in Los Angeles is] up 29%, to a record $375,000, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homes13apr13,1,922028.story?coll=la-home-headlines">according to data</a> released Monday&#8221;  and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_04/003686.php">says</a><br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, including the happy talk analysts quoted farther down in the story: this kind of panic buying is a sign of a late-stage bubble. It&#8217;s true that bubbles usually last longer than skeptics think they will, but this one has been firing on all cylinders for a while now. I doubt there&#8217;s more than a few months or a year left before it bursts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad reads Kevin&#8217;s post and <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000632.html">says </a><br />
<blockquote>A 30% rise in local housing prices in a year in which short interest rates have not fallen and the yield curve not flattened is hard to explain as anything other than a bubble. But I still don&#8217;t see the housing bubble as covering enough of the nation to be a danger.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, young Matt Y. in DC, after reading <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0404.wallace-wells.html">this</a>, made <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002961.html">this announcement:</a><br />
<blockquote>I decided to halt my inquiries into the possibility of youthful homeownership.</p></blockquote>
<p>DC&#8217;s an odd case. I was there recently and everywhere I looked, I saw new condos being built and old boarded-up houses with &#8220;sold&#8221; signs and construction company signs on them.  On the one hand, I&#8217;ve heard that Bush&#8217;s massive spending and the creation of the Dept. of Homeland Security have increased DC&#8217;s population by 20-something thousand (about 5%). So population is up, but I&#8217;m guessing that DC&#8217;s housing capacity is growing faster than its population (which should push prices down at some point.) In any case, housing prices in DC have more than doubled over the last four or five years, and the rate of increase has shown no sign of slowing yet. </p>
<p>Also, while DC was once a pretty run down city, many areas are revitalized or revitalizing &#8212; new shops, restaurants, night life, and so on. On the other hand, crime is still high and the public schools remain notoriously bad. </p>
<p>So, knowledgeable readers: is there a housing bubble in DC? </p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/2004_04_11_atrios_archive.html#108197876240219844">Atrios</a>, from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/politics/14TEXT-PANEL.html?pagewanted=print&#038;position=">NYT</a>:<br />
<blockquote>    ROEMER: Would it have made any difference if you had mentioned &#8212; did you ever mention it, for instance, to the president &#8212; your briefing the president from August 6th on?</p>
<p>    TENET:: I didn&#8217;t see the president. I was not in briefings with him during this time. He was on vacation. I was here.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: <strong>You didn&#8217;t see the president between August 6, 2001, and September 10th?</strong></p>
<p>    TENET:: <strong>Well, no. Before &#8212; saw him after Labor Day, to be sure</strong>.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: So you saw him September 4th &#8212; at the principals&#8217; meeting?</p>
<p>    TENET:: It was not at principals&#8217; meeting.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: Well, you don&#8217;t see him&#8230;</p>
<p>    TENET:: Condoleezza Rice &#8212; Condoleezza &#8212; I saw him in this time frame, to be sure.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: OK. I&#8217;m just confused. You see him on August 6th with the PDB.</p>
<p>    TENET:: No, I do not, sir. I&#8217;m not there.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: OK. You&#8217;re not &#8212; <strong>when do you see him [Bush] in August?</strong></p>
<p>    TENET:: <strong>I don&#8217;t believe I do.</strong></p>
<p>    ROEMER: <strong>You don&#8217;t see the president of the United States once in the month of August?</strong></p>
<p>    TENET:: <strong>He&#8217;s in Texas and I&#8217;m either here or on leave for some of that time, so I&#8217;m not here.</strong></p>
<p>    ROEMER: So who&#8217;s briefing him on the PDBs?</p>
<p>    TENET:: The briefer, himself. We have a presidential briefer.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: But you never get on the phone or in any kind of conference with him to talk at this level of high chatter and huge warnings during the spring and summer to talk to him through the whole month of August?</p>
<p>    TENET:: <strong>We talked to him directly throughout the spring and early summer almost every day</strong>.</p>
<p>    ROEMER: <strong>But not in August?</strong></p>
<p>    TENET:: <strong>In this time period, I&#8217;m not talking to him, no.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/04/20040413-20.html">Bush, on Tuesday</a>:<br />
<blockquote> And of course, that concerns me. All those reports concern me. As a matter of fact, <strong>I was dealing with terrorism a lot as the President when George Tenet came in to brief me</strong>. I mean, that&#8217;s where I got my information. I changed the way that &#8212; the relationship between the President and the CIA Director. <strong>And I wanted Tenet in the Oval Office all the time. And we had briefings about terrorist threats</strong>. This was a summary.</p>
<p>&#8230; <strong>The way my administration worked, Ed, is that I met with Tenet all the time</strong>, obviously met with my principals a lot. We talked about threats that had emerged. We had a counterterrorism group meeting on a regular basis to analyze the threats that came in. Had there been a threat that required action by anybody in the government, I would have dealt with it. In other words, had they come up and said, this is where we see something happening, you can rest assured that the people of this government would have responded, and responded in a forceful way.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Bush meant to add, &#8220;except, of course, when I&#8217;m on vacation.&#8221; But, &#8220;with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer,&#8221; it didn&#8217;t &#8220;pop into [his] head.&#8221; </p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/ap/20040414/ap_on_bi_ge/deficit_impacts_1">WASHINGTON </a>&#8211; Uncontrolled U.S. budget deficits would pose a serious threat to global prosperity in coming years as rising interest rates depress economic growth in the United States and around the world, the International Monetary Fund (news &#8211; web sites) warned Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>The IMF released a new analysis that predicted if nothing is done to get control of the soaring U.S. deficits, it would shave global economic output by 4.2 percent by 2020 and reduce U.S. economic growth by 3.7 percent during the same period.</strong></p>
<p>IMF economists said much of the adverse impact would occur because of increased borrowing demands in the United States to finance the budget deficit. This would drive up U.S. interest rates and interest rates in other countries as the global supply of available capital is reduced, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of the world is affected seriously by the U.S. fiscal deficit,&#8221; IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajan told reporters in a briefing on the new report.</p>
<p>The IMF&#8217;s forecast that the U.S. budget deficit will be a significant drag on growth reflected what will occur if there is no improvement in the deficit, which the Bush administration projects will hit $521 billion this year, a record in dollar terms, and show little improvement in coming years. </p></blockquote>

                                <p><strong>The Lost Art of Diplomacy</strong></p>
<p>In Iraq, the standoff between Sadr&#8217;s militias in Najaf and 2500 US Army troops (and their tanks, artillery, and air support) is a tense and extremely dangerous one.  However, it looks like some careful diplomacy by an Iranian delegation may be easing the situation there.  The Iranians, being from the only Shiite-ruled country in the world, have special influence with the Shiite community in Iraq.  Happily, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/afp/20040414/wl_mideast_afp/iraq_worldwrap&#038;cid=1514&#038;ncid=1473">news reports</a> are saying that since the Iranian delegation has arrived in Najaf to try to diffuse the situation, Sadr has relented on many of his most contentious demands.</p>
<p>So why do I refer to diplomacy as a &#8220;lost art&#8221;?  Because it turns out that the only reason the Iranians are so helpfully mediating in the standoff is because the <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/afp/20040414/pl_afp/us_iraq_unrest_iran&#038;cid=1521&#038;ncid=1473">British asked them to</a>.  If it hadn&#8217;t been for the initiative of the British diplomatic corps, it seems likely that no negotiated progress would be being made, and that there would be no possibility of a peaceful resolution to the standoff.  To the Bush administration, diplomacy is indeed a lost art.  Whatever small diplomatic successes do happen in Iraq are despite the Bush administration&#8217;s efforts, not because of them.</p>

                                <p><strong>CPI Release</strong></p>
<p>The BLS just released the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">CPI data for March</a>.  It shows a surprisingly large increase in prices: +0.4% for consumer items excluding food and energy.  That means that prices have increased over the past 12 months by 1.6%, which is the fastest rate of price increase since mid-2001.  Even the chained core CPI is rising.  The chart below tells the story.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi2.jpg"></p>
<p>This data reinforces what I <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_04_11_angrybear_archive.html#108177864531134442">said the other day</a>: I think the danger of deflation is behind us.</p>
