                                <p><strong>The Downside of Low Interest Rates</strong><br />
<br /> <br />
<br />In today’s commentary <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/latest-digest.html">Stephen Roach</a> takes on the subject of low real interest rates.  His argument is that by keeping real interest rates so low for so long (short term real rates have actually been negative for a couple of years now) in order to stimulate the economy, the Fed creates other problems.  These potential problems take the form “carry trades” – the practice of borrowing at low short term interest rates and then turning around and immediately lending the money out at higher long term interest rates – and asset price bubbles.  Both of these in turn entail their own set of risks to the economy.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />So if these are indeed potential problems, what should the Fed do?  Well, it all depends on your priorities, or what you think the Fed&#8217;s objectives should be.  Should the Fed&#8217;s goal be to alleviate current unemployment?  Should they try to maximize long-run economic growth?  Should they worry only about the rate of inflation of consumer prices, or should they also worry about asset prices?  If the latter, how should they decide when rising asset prices change from being good to being bad?<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />There’s no right answer to these questions.  I would suggest that the goal of the current Board of Governors of the Fed is primarily to keep the inflation faced by consumers low while avoiding deflation, and then secondarily to improve the current employment situation, where that secondary goal doesn’t conflict with the primary goal.  But Roach is arguing,  in effect, that trying to boost current employment may in fact endanger long run economic growth, because the concomitant asset price bubbles that are allowed to grow in the process of boosting current employment cause economic problems down the road.  If that&#8217;s the case then the Fed is faced with an unpleasant tradeoff: help the economy now at the cost of hurting it in the future, or vice versa.  Not an easy dilemma to resolve.<br />

<p><i>Odd, then, that <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/invest/extra/P83603.asp">CEO pay rose 27% in 2003,</a> isn&#8217;t it?  Did the supply of CEOs shrink last year?  Did demand skyrocket?<br />

<p><i>Is this the free market at work? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m told. So I have a contest in mind: a prize for the least laughable explanation for why CEO pay has gone up 7x since 1980 based on supply and demand. At a minimum, winning entries should explain the following:<br />
<br /></i>   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Why the supply of CEOs has decreased.</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Why the demand for CEOs has increased.</i></p>

<p><i>Grand prize to be announced at a future date.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i> </i>I&#8217;ve always viewed skyrocketing CEO pay as the result of a variety of factors, some justified and some not, so I&#8217;ll give it a shot:<br />

<ol>
<li>Governance reforms at the end of the 1980s that lead to the substitution of salary-based pay with equity-based incentive pay. This came about mostly because of the wave of corporate takeovers: a company was ripe for a takeover when it was managed to accomplish something other than maximizing shareholder value. Since the CEO&#8217;s income was not tied directly to the company&#8217;s performance, they made a lot of bad decisions. So boards began using equity-based pay. This had several effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It replaced risk-free income with risky income, which entails increasing expected pay to compensate for the greater risk premium.</li>
<li>By design, equity-based compensation will encourage CEOs to (at least try to, and on average but clearly not always succeed) make better decisions, as viewed from a shareholder&#8217;s perspective. When CEOs make better decisions, profits go up. When CEO income is tied to profits, their income goes up.</li>
<li>Incentive pay, by design, induces more effort (it&#8217;s why commissioned sales people tend to work harder and usually make more than non-commissioned ones.) More effort lowers utility and additional income is required to compensate.</li>
<li>Evidence: <a href="http://www.financeprofessor.com/summaries/JensenandMurphy1990.htm">Jensen and Murphy found</a> in 1990 that on average, &#8220;CEO wealth changes by $3.25 per $1000 of shareholder value. This is $8.05 for small firms and $1.85 for large firms.&#8221; A 1998 follow up found that this increased to $18.00 per $1000 of added shareholder wealth over the course of the 1990s.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p></li>
<li>Coincidence: CEO pay was tied to corporate performance and for a variety of reasons (possibly including better governance), the stock market boomed. Since pay was tied to stock-price and stock prices were skyrocketing, CEO pay necessarily soared. This explains much of the surge in CEO pay in the 1990s. Regarding 2003, that was the year that corporate profits and stock prices started recovering from the bust that started in 2000, so if pay is tied to profits and stock price, it&#8217;s not surprising that pay increased. (On the other hand, this implies that pay should have decreased in 2000-2002, which it did not.)
</li>
<li>Lake Woebegon: Every company wants to think it has an above-average CEO, and pay him or her accordingly. A typical compensation committee report will say something like, &#8220;we aim to pay our CEO in 60th-75th percentile for the industry.&#8221; When all companies try to keep their CEO pay in the top 25% to 40%, the result is predictable.
</li>
<li>A poorly functioning market for compensation consultants and poorly informed compensation committees. Compensation committees only get the information the CEO wants them to have, and are often chosen by the CEO. So they turn to consulting firms for information. These compensation consulting firms want to be hired right now, and they want to be rehired in the next year, and they are fully aware that the CEO will heavily influence the rehiring decision. Not surprisingly, the advice they give typically says to throw wads of cash at the CEO. Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, in their typical colorful fashion, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/03/pf/buffett_qanda/">explained the situation</a> a few months back:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The typical large company has a compensation committee,&#8221; said Buffett. &#8220;They don&#8217;t look for Dobermans on that committee, they look for chihuahuas.&#8221; </p>
<p> He paused amid laughter, then added: &#8220;Chihuahuas that have been sedated.&#8221; </p>
<p> Munger interjected: &#8220;I would rather throw a viper down my shirtfront than hire a compensation consultant.&#8221;   <!--startclickprintexclude--><!--endclickprintexclude--> </p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Stock options encourage more risk taking because of their skewed payoffs (either zero or positive, but not negative.) As a result, we observe the pay of CEOs that gamble and win, while CEOs that gamble and lose are replaced. Imagine getting your impression of the lottery only from reading the newspaper: people win all the time and you never read that John Smith bought 200 tickets and didn&#8217;t win a dime.
</li>
<li>If firms are choosing their CEO from within more than in the past (which I&#8217;m not sure is the case) then there&#8217;s a tournament value to high CEO pay: it induces very high effort and careful decision making from all candidates within top management. Recent examples include Jack Welch&#8217;s successor at GE, Jeffrey Immelt, and Lou Gerstner&#8217;s successor at IBM, Sam Palmisano. In both cases, for several years leading up to each succession there was in fact sharp internal competition for the spot. (Incidentally, while there are many instances of CEO compensation levels that are patently absurd, it&#8217;s pretty tough to argue that Welch or Gerstner were overpaid. Though there was a flap over <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wsw/news/welchaboutface.html">Welch&#8217;s retirement package</a>.) Craig Barrett&#8217;s replacing Andy Grove at Intel is another example.
</li>
<li>Pure opportunism: CEOs have access to better information than the board, and they exercise such great control over the board, that they are able to transfer massive amounts of wealth from shareholders to themselves.<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>Within this list, I think that (1) plays a larger role than most people think. That is, I think that CEO pay should be much higher when it&#8217;s tied to performance (post-1990, roughly) than when it&#8217;s salary based. Since the switch to performance-based pay was much more dramatic for CEOs than other workers, it&#8217;s even justified that their pay increased much faster than their underlings. (6) is also a reason for higher pay, but I think its importance is second order. (2) is a historical accident, for the most part. </p>
<p> All that said, (3), (4), and (7) are genuinely big problems and combine to account for the bulk of the unjustified rise in CEO pay. With no real theory or data at hand to justify this, I&#8217;d say the split is about 50-50: roughly half the increase is the reasonable result of structural change in the market for and compensation of CEOs; the other half is due to informational asymmetries and other failures in the market for CEOs. Eliminating that second half would be a good thing &#8212; unless you&#8217;re a CEO.</p>
<p> AB</p>
<p><small>UPDATE: Kevin points out that I failed to<strike> phrase my answer in the form of a question</strike> mention supply and demand in my answer. In general,things that make it less pleasant to be a CEO, like higher risk premia and higher effort costs, are tantamount to an inward shift of the supply curve: CEOs will require more pay for any given quantity of effort. </p>
<p>Similarly, the other factors &#8212; weak boards, asymmetric information, &#8230; &#8212; act as a shfit out in demand. In particular, as compared to firms without those problems, such firms are paying more for a given quantity of CEO effort and quality. E.g., with perfect information and correct incentives, a board might pay a CEO either $1m for 50 units of effort or $2m for 75 units of effort (draw that curve). Now consider a board plagued with bad information and bad incentives. It might pay $1.5m and $3m for the same respective amounts of CEO effort (draw that curve). The result is in fact a shifted out demand curve. Another way to see this is to note that a shift from a world of rational people to a world of chronic overpayers is just like a shift out of the demand curve.</small></p>

                                <p>Economics and Replicability</p>
<p>The key element of any true empirical result is replicability. If a result is not reproducible, then the purported effect was almost surely the result of either random chance, error, or fraud. This is not limited to the social sciences, of course. Two fairly famous incidents from the natural sciences highlight the importance of replicability in sorting out knowledge from nonsense One of the more famous <a href="http://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/news_articles/profusion_ut_042804.htm">erroneous claims was the announcement</a> by researchers at the University of Utah that they had successfully produced cold fusion. In fairly short order, other scienteists tried and failed to replicate cold fusion and cold fusion was discredited.</p>
<p> More recently, a famous researcher Lucent&#8217;s Bell Labs was caught <a href="http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-8/iss-6/p12.html">engaging in outright fraud</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Yet recently, an internal report from Lucent Technologies’ Bell Laboratories concluded that data in 16 published papers authored by researcher Hendrik Schön were fraudulent. The papers were reviewed and accepted by several prestigious scientific journals, including <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i>, <i>Physical Review</i>,                and <i><a href="http://ojps.aip.org/aplo/">Applied Physics Letters</a></i>. Yet, in many of the papers, the fraud was obvious, even to an untrained eye, with data repeated point-for-point and impossibly smooth or noise-free. All the papers passed through internal review at Bell Labs, one of the world’s foremost industrial research institutions, and the journal peer review system without raising alarms. The fraud was discovered only after journal readers started pointing it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Angry Bear contributer <a href="http://curryblog.blogspot.com/2004_07_01_curryblog_archive.html#108982776533552571">Karsten alerts me</a> to a blog by an economics professor at Southern Utah, David Tufte, who wrote <a href="http://voluntaryxchange.typepad.com/voluntaryxchange/2004/07/uh_oh.html">a post</a> titled, &#8220;Uh-Oh&#8221;:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>In short, 1) economists publish papers with results that are not replicable, and 2) few make enough effort to notice. </p></blockquote>
<p>In turn, Tufte is referencing &#8220;<a href="http://economics.sbs.ohio-state.edu/jmcb/jmcb/03208/03208.pdf">Lessons from the JMCB Archive</a>&#8221; by B.D. McCullough, Kerry Anne McGeary, and Teresa D. Harrison (<a href="http://webmail.econ.ohio-state.edu/john/GenInfo.php">Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking</a>, forthcoming.) Beginning in 1996, the JMCB implemented a policy of requiring authors publishing empirical results to submit both the data and the code used to generate the results in the paper. </p>
<p> McCullough, McGeary, and Harrison examined the archive and found that<br />

<ul>
<li>Out of 193 papers with empirical results, only 69 authors had followed the stated policy and submitted anything to the archive.<br />
</li>
<li>Of those 69, eleven submitted data but not the code used to generate their results, and 58 submitted both.<br />
</li>
<li>After corresponding with authors, they were eventually able to get sufficient data and code to attempt to replicate 62 published results.<br />
</li>
<li>In their 62 replication attempts, McCullough, McGeary, and Harrison succeeeded in only 14 instances, or 22% of the time. </li>
</ul>
<p> Now this all looks fairly damning, and to some extent it is. McCullough, McGeary, and Harrison blame this on bad incentives: because there is virtually no market for publishing results that are simply replications of previous results, there is little incentive for economists to engage in replication. Because other economists are unlikely to attempt replication, researchers have little incentive to ensure that their research is in fact replicable (often, this is more a matter of carefully archiving data and commenting programs than an issue of honesty or dishonesty.)</p>
<p> However, I think their paper overstates the extent of the problem. In particular, they correctly note that there is little incentive to publish results that are just replications. However, I think they understate the amount of unobserved replication that occurs. Isaac Newton once said, &#8220;If I have seen farther than others, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants.&#8221; Emprical economics proceeds in similar fashion: the bulk of published papers adapt and refine earlier analyses in order to test new therories, take advantage of increased computing power, or to implement new econometric methodologies. Speaking from experience, each of these will typically entail an incidental replication, as a starting point. Of course, the final published result is not the replication, but the new result. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got more to say on this subject, but this post is already long and right now I need to go generate some hopefully reproducible results. I&#8217;ll try to come back to this topic later this week. </p>

                                <p><strong><em>Clear Channel Entertainment</em> Compares Bush to Hitler</strong> <br />
<br /><strong></strong> <br />
<br />You may recall the castigation MoveOn.org recieved after two entries to its <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/">Bush in Thirty Seconds</a> ad contest compared Bush to Hitler. For the record, the entries were simply uploaded to MoveOn&#8217;s site without any screening; when MoveOn was alerted to the entries in question, <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/01/07/moveon_ads/index.html">they were removed</a>. The point of the fuss and furor over the original ads was to imply that MoveOn itself &#8212; and by extension, Kerry &#8212; was comparing Bush to Hitler.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Later, in an cynical twist, the Bush campaign <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-06-27-bush-hitler-ad_x.htm">put the images of Hitler from the two MoveOn submissions into an anti-Kerry ad</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Adolf Hitler&#8217;s image has surfaced again in the White House race. President Bush&#8217;s campaign contains online video, removed from a liberal group&#8217;s Web site months ago and disavowed, that features the Nazi dictator. </p>
<p>The Bush Internet video, which was sent electronically to 6 million supporters, intersperses clips of speeches by Democrats John Kerry, Al Gore and Howard Dean with the footage of Hitler. </p>
<p>Democrats want the video pulled from the site. Campaign aides said it would remain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Hitler juxtaposition count so far entails<br />

<ol>
<li>Two thirty second ads created by some random guys out there somewhere and uploaded to MoveOn, and then removed. Democrats in general were blamed (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,107426,00.html">here&#8217;s RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie</a>: &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of tactics we&#8217;re seeing on the left today in support of these Democratic presidential candidates.&#8221;)<br />
</li>
<li>An ad created and distributed by the Bush campaign; while there was some cry and furor, it paled in comparison to the MoveOn hullabaloo. </li>
</ol>
<p>And now we have another, this time by <a href="http://blogger.com/app/www.clearchannel.com"> Clear Channel Entertainment</a>. Via <a href="http://www.rogerailes.blogspot.com/">Roger Ailes</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote> &#8220;War Pigs,&#8221; the opener, was the best song of the set and the entire day. To double the force of the music, the giant screens next to the stage showed pictures of President Bush juxtaposed with pictures of Hitler. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/arts/music/16OZZ.html">Here is the NYT OZZfest review</a> from which Ailes draws the quote, and here <a href="http://www.clearchannel.com/Entertainment/PressReleases/2004/20040220_Ent_OzzFest.pdf">is Clear Channel&#8217;s press release</a> (pdf) announcing OZZfest. Surely Clear Channel&#8217;s  sponsoring a festival that compares Bush to Hitler entails no less culpability, and probably more, than MoveOn&#8217;s allowing anyone to upload an entry to an ad contest.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />So I <a href="http://www.rogerailes.blogspot.com/2004_07_11_rogerailes_archive.html#109008861356588140">join Roger Ailes</a> in anxiously awaiting the next round of outrage.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Of course, given that Clear Channel <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:3VCuA1CQvQ0J:www.dailyiowan.com/news/2003/03/27/Nation/ProWar.rallies.For.America.Raise.Questions-400786.shtml&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;strip=1">sponsored pro-war rallies in the spring of 2003</a> and, as of 3/23/04, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-03-23-clear_x.htm">had given $24 to Bush for ever $1.00 it gave to Kerry</a>, we might be waiting a while.(*)<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />AB<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />(*) Conservative bloggers, if they say anything, will likely say that Ozzy is to blame, not Clear Channel.  That actually sounds reasonable to me, but if they make that claim, I hope to see them similarly exonerate MoveOn (and, where relevant, retract their earlier condemnations.) </p>

<p>Apparently, the human eye and brain don&#8217;t really care what order the letters of a word are in:<br />
<br />

<p>Pretty neat. For me at least, the reordered short words are harder to read than the shuffled long words, presumably because when the letters in a shorter word are reordered, the resulting string calls to mind more than one word.<br />

                                <p><strong>Anti-Terrorism History Repeating Itself?</strong><br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The FBI is apparently adopting some new tactics in the fight against terror.  From a front page story in today’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56080-2004Jul16.html">Washington Post</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><strong>Interviews Of Muslims To Broaden<br />
<br /></strong>FBI Hopes to Avert a Terrorist Attack<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />FBI agents have launched a series of interviews of Muslims and Arab Americans in the Washington area and across the country, hoping to glean information that could prevent a major terrorist attack during this election year.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />A few dozen voluntary interviews of community leaders, students, businesspeople and others have been conducted so far, according to attorneys and Muslim activists. Authorities said they do not know how many people will be contacted, but the effort is expected to expand significantly in the next week or so. <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The new round of questioning is also far more targeted than an earlier program of voluntary interviews with men from Arab and Muslim countries, which followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was criticized for being ineffective and using profiling…</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this a sound and effective anti-terrorism tactic?  Looking at past anti-terrorism efforts by the US government is instructive in answering this question.  <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Consider anti-terrorism efforts during the mid 1990s.  Astonishingly, the story quoted above is nearly <em>identical,</em> word for word<em>,</em> to a story that was on the front page of the Washington Post in 1996, two years after the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><strong>Interviews Of Christians To Broaden<br />
<br /></strong>FBI Hopes to Avert a Terrorist Attack<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />FBI agents have launched a series of interviews of Christians and Irish-Americans in the Washington area and across the country, hoping to glean information that could prevent a major terrorist attack during this election year.<br />
<br />  <br />
<br />A few dozen voluntary interviews of community leaders, students, business people and others have been conducted so far, according to attorneys and Christian activists. Authorities said they do not know how many people will be contacted, but the effort is expected to expand significantly in the next week or so. <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The new round of questioning is also far more targeted than an earlier program of voluntary interviews with men of Irish and Christian backgrounds, which followed the 1994 terrorist attack in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh and was criticized for being ineffective and using profiling.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The questions being posed vary widely, according to attorneys, activists and interviewees. Several people in California and Arizona have been asked whether they knew anyone who had recently been in Michigan or Montana, known to be home to some of the most radical of the US’s right wing militia groups.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />&#8220;We were told by the FBI agents that they&#8217;re concerned there could be a coming threat from people who are recent converts to Christianity,&#8221; said Stacy Tolchin, a San Francisco lawyer who accompanied an Irish immigrant to an interview this week.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Law enforcement officials decided to step up efforts to contact Christians and Americans of European descent because of intelligence reports that right wing Christian militia groups are planning a large-scale attack in coming months in the United States, Attorney General Janet Reno said recently.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />&#8220;While we currently lack precise knowledge about when, where and how they are planning to attack, we are actively working to gain that knowledge,&#8221; Reno said in a news release July 9. &#8220;As part of that effort, we are again reaching out to partners in the Christian community for any information they may have.&#8221;<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Law enforcement officials appear to be using different approaches in the interviews. In some cases, they have asked prominent local Christian figures to simply pass on any helpful information, activists said. William Ryan, a Christian attorney in Washington who was visited by two FBI agents about a week ago, said they noted that he had represented various Christian organizations and charities and asked, &#8220;Is there anything we need to know?&#8221; He said he assured them that there was not.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Other interviews are highly specific. James Miller, a Christian activist in St. Louis, accompanied a U.S. graduate student of German descent to an interview with the FBI this week. The student was asked about Christian groups based in Michigan or Montana and whether he knew people who had been in contact with the Christian Coalition or who subscribed to Soldier of Fortune magazine.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The young man did not have such information, Miller said.<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />&#8220;I recognize the FBI are in a tough spot. They&#8217;re just trying to do their job. They have information they want to investigate,&#8221; Miller said. But he added that he was uneasy that a U.S.-born person was singled out. The young man declined to offer information about people he knew. </p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, perhaps I’m just imagining this variant on today’s story, and the 1996 version never really happened.  That’s probably because such an anti-terrorism plan would at a minimum have been derided as ineffective back in 1996, and more likely would have been deemed to be offensive harassment of conservative Christian individuals and organizations by the Clinton administration. <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />In many ways today&#8217;s situation is different, of course.  But not in all ways.<br />

                                <p><strong>Sloppy Reporting from the New York Times</strong><br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The New York Times is having difficulty correctly reporting the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/17/politics/campaign/17poll.html?hp">results of their own poll </a>today.  The headline of the article reads “<strong>No Poll Boost from Edwards</strong>.”  Yet the poll results show the Kerry/Bush numbers (including Nader as an option) changing from 42/ 43 to 45/42 between late June and last week.  That’s a four point shift in support, which is greater than the poll’s 3% margin of error.  Toward the end of the article they also include the following contradictory statements:<br />
<br /> <br />
<br />
<blockquote>The Times/CBS News poll, like other recent polls, found the race to be close, within its margin of error. In a head-to-head matchup, the Kerry-Edwards ticket was supported by 49 percent of registered voters, and a Bush-Cheney ticket by 44 percent… [The poll] has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. </p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, it’s true that Kerry’s lead is within the margin of error when Nader is included,  but it’s not when Nader is excluded, so the blanket statement that the race is “within its margin of error” is misleading, or at least sloppy.<br />
<br /> <br />

                                <p>Kerry&#8217;s Cabinet</p>
<p>Bruce Bartlett, a conservative columnist for The National Review,  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/brucebartlett/bb20040716.shtml">ponders who should comprise </a>the economic team in a Kerry cabinet. Typically, I disregard or at least heavily discount advice from conservatives on what Democrats should do. For example, conservative NYT columnist David Brooks often waxes on about what Democrats should do to appeal to &#8220;real&#8221; Americans (notwithstanding the fact that <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/ArticleDisplay.php?id=350">Brooks basically made-up</a> his version of real America), and his advice is invariably bad, if not disingenuous. But I digress.</p>
<p> Back to Bartlett, I see little if anything to disagree with in his recommendations to Kerry. Some Democrats or economists may want the members shuffled around a bit or have slightly diffferent preferences, but all in all, it&#8217;s a good list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Department of State:   Felix Rohatyn, Richard Holbrooke, or Sen. Joe Biden <state><place></place></state></li>
<li>Department of the Treasury:   Roger Altman</li>
<li>Office of Management and Budget:   John Spratt
</p>
</li>
<li>National Economic Council:   Steve Rattner</li>
<li>Council of Economic Advisers:   Alan Blinder; &#8220;potential CEA members would include economists Bill Gale and Peter Orszag&#8221;</li>
<li>U.S. Trade Representative:   Gene Sperling or Lael Brainard</li>
<li>Federal Reserve: &#8220;Alan Greenspan will retire at some point in the next four years, giving Kerry the ability to replace him. Former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin will be at the top of the list of potential chairmen. &#8220;</li>
<li>Department of Commerce:   Laura Tyson</li>
<li>Department of Labor: &#8220;The unions will demand that Dick Gephardt be given this slot to protect their interests. Should he turn it down, labor economists Lawrence Katz or Harry Holzer are possibilities.&#8221;</li>
<li>Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy: &#8220;Sarah Bianchi, Kerry&#8217;s top policy adviser, is a sure thing unless she desires something better.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>AB</p>
<p> P.S. Bartlett also wrote that he &#8220;won&#8217;t be voting for Kerry&#8221;; not mentioned is whether he&#8217;ll be voting for Bush (I suspect not).<br /></p>

                                <p><strong>New Inflation Data</strong><br />
<br /> <br />
<br />Yesterday’s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.toc.htm">PPI release</a> and today’s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">CPI release</a> from the BLS suggest that the growth in inflation (excluding the effects of oil prices) may already be tapering off in the economy.  Prices of producer fell in June thanks to lower energy prices, while consumers continued seeing higher prices for both energy and non-energy items. <br />
<br /> <br />
<br />The slightly surprising thing is that in both cases the inflation rates for goods other than food and energy products showed signs of slowing.  The 12-month change in consumer prices through June 2004 was just under 2.0%, which is where it has been for the past few months.  Here’s the chart: <br />
<br /> <br />
<br /><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_june.jpg"><br /> <br />
<br />This is both good and bad.  It’s good if it gives real earnings a chance to rise (which happens if earnings rise faster than prices).  Of course, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/07/anonymous-economist-real-wages-are.html">that&#8217;s a big if</a>.  But it may be a bad sign if it is a symptom of an economy that is losing steam, as yesterday&#8217;s report on <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/G17/Current/default.htm">industrial production</a> may have also suggested.  Personally, I would like to see inflation rise a bit more – not because I like inflation, but because that would be a symptom of a strong economy that can generate strong and sustained job growth.  But of course achieving that requires some good macroeconomic management.  Which is something that the US currently sorely lacks.  <br />
