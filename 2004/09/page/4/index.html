                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Joseph Stiglitz is editor of <em>The Economists’ Voice </em>and has <a href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol1/iss1/art2">this article</a> in its inaugural edition.  He notes that long-term fiscal stimulus crowds out investment – a theme he also dubs <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/reverse-rubinomics.html">Rubinomics</a>.  He further notes that the Bush tax cuts have provided little short-term stimulus for reasons similar to what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/why-bushs-tax-cuts-failed.html">Kash</a> noted.  </p>
<p>Stiglitz also noted that investment demand tends to follow opportunities where the return is highest, which appears to many to be in places like China.  Indeed China is enjoying an investment led boom, which is being partly financed by a current account surplus.  My question is why is the United States not exporting more to China as it appears we are suffering from weak exports.  </p>
<p>Co-editor <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000213.html">Brad DeLong</a> summarizes all four paper in this inaugural edition, including one of his own. </p>
<p><strong>Update: The Chinese Investment Boom (I misspoke)</strong></p>
<p>As I was asking commenting on Stiglitz’s paper, I queried why the U.S. is not exporting more to China given Stiglitz’s observation that China has an investment boom.  Thanks to Calmo for reminding me of the fixed exchange rate mercantilism being practiced by their Central Bank (as well as other Asian Central Banks).  </p>
<p>But the error of suggesting a current account surplus is financing investment in part deserves me harsh criticism from anyone who does not write for NRO.  Let me correct myself for noting some Chinese GDP data for 2002 from <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/aag/chn_aag.pdf">this source</a>:</p>
<p>National savings as a share of GDP = 43.8%<br />
<br />Investment as a share of GDP = 41%</p>
<p>China is therefore running a current account surplus equal to approximately the difference as they save more than they invest per the World Bank data.  Exports as a share of GDP were 29.5%.  And the World Bank is suggesting real per capita growth of 8% per year for a sustained period of time.  I have seen some that doubt the reliability of Chinese GDP statistics.  Any thoughts on what the World Bank is reporting?  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Gwen Ifill hosts a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec04/policy_9-14.html">discussion</a> between Robert Barro and Robert Reich, which began with a discussion of real GDP and the labor market.  Barro opens with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The economy has been doing quite well of late, particularly the GDP growth has been over 4 percent since early in 2003. Investments grown strongly, productivity has grown strongly. The labor market was lagging for some period, but of late the labor market has also been doing well in terms of job growth and in terms of reductions in the unemployment rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reich comes back with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, although Professor Barro, Gwen, is correct about overall economic growth, the fact of the matter is that with regard to jobs and wages, and also health care, these are things that obviously matter most to average families, the economy has performed very poorly. And the poor performance has continued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reich continues as one would hope on the labor front and Barro tries to counter what Reich said.  But I have to object to the premise that 4.5% growth over the three-year period from mid-2000 to mid-2003 followed by 4.7% growth over the following year is “doing quite well”. </p>
<p>The discussion moved on to deficits and the tax cuts. Barro starts off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the tax cutting program of 2003 was very successful, much more than the previous program in 2001. The important thing about the 2003 program is that it moved forward the reductions in marginal income tax rates and it also cut some of the tax rates on income from capital, particularly in terms of dividends, capital gains. Thereby I think the 2003 program was very much in favor of incentives, incentives for work, productivity, investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reich counters with noting that structural deficits have risen substantially but he never relates this realization to crowding-out of investment.  Barro gets to then claim he’s now a Keynesian.</p>
<blockquote><p>ROBERT BARRO: Let me say first, I have some agreement with respect to the 2001 tax cut, but probably for different reasons. I don&#8217;t think it was a very good program. I think it was basically giving money to people in a Keynesian way, it had a phased in schedule of reduced marginal rates&#8230;<br />
<br />GWEN IFILL: Excuse me. For those of us who are not economists, what do you mean &#8220;in a Keynesian way?&#8221;<br />
<br />ROBERT BARRO: It was basically giving money to people in hope they would spend it on consumption and raise demand.<br />
<br />The 2003 tax cut is much more about incentives, incentives for investment, incentives for productivity improvement, incentives for work, and that&#8217;s why I think the 2003 program was much more successful.<br />
<br />GWEN IFILL: Okay. What about the deficit?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Ifill is giving Reich another opening.  So what does he do?  Notes that spending has increased – to which Barro agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>The difference between now and the late &#8217;80s and the &#8217;90s is when there was a deficit, it provided a lot of fiscal restraint, holding down spending levels. It doesn&#8217;t yet seem to be working that way today, that&#8217;s the thing that troubles me. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would hope higher spending troubles Professor Barro but why could not either economist note that increases in government spending along with tax-induced increases in consumption will crowd-out investment and lower long-term growth?<br /></p>

                                <p>We heard three very different positions on Iraq from the Republicans this weekend.</p>
<p>Let me start with the grown-up GOP position expressed by Sen. Lindsey Graham on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0409/19/le.00.html">Late Edition</a></p>
<blockquote><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, I&#8217;ve been to Iraq twice, and the one thing I constantly hear is that we have enough troops. But I really don&#8217;t buy that. And I think the security situation in Iraq is going to get worse before it gets better. There&#8217;s a rhyme or reason to what&#8217;s happening here. They&#8217;re attacking police stations. They&#8217;re attacking people who want to join the army. They&#8217;re trying to kill people who want to be part of a democratic government. The terrorists are trying to drive people out. They&#8217;re trying to overcome this move to democracy, so it&#8217;s going to be tough in the short term. I don&#8217;t believe that we&#8217;re playing politics here with military actions. I do believe that the political atmosphere in the United States is a reality, and we&#8217;re just going to have to suffer through it. I want the Iraqi people to know, come November, regardless of who the president is going to be, that we&#8217;re going to stand with you. That when Prime Minister Allawi comes here and speaks to the Congress, I wish Democrats and Republicans both would tell him, no matter what it takes, if we need to have more, we will send more. We&#8217;ve got to win in Iraq.<br />
<br />BLITZER: Are you suggesting, Senator Graham, the U.S. simply does not have enough forces on the ground in Iraq right now to get the job done?<br />
<br />GRAHAM: I think we&#8217;re going to need more people over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other extreme is the cut and run position expressed by Robert Novak on Capital Gang and repeated in <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/novak/cst-edt-novak20.html">this article</a>.</p>
<p>The closest thing to what Bush seems to be saying was this statement from John Thune on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6030941">Meet The Press</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I think, clearly, we&#8217;ve got to&#8211;there&#8217;s a strategy in place. Obviously, it&#8217;s to, you know, create an interim government, move to free elections, ratify a constitution, train an Iraqi army.  Those steps are being taken.  And, you know, this is going to be a tough job and nobody said otherwise… This is not a time to cut and run.  This is a time to show resolve and the international community is responding. I mean, there is more support building, I believe, for what&#8217;s happening there… Everybody I talked to is totally supportive of what we&#8217;re doing there.  I mean, they believe that they believe in the mission, they believe we&#8217;re making progress.  This is important work that we&#8217;re about… I think the president&#8217;s made it very clear.  Set up an interim government, ratify a constitution, hold free elections, train an Iraqi army. I mean, there are steps being taken.  There is a strategy in place and we need to continue to pursue that strategy and make sure we are successful in prevailing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also there was Senator Jon Kyl on <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/face_091904.pdf">Face The Nation</a></p>
<blockquote><p>He began by pointing out to the American people that this would be a very long and very difficult war and that we were going to have to have the confidence and the perseverance to see it through. I find it shocking that some people are surprised by the fact that it is a long and difficult conflict. So that should not be a surprise. What&#8217;s important is that you have a leader who recognizes that there are difficulties but who is committed to prevailing, who has a firm idea of what he wants to accomplish, confidence in his commanders in the field, and who doesn&#8217;t send mixed messages to the troops or to our allies, most importantly to our enemies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novak says Bush plans to cut and run, Thune and Kyl say stay on course, and only Graham says we need to do more to secure Iraq.  Talk about mixed messages!<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;[T]oday, President Bush tells us that he would do everything all over again, the same way. How can he possibly be serious?&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Is he really saying to Americans that if we had known there were no imminent threat, no weapons of mass destruction, no ties to al-Qaida, the United States should have invaded Iraq? My answer is resoundingly no, because a commander in chief&#8217;s first responsibility is to make a wise and responsible decision to keep America safe.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own special place in hell. But that was not, in itself, a reason to go to war. The satisfaction we take in his downfall does not hide this fact: We have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of more interest might be <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6052073">this</a> report from Reuters. Ivor Roberts, the UK ambassador to Italy, apparently said “If anyone is ready to celebrate the eventual re-election of Bush, it’s al-Qaida…Bush is al-Qaida’s best recruiting sergeant.”<br /></p>

                                <p>National polls of the presidential race have been unusually wide-ranging over recent weeks.  Here is a summary of some of their results: </p>
<p>1. Economist, 9/15: Bush +1<br />
<br />2. Harris, 9/13: Kerry +1<br />
<br />3. ICR, 9/12: Bush +4<br />
<br />4. Pew, 9/14: Kerry +0<br />
<br />5. Rasmussen, 9/16: Bush +4<br />
<br />6. Zogby, 9/9: Bush +2<br />
<br />7. ABC, 9/8: Bush +6<br />
<br />8. CBS, 9/16: Bush +8<br />
<br />9. Fox, 9/8: Bush +2<br />
<br />10. Gallup, 9/14: Bush +8<br />
<br />11. IDB, 9/12: Kerry +2<br />
<br />12. News, 9/10: Bush +6</p>
<p>All of these polls were taken over a roughly one-week period, yet they show an range in results that is far outside of the typical poll&#8217;s margin of error (MoE).  Why?</p>
<p>Chris Bowers at MyDD <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2004/9/18/454/00913">provides a thorough explanation</a> for why polls #1-6 listed above are fundamentally different from polls #7-12, and why the first six are more likely to be accurate.  The explanation is this: the first six polls weight their results by party ID, whereas the last six polls do not.  </p>
<p>For example, if 50% of the poll respondents say that they&#8217;re Republican, then it&#8217;s likely that the aggregate figures will show a big lead for Bush.  But there might be some reason to believe that you haven&#8217;t surveyed a representative sample, if you have other information that leads you to believe that the percent of Republicans in the population is really only 30%.  Polls #1-6 above adjust their results to reflect this prior knowledge of how many Repubs, Dems, and Independents there actually are in the US.  Polls #7-12 do not. </p>
<p>For some reason, several polls have recently had unusually high numbers of respondents self-identify as Republicans &#8212; around 40% of respondents to the Gallup poll were self-identified as Republican, even though nationally Republicans are generally only about 33-35% of the population.  Polls that adjust for this discrepancy show the race nearly tied, while polls that don&#8217;t how a large lead for Bush. This suggests that it may make sense to weight the raw results by party ID.  Earlier this week, Ruy Teixeira at the Emerging Democratic Majority wrote <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000663.php">an excellent summary</a> of that argument.</p>
<p>I am left with a lingering, but possibly crucial question, however.  <em><strong>What accounts for the recent spike in people self-identifying as Republicans?</strong></em>  I&#8217;d like to believe that the race is tied right now (which is what the weighted polls suggest), but if the answer is that some people change their party ID answer depending on which candidate they&#8217;re leaning toward, then it may not make sense to weight the raw data by party ID at all.  It seems to me that answering this crucial question is fundamental to interpreting these widely varying poll results.</p>

                                <p>I was about to fire off a really angry post about Bush’s jokes on the political stump yesterday: something about Kerry having eight positions on Iraq when he should have been talking about how the NIE flat out contradicting his happy talk (shorter version: lies) about the situation in Iraq.  But the email from the Kerry camp caught <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040916-21.html">this</a> from Cheney’s remarks in Reno yesterday:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Senator Kerry said today that leadership starts with telling the truth. But, see &#8212; (Laughter.) That&#8217;s not the laugh line. (Laughter.) The America people also know that true leadership requires the ability to make a decision. True leadership is sticking with the decision in the face of political pressure, and true leadership is standing for your principles regardless of your audience or your most recent political advisors. (Applause.) Senator Kerry today said he would always be straight with the American people on the good days and on the bad days. In Senator Kerry&#8217;s case, that means when the headlines are good, he&#8217;s for the war. And when his poll numbers are bad, he&#8217;s against it. (Laughter.) </p></blockquote>
<p>Unbelievable from an Administration that bases almost every decision on what the political operatives want to do.  But then I guess Dick Cheney thinks both war and integrity are laughing matters.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, Bush was complaining about mixed signals to the insurgents.  Bush has lied to the world about why we invaded Iraq, has undermanned the rebuilding efforts, has lied about the current situation, basically ignored Al Qaeda, and used war for domestic political purposes, and is currently avoided the tough tasks in the Iraq he has messed up.  And he dares to talk about mixed signals?<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Kerry&#8217;s plan to have the government provide reinsurance for health insurance represents a major attempt at addressing the health care problem that the US is currently facing. The heart of the proposal boils down to this: the US government would agree to cover 75% of any employee&#8217;s medical bills that are in excess of $50,000 in one year.  In exchange, firms that want to take advantage of this government insurance program must agree to provide health insurance to all employees.  Would this do anything to reduce the cost of health care in the US?</p>
<p>The Washington Post wrote <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16748-2004Jun4.html">this</a> a couple of months ago about the proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kerry&#8217;s catastrophic-illness relief plan is the only new health care proposal &#8212; and the most expensive &#8212; of this campaign season. It marks the first time in 12 years that a political leader has attempted to reorient the insurance market away from dodging the costliest patients and in the direction of implementing higher quality of care. </p>
<p>The concept of a national reinsurance pool has garnered support from a wide spectrum of players from labor unions and former Vermont governor Howard Dean on the left to former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Bush economic adviser R. Glenn Hubbard on the right.</p></blockquote>
<p>How would this national reinsurance pool help our nation&#8217;s health care problem?  In a couple of ways.  First and most obviously, it would simply reduce the cost to health insurers of providing health insurance, resulting in lower premiums.  Part of this cost would be shifted to taxpayers, but as we shall see, the cost to taxpayers will be less than the savings reaped by people buying health insurance.</p>
<p>Second, the Kerry proposal would dramatically reduce the riskiness of providing health insurance for a small firm, and thus disproportionately reduce the cost of health insurance for small companies.  Why?  Because 20% of all health care costs in the US are generated by just 0.5% of people in the US.  </p>
<p>Think of it this way. Since the claims for one seriously ill person can easily reach $100,000 or more in a year (while most people&#8217;s claims are probably just in the hundreds of dollars), it&#8217;s much harder for an insurance company to predict what the aggregage health care costs will be of a group of 10 people compared to a group of 1,000 people.  The law of large numbers means that you can pretty much rely on population averages when trying to guess how much health care the large group will need over the year; but for the small group, you either have to spend a lot of time and energy evaluating each of the 10 individuals to estimate each one&#8217;s likely health care needs for the coming year, or else you have to just take a chance.  And insurance companies hate just taking chances.</p>
<p>The best estimates that I have seen by an economist of the effects of this reinsurance proposal are those by Kenneth Thorpe, professor at Emory&#8217;s school of public health. <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpm/thorpe/nobugthorpe2.pdf">He estimates</a> that the Kerry plan would reduce the variance of firms&#8217; insurance claims by about 50 percent. This in turn will have two effects.  It means that it will become dramatically cheaper for small firms to provide health insurance to their employees.  Combined with the plan&#8217;s requirement that all participating firms offer health insurance to all employees, Thorpe estimates that about 3 million currently uninsured people will start receiving health insurance. This in turn will help to reduce the country&#8217;s overall health care costs by allowing more preventative care and early detection of health problems.  </p>
<p>In addition, the reinsurance pool will dramatically reduce the incentives that insurance companies&#8217; currently have to spend large amounts of resources identifying potential very high-claim individuals and separating the potential high-claim companies from the low-claim companies.</p>
<p>According to Thorpe, the average small firm would see their health insurance bill fall by about 4% &#8212; <strong><em>even after</em></strong> they extend health insurance coverage to all employees.  Analytically this net savings to the country seems obvious.  Insurance companies are institutions that take on risk from individuals, spend valuable resources to understand exactly how much risk they are facing, and then are paid a premium to absorb that risk.  If the risk they face falls, then the premiums that they can demand will also fall.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Kerry&#8217;s reinsurance plan will result in a net savings to the country as a whole, as less health care resources are spent on late care for the uninsured and on the screening and administration that insurance companies do because of the fear of unknowingly insuring a very high-claim person.  To an economist, this should seem an ideal outcome, because it implies a gain in both equity and efficiency.  Hopefully non-economists would see it that way as well.</p>

                                <p><strong>Postcards from Old Europe &#8211; Tales from the Soft Patch</strong></p>
<p>US policy makers have been adamant about the fact that the economy is in (or coming out of) a transitory soft patch. The comments usually sound something like this:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that the soft patch is mostly behind us. I don&#8217;t see any good reason for the soft patch. I&#8217;m sure high energy prices are a big part of it and I&#8217;m hopeful they will come down even more than they have. I expect the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be better than the second quarter&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote comes from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not at all that sanguine about the outlook for the coming months. Momentum has been bleeding out of all current data releases which leads me to assume that we are still firmly in the boggy midst of the soft patch.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the data. The closely watched manufacturing surveys are all off of the highs seen at the beginning of the year (or even a few months ago). Component indices show capital spending plans are being revised downwards and expectations of future prospects looking less bright.</p>
<p>The OECD leading indicator for the US is looking anemic as well. The most <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/30/0,2340,en_2649_34349_33703646_1_1_1_1,00.html">recent update tells us</a> that<br />
<blockquote>The CLI (composite leading indicator) for the United States increased by 0.1 point in July but its six-month rate of change fell for the seventh month in a row after nine consecutive months of strong increases.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same story hold for the US index of leading indicators as measured by the <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/">Conference Board</a>. The <a href="http://www.globalindicators.org/us/LatestReleases/">latest press release</a> even goes so far as to say<br />
<blockquote>The slower growth of the leading index so far this year is consistent with a moderate rate of real GDP growth in the near term.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comes as no surprise considering the fact that the last couple of years saw an almost unprecedented amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus being thrown at the economy. Most of the tax breaks have worked their way through the system and consumers are now being forced to live off of their stagnating incomes whilst paying for debt incurred in happier times. This fact becomes evident if you look at the behavior of retail sales over the last six months.</p>
<p>In short: I believe that we are still right in the middle of the soft patch &#8211; irrespective what policy makers or candidates say. I&#8217;d say that the next couple of months will see a steady erosion of economic momentum which will then lead us to Q4 GDP rising at around 3%. The picture becomes even more bleak if we assume that the <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/taxmatters/index.cfm?story=20030527">accelerated depreciation allowance for business investment</a> led to investments being pulled forward into this year. What will then happen to capital spending and the economy next year?</p>
<p>If this picture continues to solidify we might see the Fed really start to squirm. Fading growth, no growth in real incomes, no stimulus from exports and prices drifting upwards on the back of higher energy prices. To this scenario I say: get out your bell-bottoms, it&#8217;s the seventies all over again!</p>
