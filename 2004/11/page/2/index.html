                                <p>In last week&#8217;s Sunday NY Times, there&#8217;s a good roundup of economists&#8217; thinking about how to finance prescription drug research, by Eduardo Porter, with the unfortunate title &#8220;<a href="http://www.essentialdrugs.org/edrug/archive/200411/msg00042.php">Do New Drugs Always Have to Cost So Much</a>?&#8221; This kind of article seems to be a specialty of Porter&#8217;s. He&#8217;s really good at finding the right economists to talk to, but weaker when it comes to his own analysis.</p>
<p>On the pro-reform side, Porter interviews certified genius <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/kremer/">Michael Kremer</a>, progressive advocate <a href="http://www.cepr.net/dbbio.htm">Dean Baker</a>, and <a href="http://econ.ucalgary.ca/hollis.htm">Aidan Hollis</a>.  Hollis is an economist from Canada whose work I wasn&#8217;t familiar with.  He seems to take a line somewhat like <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17244">Marcia Angell</a> and Naderites, except that he makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>The gist of Porter&#8217;s article is that we could get cheaper drugs if research were funded through some alternative to patents. The government could provide prizes for innovative drugs, it could buy up patent rights to new drugs and then license the rights cheaply, or it could simply pay for drug development itself. Porter writes that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>some economists say that there is no inexorable economic reason for drug prices to be as high as they are. &#8220;Patents are one way to get medical innovation, but they are not a fact of nature,&#8221; said Michael R. Kremer, an economics professor at Harvard. &#8220;It is worth looking for alternatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with this line of thought is that it draws too strong a connection between the goal of lowering drug prices and reshaping the system for financing innovation. Coming up with alternatives (or better yet complements) to the patent system is a good idea, but its main benefit won&#8217;t be lowering drug prices. The benefit will be more medical innovation: for example discovering new ways to use old drugs; research that private industry won&#8217;t fund because they can&#8217;t make much money from off-patent drugs. The goal of more (and more efficient) medical innovation is the argument that economists Kremer, Hollis, and Baker emphasize (though Baker often decries high drug prices too).</p>
<p>Reform of the system for financing medical research is important and worthwhile (and I plan to discuss it more later in the week on my <a href="http://ragout.blogspot.com/">home blog</a>). But high drug prices simply aren&#8217;t much of a problem in the U.S. (though it&#8217;s a serious problem killing millions in poorer countries). For one thing, the standard economic case for the inefficiency of patents simply doesn&#8217;t apply here.</p>
<p>The usual economic argument is that although patents are needed to subsidize research and development, they have an efficiency cost too. Since patents raise the price of drugs above the cost of production (including &#8220;normal profits&#8221;) fewer people end up buying them than would if they were sold on a competitive market. There&#8217;s a &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; because a lot of the out-of-luck people would have been happy to buy the drugs at the competitive price.</p>
<p>But since prescription drugs are often paid for by insurance, this argument about deadweight loss doesn&#8217;t apply. If anything, people are all too willing to buy expensive drugs, even when they provide little or no additional benefit over cheaper drugs. Americans currently spend about <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/nhe/projections-2003/t2.asp">$200 billion a year</a> on Rx drugs, or about $1,900 per household per year.  And most of it, about 70%, <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/nhe/historical/t3.asp">is covered by some form of insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The average American actually spends more on cable TV than they do out of pocket on prescription drugs. As far as high prices go, I&#8217;d rather see the government tackle the high price of cable TV (which are inflated by unjustified monopoly profits).</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has insurance, and for the people being forced to choose &#8220;<a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/oh10_kucinich/092804fmda.html">between their drugs and food</a> or paying their bills,&#8221; the obvious solution is simply to have the government pay for it, as with the Medicare Rx drug benefit. No doubt the Medicare drug benefit has a lot of flaws, and it won&#8217;t cover younger people. But it sure is a direct way of making prescription drugs more available.  A whole lot more direct than rethinking the whole patent system.</p>

<br /><em><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Just your opinion, do you think that Charles Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution is: a scientific theory that has been well-supported by evidence, just one of many theories and one that has not been well-supported by evidence, or don&#8217;t you know enough about it to say?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p></em>Here are the results:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><em>A scientific theory well-supported by evidence: 35%<br />
<br />Just one of many theories and one that has not been well-supported by evidence: 35%<br />
<br />Don&#8217;t know enough about it to say: 29%</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Answering a different question, a full 45% chose the answer that &#8220;God created humans as they are 10,000 years ago&#8221; over &#8220;Humans developed, but God guided the process&#8221; or &#8220;Humans developed, God had no part.&#8221; This makes me seriously wonder if it can really be true that 45% of Americans would not take their children to one of those most notorious repositories of lies: a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=museum+of+natural+science&#038;start=0&#038;start=0&#038;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=utf-8&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">museum of natural science</a>.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://gadflyer.com/flytrap/index.php?Week=200447#1201">The Gadflyer</a> (for regular updates and critiques on evolution, creationism, and intelligent design, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/">Panda&#8217;s Thumb</a>.)</p>
<p>And if I may venture astray from the regular fare here at Angry Bear, there is one question to which I&#8217;ve long desired a good anwer. The fundamental premise of <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html">Intelligent Design</a> seems to be that complexity is evidence of design, and that design naturally implies a <em>designer</em>, or God. In that, it seems little more than a modern recasting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">Aquinas&#8217; 13th century argument</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It is clear that there are in this world things which are moved. Now, every object which is moved receives that movement from another. If the motor is itself moved, there must be another motor moving it, and after that yet another, and so on. But it is impossible to go on indefinitely, for then there would be no first motor at all, and consequently no movement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not, of course, a real proof: arguing that all design requires a first-designer is circular, for by its own logic, it means the first-designer must in turn have a designer, which must also have a designer, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. Sure, this is an argument many a college student has made or encountered in a coffee shop or late night discussion. But just because it&#8217;s an old and not particularly sophisticated point does not mean it lacks merit, and I&#8217;ve never heard a satisfactory answer to this issue from those who &#8212; like members of the Intelligent Design movement &#8212; posit arguments from complexity for the existence of God.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m a <em>godless liberal</em>, so take this with a grain of salt if you wish, but I&#8217;ve always found Kierkegaard&#8217;s argument in <em><a href="http://home.ddc.net/ygg/etext/fear.htm">Fear and Trembling</a></em> to be the most compelling: the fundamental ingredient of faith is <em>faith itself</em>. If proof of God is either available or required for belief, then that is not <em>faith</em>.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Would it not be better to stop with faith, and is it not revolting that everybody wants to go further? When in our age (as indeed is proclaimed in various ways) they will not stop with love, where then are they going? To earthy wisdom, to petty calculation, to paltriness and wretchedness, to everything which can make man&#8217;s divine origin doubtful. Would it not be better that they should stand still at faith, and that he who stands should take heed lest he fall? For the movements of faith must constantly be made by virtue of the absurd, yet in such a way, be it observed, that one does not lose the finite but gains it every inch &#8230; I make the movements of infinity, whereas faith does the opposite: after having made the movements of infinity, it makes those of finiteness. Hail to him who can make those movements, he performs the marvellous, and I shall never grow tired of admiring him, whether he be Abraham or a slave in Abraham&#8217;s house; whether he be a professor of philosophy or a servant-girl, I look only at the movements. But at them I do look, and do not let myself be fooled, either by myself or by any other man. The knights of the infinite resignation are easily recognized: their gait is gliding and assured. Those on the other hand who carry the jewel of faith are likely to be delusive, because their outward appearance bears a striking resemblance to that which both the infinite resignation and faith profoundly despise … to Philistinism. </p>

                                <p>Jesse Taylor has <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/003996.html">fun</a> with how many times Peggy Noonan wrote “<em>Ssssssssssssshhhhhhh</em>&#8230;.” in this <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110005907">WSJ oped</a>.  OK, I have come to expect WSJ opeds to miss the point but they often try to make a point.  I can’t believe Noonan ever wrote speeches for President Reagan given that this has less substance than a teenage girl’s diary entry after the slumber party.  </p>
<p>But let’s look at her “case” for making Dr. Rice the next Secretary of State.  She’s a “good person” with accomplishments and she’s hard working?  Oh yea –  and she’s black.  Noonan pretends to be fair and balanced noting the possible drawbacks: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush cabinet is getting very Bushian. That sends a clear message. But you don&#8217;t always want to send a clear message. Sometimes you want to confuse things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Followed by something along the line of Dr. Rice not being very feminine.  I have seen lots of very smart people criticizing her nomination with a few things Noonan missed such as:</p>
<p>Rice was a terrible National Security Advisor</p>
<p>Rice is more loyal to the Bush partisan hacks than willing to work for our national interest</p>
<p>Her only expertise seems to be on a former regime, which is now supposed to be a Russian democracy – well at least until this Administration has just allowed Putin to undermine what progress the nation was making in this regard</p>
<p>While we are supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the Arab world, Rice is a Likudnik</p>
<p>Rice has lied many times and not even our allies trust her</p>
<p>But Peggy Noonan does not address the substance.  Pardon for me for saying this but until she can write something of substance, maybe Peggy should take her own advice:</p>
<p><em>Ssssssssssssshhhhhhh</em></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Ann Coulter must think Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution to be racist since it says that the President: </p>
<blockquote><p>shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200411180009">Coulter</a> labeled Democrats as racist for questioning the credentials of Condoleezza Rice.  The Advice and Consent clause has now become a device for “high tech lynching”?  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today Alan Greenspan gave an address to a central bankers&#8217; conference in Frankfurt &#8212; at the end of a week that has seen the dollar plumb new depths of weakness against the euro.  In <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20041119/default.htm">his speech</a> Greenspan reveals his latest thinking about the US&#8217;s external imbalances.</p>
<blockquote><p>The question now confronting us is how large a current account deficit in the United States can be financed before resistance to acquiring new claims against U.S. residents leads to adjustment. Even considering heavy purchases by central banks of U.S. Treasury and agency issues, we see only limited indications that the large U.S. current account deficit is meeting financing resistance. Yet, net claims against residents of the United States cannot continue to increase forever in international portfolios at their recent pace. Net debt service cost, though currently still modest, would eventually become burdensome. At some point, diversification considerations will slow and possibly limit the desire of investors to add dollar claims to their portfolios.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Greenspan argues that the factor that will end the seemingly infinite appetite for US dollar securities around the world is the desire of foreign investors to diversify their portfolios.  This seems a peculiar supposition, since most of the demand seems to be coming from central banks, not individuals, and it is well-known that central banks have very different objectives from individuals.  In particular, Japan&#8217;s central bank (the Bank of Japan, or BoJ) almost certainly cares a lot more about keeping the dollar above some critical level against the yen than it cares about being properly diversified.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates how closely the BoJ&#8217;s purchases of dollar-denominated assets are related to the yen/dollar exchange rate.  The chart shows monthly net purchases of foreign currency reserves by the Japanese central bank since the middle of 2003, with the yen/dollar exchange rate superimposed.  As I&#8217;ve pointed out before, the BoJ seems to have drawn a line in the sand at right around 105 ¥/$, below which it won&#8217;t allow the exchange rate to fall, for reasons having to do with the balance sheets of Japanese firms.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/yen_intervention2.jpg"></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have data on BoJ purchases of dollars for October or November yet, but the pattern still seems quite clear: whenever the exchange rate starts moving down toward 105, the BoJ buys dollars, and whenever it starts rising away from 105 it stops buying them.  So I just don&#8217;t buy Greenspan&#8217;s suggestion that portfolio diversification considerations are going to bring this pattern to an end.</p>
<p>I do agree, however, with the obvious point that Greenspan made in his speech that nothing lasts forever, including Asian central banks&#8217; demand for US dollar assets:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems persuasive that, given the size of the U.S. current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point. But when, through what channels, and from what level of the dollar? Regrettably, no answer to those questions is convincing.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we don&#8217;t know why foreign appetite for US securities will diminish, but we can agree that it will.  So what can be done about the problem?  Greenspan&#8217;s answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. policy initiatives can reinforce other factors in the global economy and marketplace that foster external adjustment. Policy success, of course, requires that domestic saving must rise relative to domestic investment. </p>
<p>&#8230;Reducing the federal budget deficit (or preferably moving it to surplus) appears to be the most effective action that could be taken to augment domestic saving. Significantly increasing private saving in the United States&#8211;more particularly, finding policies that would elevate the personal saving rate from its current extraordinarily low level&#8211;of course would also be helpful. Corporate saving in the United States has risen to its highest rate in decades and is unlikely to increase materially. Alternative approaches to reducing our current account imbalance by reducing domestic investment or inducing recession to suppress consumption obviously are not constructive long-term solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm.  So it seems that, unless we can balance the federal budget (which, given our current president and Congress, is about as likely as my swimming across the Atlantic) there is no good policy solution to the problem.  Luckily, Greenspan tells us that it doesn&#8217;t matter; even if none of these remedies does the trick, the &#8220;flexibility&#8221; of the US economy will magically make everything turn out okay anyway:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is of course possible that U.S. policy initiatives directed at closing the gap between our domestic investment and domestic saving, and hence narrowing our current account deficit, may not suffice. But should such initiatives fall short, the marked increase in the economic flexibility of the American economy that has developed in recent years suggests that market forces should over time restore, without crises, a sustainable U.S. balance of payments.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, we don&#8217;t exactly know <em><strong>how</strong></em> the US economy&#8217;s &#8220;flexibility&#8221; will make everything okay&#8230; but don&#8217;t worry.  Everything will still be just fine.</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: I&#8217;ve fixed the error in the graph to reflect the fact that it measures purchases of all reserve assets by the BoJ, not just US Treasuries.</p>

                                <p>A story in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58554-2004Nov17.html">Washington Post</a> discusses some of the possible tax changes that seem to be most likely in whatever &#8220;tax reform&#8221; package that Bush proposes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he administration plans to push major amendments that would shield interest, dividends and capitals gains from taxation, expand tax breaks for business investment and take other steps intended to simplify the system and encourage economic growth, according to several people who are advising the White House or are familiar with the deliberations. </p>
<p>The changes are meant to be revenue-neutral. To pay for them, the administration is considering eliminating the deduction of state and local taxes on federal income tax returns and scrapping the business tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance, the advisers said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite Bush&#8217;s claims that he will not raise taxes on anyone, such changes would of course raise taxes on many people.  Specifically, taxes would go up for those who live in high-tax states and localities and who earn most of their income in the form of wages. (Yes, we all know where those people live.) Taxes would go down for those who earn income from capital.  And businesses would lose their principle incentive for providing health insurance.  Sounds about as I would have expected.</p>

                                <p>So here&#8217;s a question for you: how many times will the Bush administration have to ask Congress to increase the government&#8217;s debt ceiling?  This week&#8217;s action makes #3 so far, but the new limit of over $8 trillion will probably be reached in less than two years.  So it will at least be four, and probably five times that Bush will have to ask for an <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;cid=512&#038;ncid=1278&#038;e=2&#038;u=/ap/20041118/ap_on_go_co/congress_spending_debt">increase in his credit limit</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Congress is ready to send President Bush an $800 billion debt limit increase, a testament to the massive federal deficits that have marked his administration. </p>
<p>With no alternative but an unprecedented federal default, the House planned to vote Thursday to boost the debt ceiling from its current $7.38 trillion level, following Senate passage Wednesday. </p>
<p>&#8230;Not a single Republican spoke during debate on the debt limit bill, reflecting how politically uncomfortable the measure is for them. That discomfort was highlighted when they refused to bring the bill to a vote before the elections. </p>
<p>Completion of the debt limit measure would raise the government&#8217;s borrowing limit to $8.18 trillion. That is $2.23 trillion higher than when Bush became president in 2001, and more than eight times the debt President Reagan faced when he took office in 1981.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; While pledging to help President Bush promote anti-abortion judges to the federal bench, Sen. Arlen Specter is struggling to maintain his proudly cultivated image as an independent thinker and sometime maverick.</p>
<p>&#8230;A flash of his rebellious side surfaced this week when Specter, just after pleading his case to Senate Republicans, snapped one word — &#8220;Yes&#8221; — when asked if he will be able to maintain his independence. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that he has had to concede any of his positions,&#8221; said fellow moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, noting that Specter has so far supported all of Bush&#8217;s nominees. </p>
<p>&#8220;He obviously hasn&#8217;t changed his position with respect to the Roe v. Wade decision, and the way in which he views judges. I mean, it&#8217;s not a departure from the past in terms of what he intends to do in the future as the potential chair of the Judiciary Committee.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Senator Snowe.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re right that Specter will not hesitate to express his own opinion about judicial nominees.  And socially liberal Republicans still have some influence over the party.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;it is interesting to discover, according to a new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that governments of the left in Europe have been doing pretty much the same thing as President Bush has done here&#8230;there have been a number of major tax cuts in Europe that have lowered taxes as a share of the gross domestic product by 1 percent, from 39.9 percent in 2000 to 38.9 percent in 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that total U.S. taxes – even if one includes Social Security contributions – are less than 30%, I am more struck by how high Europe’s tax share is relative to ours. Then again, our reporting of taxes is misleading as it fails to account for the massive amount of deferred taxation from the Bush Administration’s pretending to give us our money back and they increase government spending.  Normally, Mr. Bartlett is quite good for pointing this out.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>Think about it. You&#8217;ve paid taxes. It was complicated. But did the existence of different tax brackets significantly contribute to the complexity? Of course not. What&#8217;s complicated is calculating your income (especially if you, like me, derive income from several different sources) and calculating which deductions and tax credits you&#8217;re entitled to claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now remember that the Steve Forbes version of the flat tax would not tax certain kinds of capital income at all.  Matthew is much better at explaining tax policy than Mr. Forbes!<br /></p>
