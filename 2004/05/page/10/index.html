                                <p><strong>Postcards from Old Europe &#8211; Consume your house!</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: due to extensive traveling without access to the web this postcard is a day early. </em></p>
<p>As the past columns have been very Euro-centric I guess that it is high time to shift my view back to the goings-on in the US. While household demand has been flagging in Europe the US consumer has been a bastion of strength over the past couple of years. This is pretty astounding if you consider that the most recent past has seen a stock market crash and rising unemployment. One would think that these negatives would have led many households to retrench and start to consolidate their personal finances. This didn&#8217;t happen. Consumers kept their wallets open &#8211; the only question is: &#8220;where did the money come from?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at the numbers to set the stage: Household wealth saw massive equity-driven gains up to the year 2000. Holdings of equities and mutual funds peaked in 2000 at around 12 trillion dollars and then fell by around 25% before making a come-back over past couple of months. The year 2000 is also significant because it saw equity wealth overtake real estate wealth for the first time. The subsequent reduction in value of stocks (i.e. bubble-bursting) served to push houses back on top of the household wealth heap by 2001.</p>
<p>In the years after 2000 US households saw two things: their stocks were racing for the bottom while the value of their homes started taking off. This rise in real estate wealth took some of the sting out of looking at the diminishing value of the investment portfolio. For many families rising house-prices meant rising household wealth &#8211; even after taking into account the losses in other investments.</p>
<p>But while a single call to your broker will release the gains (losses) in your trading account selling a home isn&#8217;t that easy. But wait, why sell? The financial service industry provides you with a host of possibilities to release all that equity locked up in your home! But that&#8217;s not all &#8211; there&#8217;s more! You can even deduct interest paid on home equity lines of credit (and mortgages) from income for tax purposes! </p>
<p>Let us take a step back here and look at what used to happen: a family would identify a home it wanted to buy and then make a down payment and finance the balance. The next couple of years would see the equity in the home increase primarily by the act of the family paying down the debt. If the family was lucky they would see interest rates fall which would then lead them to refinance their mortgage, thereby saving money. If the family was really lucky they would also see the price of their home rise.</p>
<p>This is what has been happening on a massive scale over the past couple of years. Rates have been falling while prices have been shooting upwards. This confluence of positive forces ignited a rocket in home equity which consumers have been riding hard. </p>
<p>A look at the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/Z1/">Fed&#8217;s Flow of Funds reports</a> gets us the data. The carving out of home equity can be calculated by subtracting the growth in residential investment from the growth in mortgage debt. The amount of equity extraction has been staggering over the past two years! The past has only rarely seen phases of equity extraction at all! The last 20 years were characterized by homeowners paying down debt &#8211; i.e. investing equity!</p>
<p>Equity extraction peaked in the middle of 2003 at a time where the FOMC saw deflation just around the corner and interest rates on mortgages were at near-record low levels. These equity take outs boosted consumer disposable incomes by up to 3% &#8211; at a time when wages and salaries remained mostly flat. No wonder that the growth in consumption managed to outstrip the growth in &#8220;real&#8221; income.</p>
<p>But real income via wages is coming firmly back into focus. Interest rates are creeping up and most everyone who has wanted to refinance has refinanced by now. Momentum in existing home sales is moderating as record-high prices will probably see affordability drop and turnover moderate. Any slowdown in home equity extraction could lead to less consumption if disposable income doesn&#8217;t get a boost via rising wages or from other sources. The <a href="http://curryblog.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_curryblog_archive.html#108237561091014836">missing tax refunds</a> are not helping either!</p>
<p>To sum it up: consumers have been spending all through the recession and the following phase of economic weakness. As wages and salaries have been flat while the stock market has been sputtering, consumers have tapped into home equity to sustain their spending binge. As this possibility is becoming less attractive, consumers need other sources of income to compensate. Just one more reason why everyone is so focused on the payroll data.</p>
<p>Just a thought to finish off with: what happens if house prices fall?</p>

                                <p>Stupid Liberal Media</p>
<p>Well, the media actually aren&#8217;t liberal. But there&#8217;s a good case to be made for stupidity. The latest comes via <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5637-2004May5.html">today&#8217;s Washington Post</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Registered lobbyists gave President Bush $1.8 million and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) $520,000 in campaign contributions <strong>from Jan. 1, 1997, through March 31 this year</strong>, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity.</p>
<p>The amounts, while impressive in absolute terms, are tiny compared with total donations received by the politicians. Bush collected $228.4 million and Kerry took in $36.9 million over the period from people who gave $200 or more, additional numbers supplied by the nonpartisan research group show. Total contributions are higher but <strong>the campaigns are not required to disclose the names of people who give less than $200</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the period, 1,310 registered lobbyists contributed to Bush and 442 registered lobbyists gave money to Kerry, the center said. These numbers, too, are small compared with the total number of donors to both men. Bush had 156,989 contributors who gave $200 or more and Kerry had 30,223 individuals who gave similar amounts, according to the center.</p>
<p><strong>Proportionately, Kerry had more lobbyist donors than Bush did. Registered lobbyists represented 0.8 percent of Bush&#8217;s donors and of his itemized contributions, compared with 1.4 percent of Kerry&#8217;s through March 31</strong>. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s spot the logical flaws in this analysis:
<ul>
<li>The reporter (who gets his data from the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/default.aspx">Center for Public Integrity</a>, though I can&#8217;t find the exact report there) uses the time period from 1/1/1997 to 3/31/2004 to compare the two candidates&#8217; contributions from lobbyists. Given that for half of those years Kerry was a senator while Bush was a governor, this surely distorts the comparison, and most likely in a way unfavorable to Kerry. Particularly if the data only come from the <em>Federal </em>Election Commission then this statistic compares 7 years of Kerry&#8217;s funding to 4 years of Bush&#8217;s. Unfortunately, the article doesn&#8217;t explain exactly what&#8217;s being compared. But it&#8217;s assuredly not apples-to-apples. If the objective is to describe how beholden each candidate is to lobbyists, then the meaningful statistic is contributions from lobbyists in the current election cycle. </p>
</li>
<li>The reporter&#8217;s claim that &#8220;Proportionately, Kerry had more lobbyist donors than Bush did&#8221; is also very suspect.  The reporter first says that he&#8217;s only looking at contributions of $200 or more and then claims that, since 1997, 1.4% of Kerry&#8217;s funding is from lobbyists while only 0.8% of Bush&#8217;s is. This comparison is specious because Kerry draws more from small donors than Bush. <a href="http://www.cfinst.org/pr/042204.html">From the Campaign Finance Instutute</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230; with less than five months of fundraising left in the pre-convention period, Bush had raised 71% of his $182 million primary period total in $1,000 and over donations (57% from $2000 contributions) and <strong>20% in small donations</strong>. Kerry, less than four months from the Democratic convention, had raised 54% of his $75 million total in $1,000 and over contributions (32% from $2000 donations) and <strong>29% in small donations</strong> </p></blockquote>
<p>Adjusting total funds for the differences in excluded small donations, about 0.64% of Bush&#8217;s funding and 1% of Kerry&#8217;s are from lobbyists, which is a noticeably smaller gap.  (When I started this post, I suspected this adjustment would wipe out all or most of Kerry&#8217;s lead in fundraising from lobbyists. Funny how data work out sometimes. I suppose I could have <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000776.html">followed the lead</a> set by AEI&#8217;s Kevin Hasset.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The long and short of this is that if a reporter (1) Ignores a big chunk of Kerrry&#8217;s donations and (2) Compares time periods which no sane analyst would consider comparable, then he can contend that &#8220;the results are surprising given Kerry&#8217;s criticism of Bush for being close to corporate lobbyists.&#8221;</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>P.S. I can&#8217;t figure out why the CPI, and by extension the <em>Washington Post </em>reporter,  only look at $200+ contributions when the full data are available. For example, a <a href="http://www.fundrace.org/neighbors.php?type=loc&#038;addr=&#038;zip=20008&#038;search=Search+by+Location&#038;off=1100">quick check of fundrace.org</a> for the Cleveland Park area of Washignton, DC shows all contributions, including those under $200. </p>

                                <p><strong>Plenty of Blame to Go Around</strong></p>
<p>Day by day, the scope of the prisoner abuse crimes grows.  The number of prisoners suspected of being murdered by US guards and interrogators has <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/ap/20040505/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_">now risen to 14</a>.  President Bush <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/nm/20040505/pl_nm/iraq_dc&#038;cid=615&#038;ncid=2100">pled his case</a> on a pair of Arab news channels today, Al-Arabiya and the new US-funded channel Al-Hurra.  (Al-Jazeera was not granted an interview &#8211; apparently the Bush administration would like to reduce A-J&#8217;s market share in any way that they can, even at the cost of getting their message out to fewer people in the Arab world.)</p>
<p>The Washington Post today <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2372-2004May4.html">wrote in an editorial</a> that the crimes were the result of certain institutional failures.  The Post specifically cites Rumsfeld&#8217;s decision two years ago to institute &#8220;a system of holding detainees from Afghanistan not only incommunicado, without charge, and without legal process, but without any meaningful oversight mechanism at all,&#8221; in addition to the fact that Congress has &#8220;neglected its responsibility to oversee the administration&#8217;s conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I suspect that the source of the failure is far deeper.  One of the Bush administration&#8217;s guiding principles since entering office has been that international rules and norms do not apply to the US.  (Just think about the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,168701,00.html">Kyoto Protocol</a>, treaties governing <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/171065_nuclear29.html">nuclear proliferation</a>, and the <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/icc/usindex.htm">International Criminal Court at the Hague</a>, for examples.) The Bush administration has taken the following lesson from the fact that the US is the world’s lone remaining superpower: since no one in the world has the military or economic leverage that the US does, the US has no reason to heed the opinions of the rest of the world.  The attitude conveyed by Bush has been that the US is accountable to no one.  In other words, the US has the ability to be a bully among nations, and under the leadership of George Bush has in fact acted like one in many situations.</p>
<p>This zeitgeist, this sense that it’s okay for the US to use its overwhelming might to do what it wants without fearing the consequences, has percolated down through the pay scale of the government, and probably throughout the nation in general to some degree.  The soldiers in the prison of Abu Ghraib were thus simply putting into practice the Bush administration’s doctrine of bullying the rest of the world, albeit on a very small scale.  But it was the exact same doctrine.  Responsibility for the crimes at Abu Ghraib thus lie squarely at the feet of the man who sets the tone of the US’s international dealings – George Bush.</p>

                                <p><strong>Bond Yields</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of the Fed’s meeting and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/business/05fed.html">press release yesterday</a>, it’s time to check in with the bond market.  The Fed’s announcement apparently came as no major surprise to the bond market, for yields changed very little.  But over the past six weeks we’ve seen quite a major increase in long-term interest rates:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/bond1.gif"><br />(Note: yield expressed in tenths of a percentage point, so 45 = 4.5%)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the increase in yields recently primarily reflects an increase in inflation expectations, not an increase in real interest rates.  One can see this by comparing the yields on inflation adjusted bonds and regular, non-inflation adjusted bonds.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/bond_infl_adj1.jpg"></p>
<p>Expectations of inflation have increased steadily over the past 18 months, but the real (i.e. inflation adjusted) interest rate has not risen at all &#8212; in fact, it&#8217;s actually fallen a bit.  What does this mean?  One possible explanation is that the bond market doesn’t expect the demand for borrowing in the economy to increase much from current levels.  Given that the bond market has learned a lot about the future course of government borrowing during the past 18 months, the fact that they expect overall borrowing in the US to remain roughly constant may imply an expectation that private sector borrowing will not increase much.  Could this be a sign that the bond market isn’t expecting much of an economic boom over the next few years?</p>

                                <p>Is Rush Limbaugh <em>Evil</em>?</p>
<p>If you asked me on Friday I would have said &#8220;No, he&#8217;s not really evil. More of an opportunistic loud-mouth junkie with a talent for fooling and entertaining the dim-witted and foolhardy.&#8221; Digby, in a <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2004_05_02_digbysblog_archive.html#108361185794997601">lengthy post that you should read</a> all the way to the final paragraph&#8217;s evoking of images from the dramatic &#8220;I&#8217;m a nerd, too!&#8221; end to the first <em>Revenge of The Nerds</em> movie, goes a long way towards changing my mind. </p>
<p>In related news, Digby draws his source material from <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200405020008">Media Matters for America</a>, a new site run by David Brock and &#8220;dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.&#8221; Brock, for those who did not read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400047285/ref%3Dase%5Fangrybear-20/103-8120115-9151830">Blinded by The Right</a>, Brock was a former right-wing hit man who orchestrated the attacks on Anita Hill and was also behind many of the efforts to find people in Arkansas who would say bad things about Bill Clinton (in exchange for money and/or fame, of course.) Brock has since converted to the side of light and reason, but he has the history to know that of which he speaks when it comes to &#8220;conservative misinformation.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Speaking of Buffet</p>
<p>Berkshire-Hathaway&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting was held last weekend. Buffet invariably has a great line on any topic, and it looks like his <strike>designated successor</strike> right-hand man, Charlie Munger, is pretty good too. Here&#8217;s Warren and Charlie <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/03/pf/buffett_qanda/">on expensing stock options</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>On stock options<br />
<br /></strong><br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230; Write your congresspeople giving them your views on whether options should be expensed,&#8221; said Buffett. &#8220;It was a disgrace 10 years ago when Congress bludgeoned the SEC and the [Financial] Accounting Standards Board to override FASB&#8217;s decision to expense options. It accelerated the anything-goes mentality of the 1990s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buffett then told the crowd a story about a 19th-century bill in the state of Indiana that sought to &#8220;change&#8221; the value of pi.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems there was a fellow who discovered some new relationship between circumference and diameter that would help students learn a better kind of geometry, so he wrote a law to change the value of pi from 3.14159 etc. to 3.20. It passed the Indiana house &#8212; until the Indiana senate finally thought better of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the audience stopped laughing, Buffett came to his point about options, &#8220;The U.S. Senate concluded that the world was flat, because their their contributors paid them enough to say the world was flat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Munger weighed in: &#8220;It&#8217;s worse than that. Those people who wanted to round pi to 3.2 were stupid. These people [the opponents of expensing options] are worse than stupid. They know it&#8217;s wrong and want to do it anyway.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Another good line arose in their discussion of CEO pay when Munger quipped, &#8220;I would rather throw a viper down my shirtfront than hire a compensation consultant&#8221; (compensation consultants are usually hired by the CEO and their prospects of being rehired in the future often depends in no small part on how much they recommend the CEO be paid.)</p>

                                <p><strong>Some Remarkable Statistics on China</strong></p>
<p>In today’s piece, <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/latest-digest.html">Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley</a> presents some amazing statistics on China’s economy.  Here’s a sampling: </p>
<blockquote><p>In March 2004, [China&#8217;s] growth of industrial value added had surged to an astonishing 19.4% above its year-earlier level.</p>
<p>&#8230;[O]ur calculations suggest that China’s increase in industrial output in 2003 was about eight times as large as that of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8230;China’s leadership is most focused on bringing the nation’s runaway investment cycle back under control; growth in fixed asset investment spiked at an outsize 43% YoY rate in the first quarter of 2004.  </p>
<p>&#8230;While [China] accounts for only about 4% of nominal GDP, in 2003 its portion of the world’s total materials consumption ballooned: For crude oil, it hit 7%; for aluminum it was 25%; for steel products, it was 27%; for iron ore, it was 30%; for coal, it was 31%; and for global cement consumption, China’ s 2003 share hit an astonishing 40%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roach makes the point that when China’s economy slows (something that the government is currently trying to gently engineer), there will be repercussions far beyond China’s borders.  Such statistics provide some compelling evidence that he will be right.  </p>
<p>They also provide a pretty good argument for a Chinese revaluation later this year.  I had been thinking that the revaluation would happen very late this year or, more likely, in 2005; I’m increasingly wondering if the revaluation can wait that long.  The Chinese government may use it earlier than that, as an extremely effective way to curb inflation (especially in imported commodities) and to slow what I would describe as utterly manic business investment.</p>

<p>Buffet did advise Shwarzenegger as well, but I won&#8217;t hold that against him. Maybe he&#8217;ll address it in his next <a href="http://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html">shareholder&#8217;s letter.</a></p>

                                <p>The Abu Ghraib Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma</p>
<p>Phil Carter&#8217;s <a href="http://philcarter.blogspot.com/">Intel Dump</a> is the place to go for real-time analysis of military issues, from a former Army officer. Reading Phil&#8217;s thoughts on the Abu Ghraib situation, I was struck by <a href="http://philcarter.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_philcarter_archive.html#108341589798829542">this passage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s worse is that other American soldiers may suffer for the brutal excesses of these MPs, interrogators, and OGA (&#8220;other government agency&#8221; = CIA) employees. Reciprocity is a very real thing where the laws of wars are concerned, and we should be very concerned about retaliation against any Americans captured by Iraqi insurgents in the future. Similarly, reprisals are very real problem in war; they&#8217;re often fueled by anger over mistreatment of one side&#8217;s own troops.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carter is describing a classic <i>Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma</i>: a situation in which, when two opposing parties pursue actions in their own best interest, the outcome for each is worse than if they had instead cooperated. Such instances are called prisoner&#8217;s dilemmas because the canonical example is two prisoners being interrogated in separate rooms. Each suspects the other will confess and so confesses in order to receive a lighter sentence, even though they would both be better off had neither confessed. Attempting to maximize short-run gain results in each party being worse off than if they had followed a cooperative strategy.</p>
<p>If, however, the game is repeated indefinitely, the outcome can change. In repeated interactions, one player can reward cooperation by the other player by cooperating tomorrow. A common outcome involves tit-for-tat strategies: each side pursues the cooperative action; if, however, one side should fail to live up to its side of the deal by taking an opportunistic action, then the other side will respond by also taking the opportunistic action in the next period. </p>
<p>One of the more classic examples of a repeated Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma is in John Axelrod&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465021212/qid=1083563462">The Evolution of Cooperation</a>. There, Axelrod (*) examines accounts of trench warfare in World War I, noting how on a day to day basis, the opposing troops pursued a cooperative strategy that basically entailed not shooting every enemy soldier they could:<br />
<br />
<blockquote> A fascinating case of the development of cooperation based on continuing interaction occurred in the trench warfare of World War I. In the midst of this very brutal war there developed between the men facing each other what came to be called the &#8220;live and let live system.&#8221; The troops would attack each other when ordered to do so, but between large battles each side would deliberately avoid doing much harm to the other side &#8212; provided tthat thte other side reciprocated (p. 61).</p>
<p>&#8230; the historical situation in the quiet sectors along the Western Front was an iterated Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma. In a given locality, the two players can be taken to be the small units facing each other. At any time, the choices are to shoot to kill or deliberately to shoot to avoid causing damage. For both sides, weakening the enemy is an important value because it will promote survival if a major battle is ordered in the sector. Therefore, in the short run  it is better to do damage now whether the enemy is shooting back or not &#8230; mutual defection is preferred to unilateral restraint [and] unilateral restraint by the other side is  even better than mutual cooperation. In addition, the reward for mutual restraint is preferred by the local units to the outcome of mutual punishment, since mutual punishment would imply that both units would suffer for little or no relative gain (p. 75).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, there is a long history supporting Carter&#8217;s claim that &#8220;reciprocity is a very real thing where the laws of wars are concerned&#8221; and we should, therefore, be very concerned about reprisals against captured Americans. Each side can realize some gain by torturing its captives (e.g., intelligence and propaganda); the cost of doing so is that their respective troops are more likely to be tortured in the future. When either side do so, it gains some strategic advantage (we assume &#8212; otherwise they would not use torture), but over the long run, there is little <i>relative</i> strategic advantage when both sides employ extreme measures. </p>
<p>For example, just today, we received the good news that Halliburton truck driver <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2546010">Tommy Hamill escaped</a> after three weeks in captivity near Baghdad. Part of the reason Hamill was able to escape is that he had not been beaten, tortured, and chained. The likelihood of such restraint in the future is now, sadly, less than it was before Iraqis learned of the abuse at Abu Ghraib.</p>
<p>A paradoxical aspect of this situation is that to avoid the outcome in which both sides use torture, it must be the case that both sides are in fact <i>willing</i> to resort to torture or other vicious measures. Otherwise, the threat to punish the other side tomorrow for resorting to torture today is empty. Returning to the trench analogy, if the Germans never retaliated then the Americans would have no incentive not to shoot. It was the proven willingness of the Germans to strike back that rendered such striking back unnecessary, and vice-versa. </p>
<p>A second implication is that, in order to sustain the &#8220;cooperative&#8221; outcome in which torture is not used by either side, each side must also be willing to <em>not </em>use torture even when there are short-run benefits to doing so. Both sides have demonstrated their willingness and ability to break the cooperative, reciprocal, tacit agreement (see Fallujah and Abu Ghraib, respectively.) An open issue is whether the situation will spiral into a descending series of reprisals and counter-reprisals or whether reciprocity will emerge.</p>
