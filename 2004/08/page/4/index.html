                                <p>While President Bush has asked that these lies be removed from television ads, his words are insufficient.  Asked  specifically whether the ads by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth should be stopped, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of them. That means that ad, every other ad. Absolutely. I can&#8217;t be more plain about it. I hope my opponent joins me in condemning these activities of the 527s. I think they&#8217;re bad for the system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, he could have been more plain.  He could have specifically denounced these lies.  But he did not.  Then again, his surrogate Bob Dole went pathetic on CNN yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>And here&#8217;s, you know, a good guy, a good friend. I respect his record. But three Purple Hearts and never bled that I know of. I mean, they&#8217;re all superficial wounds. Three Purple Hearts and you&#8217;re out.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>For some reason, this letter to the editor from Vietnam veteran Jim Russell is <a href="http://www.telluridegateway.com/articles/2004/08/20/news/opinion/opinion01.txt">in the Telluride Daily Planet</a> instead of the New York Times and Washington Post. Nevertheless it&#8217;s a must read:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; Three things that are forever pictured in my mind since that day over 30 years ago are: (1) The No. 3, 50-foot long, Swift boat getting huge, huge air; John Kerry thought it was about two feet. (He was farther away from it than I). I think it was at least four feet and probably closer to six feet; (2) All the boats turning left and letting loose at the same time like a deadly, choreographed dance and; (3) A few minutes later, John Kerry bending over his boat picking up one of the rangers that we were ferrying from out of the water. All the time we were taking small arms fire from the beach; although because of our fusillade into the jungle, I don&#8217;t think it was very accurate, thank God. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t think that we were being fired upon must have been on a different river.</p>
<p>The picture I have in my mind of Kerry bending over from his boat picking some hapless guy out of the river while all hell was breaking loose around us, is a picture based on fact and it cannot be disputed or changed. It&#8217;s a piece of history drawn in my mind that cannot be redrawn. Sorry, &#8220;Swift Boats Veterans for the Truth&#8221;- that is the truth.</p>

<p>You see, Jim Russel was actually there. And now, back to my vacation.</p>

                                <p>I got this title listening to George Will spin and Paul Krugman correcting the spin on ABC’s <em>This W</em>eek.  Will excuses the weak economy by saying voters care not about the state of the economy but its current direction saying recent real GDP growth has been strong.  Never mind that Bush himself has said he’s for sustained growth.  Will knows that the average annual growth rate will likely be only 2.5% per year for the Bush years as compared to 3.7% for the Clinton years.</p>
<p>But then Dr. Krugman notes that the growth over the past year has been less than the growth from mid-1999 to mid-2000.  While real GDP in 2004QII was 4.77% higher than it was in 2003QII, real GDP in 2000QII was 4.85% higher than it was in 1999QII.  So the line “fastest growth in 20 years” is not true, but I guess “fastest growth since Bush took office” will not play very well.<br /></p>

                                <p>On the morning talk shows, one GOP member after another was asked about President Bush’s refusal to honor the request of John McCain in regards the Swiftie ads.  Over and over, they wanted to change subject and claim Kerry had no plans regarding the Iraq mess.  When reminded that Kerry has made statements as to how we can get out and still maintain an Iraq democracy, the claim was his plans were not specific enough.  So when reminded of the Swift issue, over and over, we hear that the President was opposed the section 527 groups in general.  </p>
<p>Let we forget, here is what McCain has called for: “But I think the Bush campaign should specifically condemn the ad.&#8221;  What part of the word “specifically” do they not understand?<br /></p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The NY Times&#8217; Eduardo Porter asks a bunch of economists about <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/Stories/0,1413,200~20950~2350268,00.html">the impact of the oil price shock on the economy</a>. The bottom line turns out to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Undoubtedly, the recent price surge will hurt. </p></blockquote>
<p>But maybe not that much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most economists have only shaved their growth forecasts slightly. The 30 analysts polled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reduced their forecast for growth in the second half of the year to 3.8 percent from 4.1 percent, and they sliced their growth forecast for 2005 by 0.2 of a percentage point &#8212; to 3.7 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>Porter mostly quotes economic forecasters working for investment banks and such, but also talks to the right academic economist, James Hamilton. Hamilton is mainly known for his highly technical work in time series econometrics, but also happens to do a lot of more applied work on oil prices. He agrees that the oil price shock is bad but not that bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>The price is high enough now that it can reduce the growth rate of the economy&#8230;But I&#8217;m not predicting a recession. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hamilton has a <a href="http://econ.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/#oilshocks">nice web page</a> devoted to his research on oil shocks, which includes a one-page summary of his <a href="http://econ.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/Oil_Aug04.htm">current predictions</a>.</p>
<p>Given all these pretty clear forecasts, it&#8217;s more than a little strange that the article is headlined, &#8220;An Oil Price Shock That Could Be an Economic Stimulus in Disguise.&#8221; Huh? How can something that slows the economy be an economic stimulus?</p>
<p>As best I can make out, the problem seems to be that the financial sector economists are focused on the very short term. And the recent news is not so much the oil rise, as it is changes in investors&#8217; expectations. &#8220;Investors have concluded that higher energy costs are likely to slow the Fed&#8217;s hand in raising interest rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is all well and good if you want to know what&#8217;s going to happen to the stock market next week. But if you want to know what&#8217;s going to happen to the economy in the next year, the answer is that the oil price shock will modestly slow economic growth, but not by enough to start a new recession, and that the effects will be somewhat offset by the Fed.</p>

                                <p>Stephen Moore and Phil Kerpen want the readers of today’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/moore/moore200408191201.asp">National Review</a> to believe that the well to do are paying a lower effective tax rate only because their incomes fell:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the Left continues to work as best it can around these facts. The Kerry-Edwards campaign is now touting a new study by the Congressional Budget Office which purportedly finds that last year’s tax cut was tilted to the rich. There’s just one problem with this class-warfare whine: It just isn’t true. What the CBO report did conclude was that the total tax share by the richest 1 percent declined modestly from 2001 to 2004. But that wasn’t because of the tax cut. It was because of the recession. When the economy contracts and incomes fall as they did in 2001 and 2002, tax payments by the wealthy fall the fastest. This is because of the progressive rate structure of the income tax. In other words, if everyone’s income falls by 10 percent, the overall percentage of taxes paid by the wealthy falls, because they pay a higher marginal tax rate…From 2001 to 2004 incomes have fallen sharply for the highest income groups. IRS data shows that in 2002, taxable income fell by about 4.3 percent, with declines steepest among the highest income groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>We did have a mild recession in 2001 followed by a tepid recovery in 2002.  But Moore and Kerpen do not reconcile their assertion that the rich has suffered sharp income declines with the fact that the share of income going towards the higher income groups has increased.  </p>
<p>But it is easy to spot how Moore-Kerpen distorted the facts: “taxable income fell”.  So if my income that escapes taxation goes up, I’m worse off?  </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Two possible omissions in my statement.  One is the possibility that stock losses may lead to a reduction in taxable income even as income as reported in the GDP accounts rose.  But more importantly, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/001388.html">Brad DeLong </a> notes that Moore-Kerpen failed to read the last sentence of the first paragraph of the CBO report “This analysis of effective federal tax rates from 2002 through 2014 uses data on incomes in 2001, the most recent year for which information is available.”</p>
<p>Kosh notes an oped from Robert Robb who did note that CBO used projected income.  So did Robert Novak, but check out <a href="http://www.maxspeak.org/mt">MaxSpeak’s</a><br />
<br />August 19 take on Mr. Novak’s comment.  </p>

If you scan them, you&#8217;d think that the high price of the black stuff is responsible for everything from soggy equity markets to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/oil/story/0,11319,1287123,00.html">high gold prices</a> and various points in between. This gives me the impression that very many people seem to be very nervous.</p>
<p>One person who is probably very much worried about the state of the energy market is our favorite former oil man, George W. Bush. Could it be that the same stuff which greased his entry into business will be the very thing that will have him over a barrel come November?</p>
<p>What impact could higher oil prices have on the economy? With oil prices near $49 a barrel many economists are worried about the headwind that this generate for an economy which is rapidly losing momentum. Real people (i.e. not economists) are worried about higher prices for heating oil and gasoline.</p>
<p>These fears are justified. Every recession that the US has experienced in the past 30 years was preceded by a rise in the oil price. The price of oil is now over 50% higher than it was at the end of last year &#8211; it stands to reason that business and consumer spending power will be eroded if the oil price remains at such a high level.</p>
<p>The only good news is that US consumers have been reducing the amount of their income spent on energy over the past 20 years. In the 1980&#8217;s households spent around 8% of their income on energy products. This percentage dropped to under four percent in 2002 but has since risen back up to around 5% this year. Any further rise in prices will take this number higher again if income doesn&#8217;t rise as well. What this means is that disposable income will take a hit of up to 1% compared to last year. As the savings rate is already at near-record lows it probably won&#8217;t be possible to reduce the amount being saved to augment today&#8217;s income.</p>
<p>In fact the converse could hold true. A combination of daunting future prospects brought on by higher energy costs and a weak stock market (and/or a weak property market) could actually force consumers to reassess their current situation. If this causes them to increase their savings rate we could be looking at an even larger reduction in consumption. </p>
<p>A look at the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/nipa_underlying/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=19&#038;FirstYear=2003&#038;LastYear=2004&#038;Freq=Qtr">numbers</a> shows us that consumer spending on energy products and services was at around $418bn in the second quarter. If we factor in current prices and assume that we&#8217;ll have a normal winter we could be looking at an energy bill of &#8211; say &#8211; $465bn in Q4. This equates to around $90bn more than households  spent in Q4 of last year. This is roughly the sum that the last round of tax cuts put into consumer&#8217;s pockets in 2003. </p>
<p>This is not good news for the incumbent in the run-up to the election. If oil price hikes counteract the effect of the tax cuts and employment doesn&#8217;t improve, people will probably think twice before they answer the question &#8220;Are you better off than four years ago?&#8221; in the affirmative. I&#8217;m pretty sure that George W. Bush didn&#8217;t think that oil could have this kind of impact on his career when he founded Arbusto Energy in 1978.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20040818.shtml">Supply-side cheerleader Bob Novak</a> complained yesterday that the Congressional Budget Office had produced &#8220;political fodder for Democrats&#8221; by reporting how Bush&#8217;s tax cuts have reduced the share of taxes paid by the rich. Novak offered a surprisingly accurate description of the CBO report:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>That study concluded that <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5746&#038;sequence=0">President Bush&#8217;s cuts had shifted more of the tax burden from the nation&#8217;s rich to the middle class</a>, though everyone enjoyed an income tax reduction. </p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally the Bush campaign was upset, Novak writes, and they offered a different interpretation, emphasizing a different set of figures from the CBO report:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Taken by surprise last week, the Bush-Cheney campaign tried to recover by putting together a conference call for journalists and trying to beat the Democrats at the class warfare game with this message: Had no tax cuts been enacted, the top 20 percent of federal income-tax payers would have paid 78.4 percent, but the actual figure, because of the cuts, amounted to 82.1 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the Bush campaign says the CBO report is favorable to the Republicans, and shows that the tax system has gotten more progressive. Novak says the CBO report is favorable to the Democrats, and shows that the tax system has become less progressive. I think I may see a contradiction there.</p>
<p>Novak being Novak, he ignores the contradiction. Instead he calls for the CBO to produce numbers more favorable to the Republicans!</p>
<p>The Bush campaign is just adopting their usual tiresome spin, spouting figures that are technically true, but calculated to be misleading. They speak about federal <em>income</em> taxes, and hope that listeners will assume they&#8217;re talking about total federal taxes. The Bush campaign&#8217;s selective figures ignore all the rest of federal taxes including corporate income taxes, excise taxes, and payroll taxes.  They ignore estate taxes too (but so does the CBO).</p>
<p>If you look at all federal taxes, the CBO finds, the upper middle class is paying a bigger share of taxes because of Bush. The 60th to 80th percentiles are bearing an additional seven tenths of a percentage point of the federal tax burden (see the table at the end of this post). There hasn&#8217;t been much of a change for those in the bottom 60%. The top 20% did pretty well, paying a share six tenths of a percentage point smaller after Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.</p>
<p>The big action, though, is in Bush&#8217;s &#8220;base,&#8221; the very wealthy. The top 1%, with incomes averaging about a million dollars per year, saw their share of federal taxes fall from 21.9 percent to 20.1 percent, a drop of 1.8 percentage points. They&#8217;ve certainly been getting their money&#8217;s worth.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m looking forward to my week of co-blogging over here. I thought I&#8217;d start by pointing out how Angry Bear beat the NY Times yesterday. Kash wrote that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>the pause in the rise of the cost of health insurance in the mid 1990s&#8230;was due to the one-time transformation of the majority of health insurance plans to cheaper HMOs. That approach to solving the rising cost of health care has now run its course. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s fair to describe this explanation as the conventional wisdom among anyone with a little knowledge about health economics. HMOs are cheaper, so when consumers switch to them, health costs grow more slowly. But by now, there aren&#8217;t that many people left in traditional insurance plans: there&#8217;s no one left to switch. And while HMOs are cheaper, their costs generally rise just as rapidly as those of traditional insurance, because they&#8217;re driven by the same underlying forces (primarily technical change).</p>
<p>Compare Kash&#8217;s post to the Times&#8217; analysis:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The increase in health insurance premiums reflects the rising cost of health care, which is being driven by expensive new drugs, many of them heavily advertised to consumers; medical advances including diagnostic tests that require costly new machines; and a reaction to past restrictions in managed care health plans that sought to rein in costs. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Times isn&#8217;t wrong, exactly, they&#8217;re just missing a big and obvious part of the story. For that, you have to go to the blogosphere.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/business/19care.html?hp">has a story today</a> on the rising cost of health insurance, and its role as a factor making firms reluctant to hire more workers.  The price of health insurance has indeed risen remarkably fast recently, on par with the rates of increase in the early 1990s.  The graph below also illustrates the pause in the rise of the cost of health insurance in the mid 1990s, which was due to the one-time transformation of the majority of health insurance plans to cheaper HMOs.  That approach to solving the rising cost of health care has now run its course, and it is unlikely that we&#8217;ll see any effective new measures to control the cost of health care in the near future.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hins1.jpg"></p>
<p>Note one important caveat to this data, however: the data only shows average health care costs paid by employers.  It does not measure the total expenditures on health insurance, because it has no way to account for the greater share of health insurance costs that are being paid by employees.  So this chart may significantly understate the true rise in health insurance costs.</p>
<p>One result of the recent rise in health insurance costs is that workers are receiving a smaller share of their total compensation in the form of take-home pay.  The following chart shows how much of the average worker&#8217;s compensation comes in the form of wages and salaries.  It is currently nearing its all-time low of the early 1990s, and without any major changes to health care in the US, will surely surpass that level before long.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hins2.jpg"></p>
<p>The health care problem in the US is big, and getting bigger.  While one aspect of that is that more and more people must go without health care, an equally important aspect is the fact that &#8220;after-health care&#8221; disposible income will continue to fall, as health care costs eat up more and more of individuals&#8217; compensation.  I don&#8217;t see any good solution to this incessant march in health care costs without a major, MAJOR overhaul of how this nation provides health care to its citizens.  When the situation gets bad enough in the US, there will probably be political pressure to enact such changes, maybe in another 5 to 10 years.  But until then, we&#8217;ll have to deal with what we have.</p>
