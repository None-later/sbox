                                <p>From the <a href="http://www.mailtribune.com/archive/2004/0826/local/stories/01local.htm">Oregon Mail Tribune</a> (wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if the NYT or WaPo could break one of these stories?):<br />

<blockquote>&#8220;He and another officer now say we weren’t under fire at that time,&#8221; [Robert] Lambert [a crew member on swift boat PCF-51 on the day in question, March 13, 1969] said Wednesday afternoon. &#8220;Well, I sure was under the impression we were.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambert’s Bronze Star medal citation for the incident praises his courage under fire in the aftermath of a mine explosion that rocked another swift boat on that day 35 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anytime you are blown out of the water like that, they always follow that up with small arms fire,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>&#8230; Lambert has a photo album of swift boats, including several shots of Kerry’s PCF-94, although he doesn’t recall ever having met Kerry. One of his photographs of Kerry’s boat was taken on the morning of March 13, 1969, he added.</p>
<p>He flipped to a photograph of a bullet hole in the side of his swift boat — PCF-51.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s the bullet hole they keep talking about that they got the day before in the 51 boat — that was my purple heart,&#8221; he said, noting he was hit on the upper left arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;When those bullets hit that aluminum, it was like hitting glass,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There was shrapnel everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>His photographs include swift boats riddled from AK-47 rifle rounds and larger holes from rocket blasts.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, a 3/13/69 photo doesn&#8217;t prove the causal shot was fired that same day, but that&#8217;s how Lambert remembers it.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.reachm.com/amstreet/archives/001616.html">Via The American Street</a>, here&#8217;s another, this time in the <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/geauga/109351274315490.xml">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<br />For 35 years, Richard McCann largely kept his experiences as a swift boat commander in Vietnam to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a horror to war that you just can&#8217;t express, and would probably just as soon not deal with,&#8221; he recently explained.</p>
<p>But McCann, 60, recently broke his self-imposed silence in a very public way to respond to charges by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group accusing Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry of lying about and exaggerating his war record.</p>
<p>McCann said Wednesday that he was shocked by the accusations. He couldn&#8217;t believe the group was talking about the same man he served with in Vietnam in 1969; who joined him on missions in the Mekong Delta at a time when he said Navy swift-boat forces had an 85 percent chance of being killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&#8230; &#8220;When you have a scenario that is blatantly untrue and I&#8217;m in a unique position to say I was there, I feel it&#8217;s my responsibility to step forward,&#8221; McCann said.</p>
<p>In a letter published in Tuesday&#8217;s Plain Dealer, McCann wrote: &#8220;I said it in 1969 and I&#8217;ll say it again today: There is no one that I would rather have guarding my back in a war zone than John Kerry.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Census Bureau has just released its <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf">annual estimates of poverty, income, and health insurance coverage</a> for the US in 2003.  Some of the highlights:
<ul>
<li>Real median household income fell by .1%, from $43,381 to $43,318 between 2002 and 2003.  By contrast, in 2000, real median household income was $44,853.  Real household income has therefore fallen about 3.5% since 2000.  (Note that these are all pre-tax figures of household money income only.  Income received in kind, such as health insurance or retirement benefits, non-cash government transfer payments, etc. are not included in these figures.)</p>
</li>
<li>The rich got richer, the lower and middle class got poorer.  The bottom 60% of US families by income saw their average income fall by about .7%, while the top 40% of households saw their average income rise by about .3% between 2002 and 2003.
</li>
<li>The number of people living in poverty rose by 1.3 million, to 35.9 million.  This compares to a low of about 31 million people in the US living in poverty in 2000.  The percent of the US population living in poverty increased from 12.1% to 12.5%.
</li>
<li>States with declining real household income between 2001 and 2003 are AR, AZ, NC, KY, IL, PA, MA, and TX.  Note that the first three of these states were supposed to be solid Bush territory but are places where Kerry is doing surprisingly well, while PA was supposed to be a swing state, but seems to be fairly solidly in the Kerry camp at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also gives us some data regarding health insurance coverage in the US:
<ul>
<li>The US population grew by about 2.4 million between 2002 and 2003, while the number of people without health insurance grew by about 1.4 million.  The percent of the US population that lacked health insurance therefore rose from about 15.2% to 15.6% between 2002 and 2003.</p>
</li>
<li>The percent of the US population that received health insurance through their job fell from 61.3% to 60.4%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing in this report is particularly surprising, but it does put some concrete numbers on the worsening plight of the economically disadvantaged in the US during the past 3 years.  Such deterioration in the situation of the nation’s poorest households is normal during periods of slow economic growth.  That&#8217;s why this data reinforces the point that sitting around and just waiting for the economy to improve imposes serious, personal costs on lots of individuals.  Every month that goes by without economic improvement drives more people into poverty, deprives more people of adequate health care, and ruins families.  It’s sometimes hard to remember that there are real individuals comprising all of the economic data that we economists so blithely discuss, so it’s good to have a reminder.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Jonathan Weisman, writing in the Washington Post today, reports that Kerry&#8217;s plan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30071-2004Aug24.html">won&#8217;t balance the budget</a>.<br />
<blockquote> Sen. John F. Kerry&#8217;s pledge to reduce record federal budget deficits is colliding with an obstacle that may be growing higher by the week: his own campaign commitments. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is true enough. The credibility of Kerry&#8217;s pledge to cut the deficit rests on his promise to return to &#8220;pay-as-you-go&#8221; budgeting, his promise to jettison new programs that can&#8217;t be paid for, his reliance on a fiscally responsible economic team, and his own history of deficit-fighting. He hasn&#8217;t really made sufficient specific pledges to cut spending or raise taxes.</p>
<p>But it is emphatically not true that Kerry&#8217;s proposals are as fiscally irresponsible as Bush&#8217;s, which is what Weisman asserts:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>A Washington Post review of Kerry&#8217;s tax cuts and spending plans, in addition to interviews with campaign staff members and analyses by conservative and liberal experts, suggests that they could worsen the federal budget deficit by nearly as much as President Bush&#8217;s agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that Kerry&#8217;s campaign pledges are being compared to Bush&#8217;s budget. For a normal administration, a budget proposal would be a stronger commitment than a campaign promise. But Bush is no normal president, and his budgets can&#8217;t really be considered promises or commitments.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s compare Kerry&#8217;s pledge to repeal Bush&#8217;s tax cuts on the rich to Bush&#8217;s past budgetary promises. If Kerry is elected, and instead proposes making tax cuts for the rich permanent, he will rightly be accused of breaking a campaign promise. But if Bush&#8217;s budget is a promise, then Bush has also promised to eliminate his tax cuts for the rich, and indeed pretty much all his other tax cuts too. In his first and third budgets, these tax cuts were slated to expire at various points over the next decade. Now, in his forth budget, Bush proposes making the tax cuts permanent. Nobody has yet accused him of flip-flopping or breaking a promise. His budgets never really constituted promises: everyone knew he intended to break these commitments if he could.</p>
<p>The same is true of the Bush budget that&#8217;s being compared to Kerry&#8217;s proposals. It&#8217;s not worth the paper it&#8217;s printed on either. There are numerous examples of expensive promises Bush has made, that the Post ignores because they aren&#8217;t in his budget.</p>
<p>Bush has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/social-security/">repeatedly pledged</a> to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040120-7.html">partially privatize social security.</a>  The transition costs of this are in the trillion plus range, but <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2005/ssa.html">it&#8217;s not in his budget</a>.   Bush has endorsed permanent <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/108-2/hr4227sap-h.pdf">Alternative Minimum Tax</a> relief, a <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/5-4-04tax.htm">$376 billion dollar item</a> over the next ten years. But only the first of the the ten years is in his budget. The Bush administration has also endorsed the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/108-2/hr4520sap-h.pdf">grab bag of corporate tax breaks</a> currently being considered in Congress.  The CBPP estimates that <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-16-04tax.htm">these giveaways will cost $225 billion</a> over ten years.  But it&#8217;s not in his budget either.</p>
<p>According to the Post&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/daily/graphics/deficit_082504.html">Bottom Line</a>&#8221; table, Kerry would increase the deficit by $1.306 trillion, and Bush by $1.352 trillion. But that&#8217;s if you trust Bush&#8217;s budget and not his promises. Even a casual analysis of three big items on Bush&#8217;s current list of goodies for the corporations and the wealthy shows that Bush&#8217;s plans would put us at least another $3 trillion in the hole.</p>
<p>So sure, President Kerry may to back away from some of his spending proposals. He&#8217;s already said he will if he has to. But Bush has already backed away from the &#8220;promises&#8221; made in his budget, just as he has backed away from numerous commitments made in earlier budgets. Nobody else in the country takes Bush&#8217;s budgets seriously. Why does the Post?</p>

                                <p>Ben Ginsberg’s resignation may be the <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;e=1&#038;u=/ap/20040825/ap_on_el_pr/veterans_group_bush">big story</a> as far as linkages between Bush-Cheney and the infamous Swift Boat liars. <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000039.html">Brad Delong</a> notes the sad tale of how Robert Dole will say anything to help Bush in this campaign.</p>
<p>So what has been up with the fellow that Scooter Libby got to out a CIA operative?  In <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0408/21/cg.00.html">this</a> exchange over the Swift Boat lies with Al Hunt, Robert Novak fires off “You made a statement that there was nobody in the boat who was against him. Don&#8217;t be so sure of that”.</p>
<p>Now the transcript misses Novak’s self-assuredness that he knows something Hunt did not know.  Now we find out the name of Novak’s mystery witness: Steve Gardner.  Who is Steve Gardner?  </p>
<p><a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200408240001">This</a> tells us all we need to know – as Gardner admitted that “he was not on the boat with Kerry during the incidents for which Kerry got his medals”.</p>
<p>No, I’m not surprised that Novak misleads again.  But since we know Novak is a puppet of the Bush White House – so wouldn’t it be nice if he’d tell us who gave him this little leak?<br /></p>

                                <p>Max Cleland wanted to personally deliver <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/25/cleland.letter/index.html">this</a> letter to the President. Of course, George W. Bush is trying to avoid responsibility for the Swift Boat smears any way he can.  I figured Bush’s running ability might allow him to stay ahead of Cleland in his wheelchair and it looks like I was right:</p>
<blockquote><p>(CNN) &#8212; Vietnam veteran and former Sen. Max Cleland said Wednesday that attack ads questioning Sen. John Kerry&#8217;s combat record in Vietnam were &#8220;scurrilous&#8221; and &#8220;dishonest and dishonorable&#8221; and called on President Bush to come out against them. Cleland, who lost both legs and an arm in the war, told reporters gathered at a school near Bush&#8217;s Texas ranch that the commercials run by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth were false and that &#8220;George Bush is behind it.&#8221; &#8220;The question is, where is George Bush&#8217;s honor? The question is where is his shame?&#8221; Cleland asked. &#8220;To attack a fellow veteran who has distinguished himself &#8230; in combat, regardless of the political combat involved, is disgraceful.&#8221; He said he was unsuccessful in trying to deliver a letter to President Bush urging him to condemn the ads. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Has it peaked?  Will it fall?  </p>
<p>Data on existing home sales in July was released yesterday by the National Association of Realtors.   It showed a slight drop in sales, but still a very active market.  From <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BB25068C6-BBFB-4DC6-BA3F-BA223BEAE0BE%7D&#038;siteid=mktw">CBSMarketwatch</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>July&#8217;s drop was larger than expected. Economists had been expecting a decline to 6.85 million from the initial estimate of 6.95 million pace in June.  [But] despite the decline in July, existing home sales are at their third-highest level ever following record-setting sales in May and June. Sales at this level are &#8220;a real eye-popper,&#8221; said David Lereah, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ehs1.jpg"></p></blockquote>
<p>Yet signs are growing that the market may be peaking.  In California, which has had the hottest housing market, several news stories have appeared in the last week or two speculating that we&#8217;ve reached the top of the market.  For example, the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/20/HOMES.TMP">SF Chronicle</a> reported last week that</p>
<blockquote><p>Bay Area home prices and sales last month throttled back from their record-setting pace in June, signaling what could be the start of a cooling trend in the local housing market, according to some experts. </p>
<p>The median price for a home in the nine Bay Area counties in July was $514,000, down 0.4 percent from July&#8217;s median of $516,000. On a month-to-month basis, sales declined 8.8 percent, with a total of 12,862 houses and condos changing hands last month, compared with 14,104 in June, a study by DataQuick of La Jolla (San Diego County) found.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://rismedia.com/index.php/article/articleview/7438/1/1/">Orange County Register</a> had the following to report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Orange County&#8217;s hot housing market is cooling, according to the latest comprehensive monthly data. Countywide numbers released Wednesday by market tracker DataQuick reinforced what real-estate agents have been seeing first hand and earlier reports that covered only parts of the county. </p>
<p>Builders and real-estate agents sold 4,193 homes last month &#8212; 17 percent fewer than a year earlier, DataQuick said. The number of homes sold last month made it the slowest July since 2000. </p>
<p>&#8230;Orange County, which is historically the most expensive market in Southern California, had the region&#8217;s weakest housing market in July. The county recorded the biggest annual drop in sales activity and the smallest annual appreciation in price.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what a peaking market looks like.  Declines in housing market activity start with the markets that have appreciated the fastest, and spread from there.  By the end of this year housing markets may well be cooling in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>What does Alan Greenspan do then?</p>

                                <p>Greg Mankiw’s Sunday New York Times oped is critically reviewed by Brad DeLong <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000020.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Mankiw tries to convince his readers that the unemployment rate is a better measure of the labor market than the payroll employment figure (interestingly both show we are worse off than when Bush took office).  In a rather long disagreement with Mankiw’s oped, DeLong asks the right questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>So are there reasons to think that the unemployment rate is a better measure of the state of the job market than the payroll employment count? The answer to this question hinges on what has happened to the 3.5 million extra people who&#8211;surprisingly, given what the unemployment rate has been doing &#8211; don&#8217;t have jobs. Do they lack jobs because they would not want jobs even if the labor market were in its normal full-employment configuration &#8211; because they would rather be raising children or going to school or traveling around the world or living the life of Reilly in some manner? Or are they people who would want jobs if the labor market were in its normal full-employment configuration, but who don&#8217;t have jobs because the labor market is depressed and have decided to try to do something else with their time&#8211;in which case they are raising children or going to school or traveling around the world not as a free choice but as a second-best. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there is another measure of the labor market, which Brad DeLong often discusses, that being the civilian-employment population ratio, which stood at 64.4% as of January 2001, but fell to 62.2% by August 2003 where it basically stayed until May 2004.  As of July 2004, it was reported at 62.5%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mankiw may have anticipated <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/fastest-growth-in-four-years.html">this</a> as he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now the economy is heading in the right direction. Over the past year, the gross domestic product has grown by 4.8 percent, among the fastest rates in 20 years, and the economy has shown a net gain of about 1.5 million jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the fastest rates in 20 years?  Clever way of not saying “fastest growth rate since Bush took office”?<br /></p>

                                <p>According the a Zogby telephone poll from last week, &#8220;<a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=851">voters with active passports prefer Kerry 58% to 35%</a>, while those without a passport are for Bush 48% to 39%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s some subtle interpretations of this finding: maybe passport holders are more common along the Canadian Border, and states like Washington, Minnesota, and Maine tend to be more Democratic. Holding a passport is presumably correlated with income and immigrant status.</p>
<p>But my guess is that were you to carefully control for all the relevant background characteristics, the straightforward interpretation would turn out to be right. People who are more familiar with other countries and are less provincial, are naturally more aware of how Bush is destroying America&#8217;s reputation, alliances, and influence abroad. And so they&#8217;re more likely to support Kerry.</p>

Oh, after you&#8217;ve read it for a few years, it becomes a little repetitious, and you become a little tired of Dean Baker&#8217;s hobby horses, but it&#8217;s still well worth reading.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s issue is particularly good, offering, among other things, a debunking of the NY Times&#8217; frequent calls for Europeans to work harder, roll back their welfare state, and generally act more like Americans.  I&#8217;m not sure if this is a case of the &#8220;so-called liberal media&#8221; living up to its name, or proof that there&#8217;s no one so provincial as a New Yorker.*</p>

<blockquote>Europe Ponders the Meaning of Life<br />
<br />Mark Landler<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/weekinreview/15land.html?ex=1250308800&#038;en=7b6cd49e507d2d75&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland"><i>New York Times</i>, August 15, 2004, Section 4 Page 1</a></p>
<p>    This article reports on the prospects that the European welfare state will be rolled back in the future. It makes numerous assertions about economic necessity that are not supported by any evidence and contradict economic theory. For example, the article assets that the conditions that allowed for Europeans to enjoy long vacations, short workweeks, and a generous welfare state were &#8220;an anomaly.&#8221; In fact, Europe&#8217;s economies all continue to experience productivity growth of between 1 and 2 percent annually. This means that their economies are continuing to grow richer through time, allowing workers to enjoy both higher standards of living and a continued decline in working hours. There are no economic projections whatsoever that productivity will stop growing; therefore it is difficult to understand the basis for the assertion, made repeatedly in this article, that Europeans will have to accept less leisure in the future.   </p>
<p>At several points the article attributes the need to work longer hours to globalization. In standard economic theory, trade makes countries richer, not poorer. While globalization may raise issues of distribution, it will not make European countries too poor to maintain their current standards of living.   </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Proponents of the Bush Social Security partial privatization plan wish to pretend there is some free lunch as if taking $10 out of the Social Security Trust Fund and placing it into private retirement accounts would turn the $10 bill into a $20 bill.  Free lunch proposals are often based on flakey economics or bad finance.  </p>
<p>Andrew Abel noted in “The Effects of Investing Social Security Funds in the Stock Market When Fixed Costs Prevent Some Households from Holding Stocks” (American Economic Review, March 2001 and NBER Working Paper 7739):</p>
<blockquote><p>Some economists have argued that investing part of the Social Security Trust Fund in equity is simply a rearrangement of paper assets without any real allocational effects, and they have described such a policy as a “shell game.” The shell game argument is similar to the Ricardian equivalence proposition in public finance and macroeconomics and the Modigliani-Miller theorem in corporate finance. The argumentis that private investors will react to any rearrangement of the social security system’s portfolio in a way that completely neutralizes the effect of the portfolio change. For example, if the social security system sells a dollar of bonds and purchases a dollar of equity, private investors would buy a dollar of bonds and sell a dollar of equity.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the title suggests, his paper considers the implications of a particular deviation from the perfect capital market model.  To consider the perfect capital model, however, assume Joe has $300,000 in a private retirement account (PRA) and realizes that the government trust fund (GTF) is managing $200,000 for his benefit.  Using the model from James Tobin’s “Liquidity Preference as Behaviour Towards Risk” (Review of Economics Studies, 1958), consider Joe’s choices are a risk-free bond with a 3% return and a stock portfolio with an expected return = 9% and a risk-index = 20.  Imagine Joe’s preferences are such that he wishes to have half of his total retirement portfolio in stocks so his overall expected return = 6% and his overall risk taking is 10.  Currently, GTF holds only bonds so Joe puts $50,000 of PRA into bonds with 80% of it in stocks.  </p>
<p>The Clinton idea was akin to taking one-fourth of the GTF and placing it into stocks so the expected return for GTF would rise to 4.5%.  But Joe realizes that places his overall risk-index at 12 so even though his overall expected return rises to 6.6%, he is no longer optimally balancing expected return and risk.  So Joe simply calls the manager of his PRA and asks that it now have $100,000 in bonds and only $200,000 in stocks.  In other words, his entire portfolio including the GTF and the PRA would be half stocks and half bonds regardless of how the GTF is managed.  </p>
<p>Proponents of the Bush Social Security partial privatization plan wish us to believe that reducing the GTF from $200,000 to $150,000 and giving Joe the difference would induce Joe to hold more stocks.  But if Joe was already optimally balancing expected return and risk, he would simply place this $50,000 in the bond portion of his PRA.  Are the proponents of the Bush Social Security partial privatization plan telling us Joe was not already optimally balancing expected return and risk?  If so, would not rational Joe have taken some of his PRA bonds and allocated them to stocks even before the partial privatization?<br /></p>
