                                <p>CBSMarketwatch.com has a couple of interesting stories for China-watchers.  The first reports that it seems increasingly certainl that China <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?dist=&#038;param=archive&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;guid=%7BBD5F2F6F-84B1-4915-BE66-15C3E1901E4D%7D&#038;garden=&#038;minisite=">will not revalue the yuan</a> any time soon.  The second surveys some of China&#8217;s <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B55B4631C-1F7E-4388-9B64-F062A9C452A5%7D&#038;siteid=mktw">recent economic statistics</a>.  Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>Third-quarter gross domestic product grew 9.1 percent compared with the July-September period last year, slowing from the previous quarter&#8217;s 9.6 percent and the first quarter&#8217;s 9.8 percent, as the government took steps to cool the economy. GDP grew 9.5 percent on year in the first nine months of 2004, the National Bureau of Statistics said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Other data showed the economy is still booming. China&#8217;s fixed-asset investment &#8212; which accounts for about half of GDP &#8212; rose 27.7 percent in the January-September period, and industrial production rose 17 percent.</p>
<p>Another good sign: the month-on-month rise in China&#8217;s consumer price index slowed to 5.2 percent in September from 5.3 percent in both July and August, slightly below China&#8217;s key one-year lending rate of 5.31 percent. </p>
<p>&#8230;China&#8217;s central bank started tightening money supply and credit growth in the second half of last year by raising some banks&#8217; reserve requirements and advising banks to restrict lending in &#8220;hot&#8221; sectors, including auto, steel, cement, aluminum and real estate&#8230; Data released earlier this month showed the central bank&#8217;s broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 13.9 percent on year in September, compared with the central bank&#8217;s 17 percent growth target.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that China will not revalue the yuan until they need revaluation as another tool to slow down their money supply growth and cool their economy.  But this collection of data suggests that they may be acheiving those goals without it.</p>

                                <p>The biggest single decision that Bush has made during his presidency – to launch a US takeover of Iraq in order to protect the US from Iraq&#8217;s WMDs – revealed substantially poor judgment.  UN inspections could have achieved exactly the same result as the invasion as far as WMDs are concerned, but with dramatically lower costs.  In this post I&#8217;ll try to summarize the evidence for this argument.</p>
<p>Note that this is a different issue from the manifest incompetence that the Bush administration displays daily in the running of post-Saddam Iraq.  The utterly inept management of Iraq since April 2003 is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/breathtaking-work-of-staggering.html">staggering</a>, but if I limit myself to just <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/why-im-voting-for-kerry.html">five reasons to vote for Kerry</a> it is trumped by the dangerously poor judgment that Bush displayed in making the decision to invade in the first place.</p>
<p>Supporters of Bush’s decision to invade Iraq argue that until we invaded, the best intelligence we had indicated that Iraq had WMDs, and that Bush could only base his decision on the information he had at the time.  But the premise of this argument is quite wrong.</p>
<p>There is a lot of specific, well-documented evidence to show that the White House knew <strong>BEFORE</strong> they launched the invasion of Iraq that the case for Iraq’s WMDs was faulty.  The data that indicated that Iraq might have WMDs consisted of relatively few pieces of information &#8212; and at the time of Bush&#8217;s decision to go to war, <em>the White House already knew that each of those pieces of evidence was probably wrong</em>. </p>
<p>Bush presented the best evidence for WMDs in Iraq in his State of the Union in 2003, and Powell described it in detail in his address to the UN in February 2003.
<ul>
<li>Bush and Powell both cited as evidence that Iraq had WMDs the allegation that Iraq had tried to obtain uranium from Niger.  Yet the White House knew that this was untrue back in 2002, due to the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0706-02.htm">CIA investigation</a> led by Wilson.  And while the results of Wilson’s investigation were concealed by the White House until after the invasion, it was still <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/14/sprj.irq.documents/">publicly known</a> through other sources that the Iraq-Niger story was untrue in March 2003, before Bush launched the invasion.  So there can be no doubt that Bush knew that this evidence of Iraq’s WMDs was mythical when he made his decision to invade.</p>
</li>
<li>Bush and Powell both said that Iraq had tried to obtain aluminum tubes that were specifically for their nuclear program.  However, back in 2002 experts from both the Dept. of Energy and Dept of State told the White House (and Powell) that the tubes were actually probably <a href="http://webexhibits.org/bush/9.html">not for a nuclear program</a>.  And in February of 2003 the International Atomic Energy Agency <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.elbaradei/">reported its assessment</a> that &#8220;Based on available evidence, the IAEA team has concluded that Iraq&#8217;s efforts to import these aluminum tubes were not likely to have been related to the manufacture of centrifuges.&#8221;  Again, this reveals that at the time of his decision Bush knew that this did not constitute evidence of WMDs in Iraq.
</li>
<li>Powell also presented an array of all of the other evidence that the US had that Iraq had WMDs, including some dramatic satellite photos showing supposed WMD activity.  However, even before Powell made his speech his own intelligence analysts warned that many of the pieces of evidence in his speech <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0715-05.htm">should not be included</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, as most of us have read by now, the Bush administration <a href="http://www.nbcnco.com/main/dos_test.htm">pressured analysts</a> to come up with intelligence evidence that there were WMDs.  Furthermore, the Bush administration systematically revealed only intelligence that supported their claims that Iraq had WMDs, while ignoring or suppressing evidence that Iraq did not have WMDs. Because they had caused these <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?031027fa_fact">changes in the intelligence-filtering process</a> themselves, the administration knew full well that the intelligence they were relying on was incomplete and unreliable.</p>
<p>As a result, a large group of intelligence veterans from the CIA and other agencies, including Democrats and Republicans alike, wrote this in <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0501-09.htm">a letter to the White House</a>: &#8220;While there have been occasions in the past when intelligence has been deliberately warped for political purposes, never before has such warping been used in such a systematic way to mislead our elected representatives into voting to authorize launching a war.&#8221; </p>
<p>Furthermore, while the evidence <em><strong>for</strong></em> WMDs in Iraq was known by the Bush administration to be weak or bogus, the positive evidence <em><strong>against</strong></em> WMDs in Iraq was steadily growing.  The UN weapons inspections regime was working, and making it more clear with each passing week that there were no WMDs in Iraq.  From Hans Blix&#8217;s <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/blix14Febasdel.htm">testimony to the UN</a> in February of 2003: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Since we arrived in Iraq, we have conducted more than 400 inspections covering more than 300 sites.  All inspections were performed without notice, and access was almost always provided promptly.  In no case have we seen convincing evidence that the Iraqi side knew in advance that the inspectors were coming.”</p>
<p>“Inspections are effectively helping to bridge the gap in knowledge that arose due to the absence of inspections between December 1998 and November 2002.  More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites.  Three-quarters of these have been screened using our own analytical laboratory capabilities at the Baghdad Centre (BOMVIC).  The results to date have been consistent with Iraq’s declarations.”</p>
<p>“In my 27 January update to the Council, I said that it seemed from our experience that Iraq had decided in principle to provide cooperation on process, most importantly prompt access to all sites and assistance to UNMOVIC in the establishment of the necessary infrastructure. This impression remains, and we note that access to sites has so far been without problems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These statements indicate pretty clearly that UN inspections were gaining access wherever they needed to, that Iraq was cooperating to a reasonable degree, and that it was becoming increasingly clear that there were no WMDs.  And again, let me reiterate the crucial point: Bush knew all of this BEFORE he decided to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>What’s the significance of all of this?  Simple: Bush thought that Iraq had WMDs despite the overwhelming preponderance of evidence at his disposal (and which turned out to be exactly right) that indicated that Iraq did not.  The fact that Bush could make such a grave and costly decision based on his “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html">instincts</a>” rather than on actual evidence displays a disturbing lack of connectedness to the real world.  </p>
<p>If Bush were only using that poor judgment to make bad business or personal decisions (as his lousy record as a businessman suggests he has consistently done), then that would be his own problem.  But he&#8217;s our president.  We can not afford to have a president with a proven record of such catastrophically poor judgment.  And that’s another reason why I’m voting for Kerry.</p>

In fact, it&#8217;s generally not as good under Republicans as it is under Democrats. Reader and commenter Spencer (thanks!) was kind enough to construct the following graphic illustration:(*)</p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/RBgdp.gif"></center><br />
<br />Bush II started out below the average GDP growth for a Republican, has now made it up to about average for a Republican, but remains well below the average GDP growth mark set by Democratic presidents.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) To clarify the graph, the underlying data are quarterly, dating back to 1948; year zero for each president corresponds to inauguration (e.g., for Bush II, year zero is Q1 of 2001). So the vertical axis shows the cumulative compounded GDP growth to date. For example, GDP is about 9% higher now than when Bush took office. In contrast, averaging over the Democratic administrations from 1948-2000, GDP was about 12.5% higher 3.75 years than when the Democrat took office. That&#8217;s a 3.5% difference, this year alone, or about 400 billion dollars.<br /></p>

                                <p>Normally I don’t pay too much attention to the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators.  I’m not at all convinced that they have good predictive power; at best I think they reflect the overall trend in the economy at a particular point in time.  But <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/10/21/news/economy/leading_indicators/index.htm">this story</a> caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Economic indicator sinks for 4th month </strong><br />
<br />Conference Board&#8217;s index of leading indicators slips 0.1%, matching forecasts.</p>
<p>NEW YORK (CNN/Money) &#8211; A gauge meant to forecast the economy&#8217;s direction fell for the fourth straight month in September, a research group reported Thursday, matching forecasts on Wall Street.</p></blockquote>
<p>Four straight months of declines does seem to suggest a trend, I think.  I almost hate to say it, but perhaps more people are starting to share my worries about how the economy will do in 2005.</p>

                                <p>In case you&#8217;ve missed it, last week <em>The Guardian</em> started &#8220;Operation Clark County.&#8221;  The idea was that they would facilitate letter-writing from British citizens concerned about the US election to undecided voters in a semi-rural county in central Ohio.</p>
<p>How has it gone?  <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> (a right-of-center British newspaper) says <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/21/ngraun21.xml&#038;sSheet=/news/2004/10/21/ixhome.html">not so well</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>British intervention in poll backfires</strong></p>
<p>Dan Harkins, a political activist in the vital swing state of Ohio, was excited when he first heard that the Guardian newspaper was recruiting readers to write to voters in his state in the hopes of giving foreigners a voice in the American election.</p>
<p>&#8230;The first letters to be made public all urged Clark County voters to reject Mr Bush. As he watched the reaction of friends and neighbours, Mr Harkins was delighted.</p>
<p>He is the chairman of the Clark County Republican Party, and his neighbours&#8217; reaction was outrage. &#8220;It&#8217;s hysterical,&#8221; laughed Mr Harkins, showing off sheaves of incensed e-mails and notes from local voters.</p>
<p>The Republicans&#8217; delight compares with the gloom among local Democrats, who fear that &#8220;foreign interference&#8221; is hurting Mr Kerry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did it ever occur to the Guardian that their idea might backfire?  Apparently it did.  This is what the Guardian wrote today about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1332041,00.html">Operation Clark County</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not as if we didn&#8217;t consider the possibility that our project might have precisely the opposite effect to that intended&#8230; It&#8217;s just that we didn&#8217;t believe it. For one thing, it seemed unlikely that our campaign would ever reach a scale that would have any real impact on the election, one way or another. For another, it seemed spectacularly patronising to suggest that the people of Clark County would be so volatile that they would vote one way simply because an individual several thousand miles away had suggested they do the opposite.</p>
<p>&#8230;We set out to get people talking and thinking about the impact of the US election on citizens of other countries, and that is what we have done. For the Guardian to have experienced such a backlash to an editorial project is extraordinary, but the number of complaints are thoroughly outdone by the number of people who engaged positively with the project. What other lessons can we draw from Operation Clark County? I guess we will have to wait till November 3 to find out for sure, but here&#8217;s a provisional stab: there are a huge number of people around the world who are profoundly dismayed by the prospect of another four years of a Bush White House and who are desperate for a way to do something about it; Guardian readers are a reassuringly engaged, resourceful and largely charming bunch; parts of America have become so isolationist that even the idea of individuals receiving letters from foreigners is enough to give politicians the collywobbles and, perhaps, in the digital age little acorns can turn into big trees very, very quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was all quite predictable, I suppose.  If nothing else, it makes for extremely entertaining political theater.</p>

                                <p>As I&#8217;ve said many times, I think that Bush is not responsible for the weakness of the economy in 2001.  A recession was bound to happen at the end of the long uninterrupted expansion of the 1990s – <strong>all</strong> expansions end with a recession, after all.  And as Brad DeLong put it in a <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000212.html">WSJ interview</a>, &#8220;Presidents influence the economy. They don&#8217;t control it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while the president can’t manipulate the month-to-month movements in the economy, and can&#8217;t defy the economic laws of gravity, there are some very real ways that a president can affect the economy.  The most important of those ways is through his control of federal taxing and spending policy.  In the rest of this post, I will focus on just one aspect of these policies: Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of Bush’s economic policy has been tax cuts.  Though the original motivation behind the tax cuts was principally ideological, both the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were sold as job creation machines (see <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/~dpc/pubs/108-1-186.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/js02.htm">here</a> for examples).  The latter was even titled &#8220;The Jobs and Growth Act&#8221;, and involved promises that it would create 1.4 million new jobs. </p>
<p>But even before the tax cuts were enacted, it was clear to many economists that most of the provisions in the tax cuts had nothing to do with stimulating the economy.  How would a reduction in estate taxes help the recovery?  How would tax cuts that were primarily scheduled to take effect in the years 2005-2010 help the recovery?  After all, of the $350 billion total cost of the 2003 tax cut, only $60 billion or so was spent in 2003, and even the 2004 portion accounted for less than half of the total (see <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxModel/tmdb/Content/PDF/JCX-55-03.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, 70% percent of the tax cuts that did take effect in 2003 were destined for the 15% of taxpayers with the highest incomes (see <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxModel/tmdb/TMTemplate.cfm?DocID=433&#038;topic2ID=150&#038;topic3ID=152&#038;DocTypeID=1">here</a>).  Economists have always understood that high-income individuals spend less of any windfall they receive than middle or low-income individuals.  So (as I explained in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/why-bushs-tax-cuts-failed.html">this post</a>) it&#8217;s no mystery why most economists never really expected the tax cuts to stimulate the economy: they were never designed to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>The evidence that economists were right about this is striking and pervasive.  By various measures, the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/so-hows-that-recovery-doing-anyway.html">recovery is weaker</a> than any other in recent history.   The lack of new jobs created by the economy during this recovery has been widely commented upon (including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/summarizing-bushs-job-creation-record.html">by me</a>), but the weak recovery is also reflected in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/household-income-rising-or-falling.html">low growth in workers’ take-home pay</a>.  Put it all together and you get economic performance that is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/bush-economy-in-context.html">dismal</a> relative to typical US economic performance over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>So given that economists knew that the tax cuts wouldn’t help the economy, and given that the administration was committed to the idea of passing some sort of large tax cut, why not try to redesign the tax cuts to be more effective?  At this point we have to blame both Bush&#8217;s economic advisors (see articles <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2072281">here</a>, <a href="http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_SP04_Barnes.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_SP04_Frankel.pdf">here</a> for examples of the widespread feeling that Bush&#8217;s economic advisors have been mediocre at best), and Bush himself, who (judging by how he runs <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000018.html">meetings about economic policy</a>) seems to have little interest in or understanding of how the economy works.</p>
<p>So while Bush has spent hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, supposedly to help stimulate the economy, the effects on the recovery were modest because of their bad design. This is one reason why it is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/economists-agree-bushs-economic-policy.html">clear to most economists</a> that Bush&#8217;s management of the US economy has been poor.</p>
<p>It will not be hard for Kerry to do better on that score.  But chances are that Kerry will do far more than just beat the low standards set by the Bush administration.  </p>
<p>Kerry&#8217;s economic advisors are largely former Clinton administration advisors, who have a proven track record of being able to guide the economy to sustained and robust growth through good times and bad.  They faced an economy that threatened to move into recession in 1995, numerous foreign financial crises (including in Mexico, our second-biggest trading partner), and the near collapse of the US&#8217;s financial system (thanks to LTCM), and yet were able to use the president&#8217;s influence to keep the economy growing smoothly through it all.  </p>
<p>The fact that Kerry is putting his trust in such competent, experienced economic advisors means that the economic management of the US will immediately go from poor to quite good if Kerry is elected.  That&#8217;s one reason why I&#8217;m voting for Kerry.</p>

<blockquote><p>TEHRAN, Iran &#8212; The head of Iran&#8217;s security council said Tuesday that the re-election of President Bush was in Tehran&#8217;s best interests, despite the administration&#8217;s &#8220;axis of evil&#8221; label, accusations that Iran harbors al-Qaida terrorists, and threats of sanctions for the country&#8217;s nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>Historically, Democrats have harmed Iran more than Republicans, said Hasan Rowhani, head of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran&#8217;s top security decision-making body.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an economics paper just begging to be written:</p>
<blockquote><p>SALEM, Ore. (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/10/19/real_estate/buying_selling/politics/index.htm">CNN/Money</a>) &#8211; Less than two weeks away from Election Day, political signs on front yards are in full bloom. Lined up, they make quite an impression &#8212; suddenly, a neighborhood appears liberal, conservative or &#8220;politically diverse.&#8221; </p>
<p>For some homebuyers, that is reason to give houses on the block a second look, or to just keep on driving. </p>
<p>&#8230;Although no study has been done about whether political signs influence people&#8217;s homebuying decisions, said Nathan Kelly, an assistant professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, it stands to reason that they would.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are people on the right or left bothered more by signs for the opposite party?  Who pays more of a premium to live near people of their own political affiliation? How large is the effect, either positive or negative?  Interesting questions. Now we just need some data&#8230;</p>

                                <p><em>The Economist</em> notes some gathering distress over the <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3306218">price of oil</a>.  But Greenspan, in <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200410152/default.htm">a speech last Friday</a>, presented another incarnation of his seemingly boundless optimism.  Some highlights from his speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>While there are concerns of seeming inadequate levels of investment to meet expected rising world demand for oil over coming decades, technology, given a more supportive environment, is likely to ensure the needed supplies, at least for a very long while.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re not going to run out of oil any time soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>[L]ong-term price tranquility has faded dramatically over the past four years. Prices for delivery in 2010 of light, low-sulphur crude rose to more than $35 per barrel when spot prices touched near $49 per barrel in late August. Rising geopolitical concerns about insecure reserves and the lack of investment to exploit them appear to be the key sources of upward pressure on distant future prices. However, the most recent runup in spot prices to nearly $55 per barrel, attributed largely to the destructive effects of Hurricane Ivan, left the price for delivery in 2010 barely above its August high. This suggests that part of the recent rise in spot prices is expected to wash out over the longer run.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: the main reason for the spike in oil prices right now is Hurricane Ivan, so we&#8217;ll see prices fall substantially again soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, despite its recent surge, the average price of crude oil in real terms is still only three-fifths of the price peak of February 1981. Moreover, the impact of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove less consequential to economic growth and inflation than in the 1970s. So far this year, the rise in the value of imported oil&#8211;essentially a tax on U.S. residents&#8211;has amounted to about 3/4 percent of GDP. The effects were far larger in the crises of the 1970s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: don&#8217;t worry.  Even though the US has essentially paid the equivalent of an $85 billion tax increase due to higher oil prices this year, things aren&#8217;t as bad as they were during the 1970s.  </p>
<p>As an aside, I wonder how Greenspan would have reacted to a proposal to raise income taxes by $85 billion this year?  Would he have dismissed its economic effects just as casually?</p>
<p>Finally, for those who like keeping track, here&#8217;s the latest update in oil prices since the start of 2004.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The other day, my 10 year old niece asked me why I am going to vote for John Kerry.  I must admit that I was at a bit of a loss.  I didn’t know where to begin.  There are so <em><strong>many</strong></em> ways in which I prefer Kerry to Bush, after all, so I found it surprisingly tricky to give a concise answer.  </p>
<p>All of us here at Angry Bear have written dozens of posts identifying specific problems with Bush&#8217;s presidency, specific examples of how Bush does not make a good president, or specific improvements in policy that Kerry would implement if he’s elected.  But my niece&#8217;s question started me wondering: is it possible to summarize and consolidate all of those dozens of individual facts into a coherent, concise statement about why I’m voting for John Kerry?  The <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> is in the midst of a similar exercise, but they’re coming up with <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/special_packages/endorsement/">21 reasons to vote for Kerry</a> over Bush.  I feel like that’s too many; if you can come up with 21 reasons, why not 121?  Surely they exist.  </p>
<p>No – I’m convinced that it should be possible to whittle things down further.  So here’s my attempt.  I’ve arbitrarily decided to boil things down to just five major points. (I was initially trying to get it down to just three reasons, but in the end I couldn’t be that constrained.)  In order of increasing importance they are:
<ol>
<li>The economy: Bush&#8217;s economic policies to address the recession were awful, indicating a deep lack of understanding of how the economy works, in addition to a lack of trust in well-respected economic advisors.</p>
</li>
<li>Iraq: Bush&#8217;s biggest decision – invading Iraq – displayed poor judgment on his part, in part because it reflected Bush’s dangerous propensity to make decisions based on ideology rather than fact.
</li>
<li>Democracy: The Bush administration has had an unprecedented penchant for censoring information (often by rewriting history) and stifling democratic dissent, imposing substantial new constraints on the functioning of the democratic process.
</li>
<li>The budget: Kerry will restore fiscal discipline to Washington, and thus staunch the flow of IOUs that Bush is currently handing to my 2 year old daughter.
</li>
<li>Terrorism: Kerry will fight terrorism more effectively than Bush is able to, by leading a united coalition of all of the world’s major democracies, as well as by marginalizing violent Islamic fundamentalists rather than turning them into local heroes as Bush does.</li>
</ol>
<p>To whittle it all down to just these five points I had to leave out a lot of incredibly important reasons to vote for Kerry over Bush: health care, the growth of corporate power and influence, the unprecedented disregard for scientific research in the policy process in the Bush administration, Bush&#8217;s general reliance on ideology over empirical facts in decision-making, environmental protection, and education, to name just a few.</p>
<p>But after putting all of those other things aside, I think that I’ve reduced things down to what are for me the five most important things that this election is about.  Over the next week I’m going to write up my specific arguments for each of those five reasons to vote for Kerry, as an exercise in synthesizing and summarizing some of the myriad of individual facts that we&#8217;ve noted over the past three years.  I think it&#8217;s helpful to do this, because sometimes I think that we focus so much on the trees that we forget about the forest, so to speak.  It&#8217;s good to remind ourselves of the broad, over-arching reasons why Kerry will be a better president than Bush has been.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to play at home, the rules are simple: come up with a list of the five (or fewer, if you can do it) most important reasons to vote for Kerry over Bush.  Personally, I think you should also consider how you could support your assertions with concrete documentary evidence, but maybe that&#8217;s the teacher in me talking.  Most importantly, your list should simply reflect what you think is at the heart of this election.</p>
<p>Have fun.  I&#8217;ll be back with my argument about the economy tomorrow.</p>
