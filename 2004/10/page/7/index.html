                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>From <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6243023/">last night&#8217;s debate</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BUSH: Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.  Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.  And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.  And there&#8217;s no market forces involved with health care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.  These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>BUSH: Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation&#8217;s capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ummm, so&#8230; are decisions actually being made by the consumers of health care, or are they not?</p>
<p>More seriously, Bush&#8217;s first statement on health care struck me as extraordinary.  He seems to agree with the premise that market forces don&#8217;t work in the health care industry.  I must confess that I was somewhat dumbstruck when he said so, because that is actually a perceptive insight, based on sound economics.</p>
<p>But then why is he so committed to &#8220;market solutions&#8221; to the nation&#8217;s health care problem?  How do health savings accounts, which apparently are supposed to go toward buying more private insurance plans, address this fundamental problem?  Bush was quite right to say that consumers of health care are not involved in the decision-making process, and that market forces don&#8217;t work in health care.  But then follow that economic logic to its conclusion &#8211; economics 101 teaches us that market failures are a prime reason for government intervention.  Bush spelled out quite clearly the case for more government intervention in the health care industry.</p>

                                <p>Blogger is slow right now, but it&#8217;s coming up.</p>
<p>&#8211; No <a href="http://salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/13/transmitter/index.html">bulge</a> immediately visible.</p>
<p>&#8211; Note to Kerry: lay off the ports and cargo holds. Good point, already been made. On the other hand, there might be a lot of viewers who haven&#8217;t seen the previous debates.</p>
<p>&#8211; When Bush says &#8220;spread liberty and freedom across the globe,&#8221; he somehow manages to make it sound like a plague.</p>
<p>&#8211; Bush laughing and smirking at Kerry because Kerry brought up Bush saying he wasn&#8217;t worried about OBL. Bush, apparently thinking it&#8217;s Campaign 2000, called it &#8220;one of those exaggerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/10/debate-thread-first_13.html">Atrios provides</a> the salient <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59518-2004Aug12.html?nav=rss_politics/a">Bush quote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So I don&#8217;t know where he is. You know, I just don&#8217;t spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you. . . . I truly am not that concerned about him.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Why is Bush&#8217;s face so red?</p>
<p>&#8211; More smirking; Bush thinks importing ceiling fans from China is funny.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Pay-Go&#8221;? Is that common phrasing in DC? I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not because Kerry was basically laughing as Bush said, and repeated, &#8220;Pay-Go&#8221; instead of &#8220;pay as you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Being lectured by the President on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order.&#8221; Came off flat. Note to Kerry: you won two debates without jokes. Keep it that way.</p>
<p>&#8211; More smirking, in response to Kerry talking about Boeing. Bush seems to fancy the word &#8220;litany&#8221; tonight.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry &#8220;voted to bust the budget&#8221; 277 times? What does that mean? Oh. He meant voting to increase the budget limit. Something that just became necessary under Bush about two weeks ago. See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/too-much-debt.html">this post from 10/5</a>:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/ap/20041005/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/debt_limit_2">W ASHINGTON</a> &#8211; The government should hit the national debt&#8217;s $7.4 trillion ceiling this month</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Kerry apparently isn&#8217;t in fact a Godless Liberal.</p>
<p>&#8211; A little fodder for the conspiracy theorists: Bush keeps looking down at his podium.</p>
<p>&#8211; Scheiffer: &#8220;&#8230;who bears responsibility for this [rising health care costs]? Is it the government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration?&#8221; Bush responds with a weird laughing. Heh, heh, heh, heh. &#8220;Gosh, I sure hope it isn&#8217;t the administration.&#8221; Then he says the problem is that consumers&#8217; insurance insulates them from the costs of their decisions, which has some truth to it. Then he gives spurious costs of lawsuits numbers, which isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>&#8211; The &#8220;height gap&#8221;. Freeze frame at 9:35. NBC has both Bush&#8217;s head even with Kerry&#8217;s, and the podiums are also even, unlike in the first debate. If you look closely, though, Bush&#8217;s head looks giant. NBC has zoomed in on Bush and used an angle to create the illusion of equal stature. This is similar to how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(movie)#Special_Effects">Gandalf was made to look so tall</a> while standing next to Frodo &#8212; though I&#8217;m not comparing Kerry to Frodo and certainly not Gandalf to Bush.</p>
<p>&#8211; Bush: &#8220;In all due respect, I&#8217;m not so sure it&#8217;s credible to quote leading news organizations about&#8230;aww nevermind. Anyway, uh.&#8221; This in response to Kerry citing two news networks calling Bush&#8217;s accusations vis a vis Kerry&#8217;s plan &#8220;misleading&#8221; and &#8220;untrue.&#8221; Speaking of untrue, Bush says Kerry is proposing the biggest expansion of government health care ever, which isn&#8217;t true &#8212; see the creation of Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8211; Good counter by Kerry: Bush&#8217;s not liking government involvement in health care must be why he&#8217;s not funding the VA. Bush disagrees and says he&#8217;s increased funding by $22 billion, twice the amount Clinton did. Over to Factcheck.org?</p>
<p>&#8211; Who, in 2000, does Bush recall saying that if he were elected, &#8220;Seniors would lose their social security checks?&#8221; It must have been someone at the gathering where <a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/topics/">Bush first gave his apocryphal &#8220;trifecta&#8221; line?</a></p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry: Bush&#8217;s privatization plan is &#8220;an invitation to disaster.&#8221; Kerry is citing the transition costs ($1 trillion minimum), not directly questioning whether it&#8217;s an otherwise reasonable program. But he did just say, &#8220;I will not privatize it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Blogger&#8217;s actin&#8217; up again.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry: &#8220;Eleven other presidents, 6 Democrats and 5 Republican, had wars, had recessions. Had great difficulties. None of them lost jobs the way this president has.&#8221; Ouch.</p>
<p>&#8211; Bush just said most of the benefits of the tax cuts went to the middle class. I suppose if the middle class is those between the 20th and 90th income percentiles, then that group <i>may</i> have gotten more than the top 10%. Though that&#8217;s probably not true if you factor in the estate tax repeal.</p>
<p>&#8211; Bush to Mexicans, &#8220;if you&#8217;re worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families&#8221; you are going to come here and work for $5.15/hour instead of 50 cents. Then he advocated temporary worker cards for foreign workers.</p>
<p>&#8211; Directly in response to a question about the minimum wage, Kerry says he&#8217;s for it; nice contrast between tax cuts for the wealthy instead of a higher minimum wage for workers. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don&#8217;t value families&#8221; &#8212; well delivered, too.</p>
<p>Bush: Quickly said he supported a Mitch McConnell act to raise the minimum wage. Then he said, &#8220;<em>the NCLB Act is really a jobs act, when you think about it</em>.&#8221; If you&#8217;re making the minimum wage, I understand that you can also feed the No Child Left Behind Act to your family.</p>
<p>&#8211; Question to Kerry: what would you do about the extended tours that &#8220;some&#8221; are calling a &#8220;backdoor draft.&#8221; Included among those &#8220;some&#8221;, is John Kerry, who specifically used the term and proposed adding 40k permanent troops and doubling the size of special forces. </p>
<p>Bush: Winning in Iraq will lower the burden on the troops. Then on to the &#8220;Global Test&#8221; line. I&#8217;m surprised Bush waited this long for this one. </p>
<p>&#8211; Bush just said &#8220;Republicans and Democrats were against the Assault Weapons Ban&#8221;, which is true in the sense that Republicans and Democrats are pro-choice because Snowe, Chaffee, and Collins are pro-choice.</p>
<p>&#8211; Bush loves praying, and loves that people around the country pray for him.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry&#8217;s quoting scripture and wants us to love our neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8211; There seems to be no question that Bush can&#8217;t answer by bringing up &#8220;No Child Left Behind.&#8221; I wonder if that&#8217;s one of <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">Wonkette&#8217;s</a> drinking phrases.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry cites McCain; Bush says &#8220;McCain is for me for president&#8221; and says Kerry has a &#8220;plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq,&#8221; which sounds the exact opposite of what Kerry actually says. </p>
<p>&#8211; Scheiffer cites them all having &#8220;strong wives&#8221; and asks what they learn from them. Bush: &#8220;To listen to them [laughter]. To stand up straight and not scowl [more laughter].&#8221; He should have stopped joking; his &#8220;she [Laura] speaks English better than me&#8221; follow-up fell flat, probably because the truth of it is scary.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kerry got laughter for saying &#8220;we all married up; some say me more than others.&#8221; And he loves his dear, departed, mother. And his daughters. So vote for him, dammit. [That last one was me talking, not Kerry.]</p>
<p>And now we close.</p>
<p>****************<br />
<br />Well, no more debates. Kerry looked good again, Bush was as good or a bit better than in debate 2. So it&#8217;s probably a small Kerry win to a draw. And I think that works out well for Kerry: people used to not like Kerry, but he came out likeable in Debate 1, and maintained that through all the debates. And he comes across smart, and committed to defense. </p>
<p>So I think the undecideds who say things like &#8220;I don&#8217;t like Bush, and his policies are all wrong, but I sure don&#8217;t like that John Kerry either&#8221; can be more at ease &#8212; or at least, less uneasy &#8212; with John Kerry. At no point in any of the debates did I see anything new that would similarly allay undecideds&#8217; fears about Bush. </p>
<p>I think this is exactly why the common wisdom is that undecideds tend to break towards the challenger: if they&#8217;re undecided, it would take something extraordinary to swing them to the incumbent, about whom the undecided voters have revealed, by virtue of being undecided, that they aren&#8217;t comfortable. On the other hand, undecideds likely know much less about the challenger, so relatively small favorable impressions are probably much more likely to swing votes towards the challenger. </p>
<p>God bless, and good night.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>UPDATE: Just saw the gang on MSNBC, and now Carl &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/politics/campaign/03fox.html?oref=login">Manicure</a>&#8221; Cameron on Fox. The right wingers are trying to make a big issue out of Kerry saying that Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter is a lesbian (Mrs. Cheney has apparently expressed displeasure; no statment yet from Cheney&#8217;s daughter, Mary.) </p>
<p>Then Cameron turned to the Bush OBL lie, played the debate clip (&#8220;that&#8217;s an exaggerration&#8221;), followed by a clip of Bush saying he&#8217;s truly not that concerned about him [OBL].&#8221; Cameron&#8217;s take: &#8220;Kerry campaign says they have a &#8216;gotcha&#8217; there.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now to editorialize on the Republicans trying to make an issue of Kerry&#8217;s lesbian reference: Kerry&#8217;s answer only insulted the Cheneys if you believe gays are immoral or inferior. Your protests are disingenuous at best; more likely, they reveal your dark hate. </p>
<p>UDPATE 2: Andrew Sullivan (who is gay, conservative, and until recently a solid Bush supporter): &#8220;Mary Cheney is out of the closet and a member, with her partner, of the vice-president&#8217;s family &#8230; [the outrage over the Mary Cheney mention is] entirely a function of people&#8217;s lingering prejudice against gay people &#8230; Bush has decided to use this cynically as a divisive weapon in an election campaign. He deserves to be held to account for this.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">notes</a> five whoppers Bush told in the second debate and hopes Kerry’s staff comes with some clever responses before tonight’s debates.  I’ll take a shot at whopper #2 as this one strikes me as really easy:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The deficit is solely the result of recession and war.</em> Flatly untrue. It&#8217;s also the result of tax cuts and spending increases. George Bush just doesn&#8217;t like to admit it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The deficit continues even as Bush himself has declared victory in the Afghan war and “Mission Accomplished” in Iraq.  Since Bush thinks the economy is doing great, why isn’t the budget back in surplus?  Open thread on the other four whoppers.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>If blogging existed during the Summer of ’72, I wonder if Watergate may have been more fully exposed in time for the Nixon v. McGovern election.  First of all, let me thank Kash for more fully explaining my first question when Chad rightfully noted that investors might purchase stock held by a family at a discounts.  Let me also note that the financial gimmicks of Andrew Fastow prove that corporate corruption can exist even without majority ownership as long as information asymmetries exist.  More on Fastow Finance and the emerging Sinclair scandal in a simple analogy later.  But first &#8211; many thanks to Rain Bo for noting <a href="http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=340">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jadoo Power Systems, Inc., a producer of portable power systems, announced September 28, that it had been awarded a contract to supply its products, which are used for covert surveillance operations, to US Special Operations Command. According to the SOCOM website, SOCOM “plans, directs, and executes special operations in the conduct of the War on Terrorism.” Jadoo, whose name in Hindi means “magic,” is owned by Sinclair Ventures, Inc. and Contango Capital Management. Sinclair Ventures is “a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. as well as other individuals.” A Jadoo press release reveals that in February, 2003, President Bush was personally briefed by the CEO of Jadoo, Larry Bawden, about Jadoo products. For the 2004 election, Sinclair executives have donated nearly $59,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign or the Republican National Committee (RNC), including a $50,000 gift to the RNC from Sinclair Vice President Fred Smith.</p></blockquote>
<p>I first read about how the Administration may have used taxpayer dollars to reward David and Fred Smith et al. from the now edited <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/10/follow-money.html">story</a> from Atrios.  Note Atrios at first thought that Jadoo was 100% owned by the 100% owned subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcasting, which would have undermined by implicit tie between question 1 and question 4 (question 4 being answered by Rain Bo’s link).  </p>
<p>But let me try an analogy as to how the Smiths might be profiting at the expense of minority shareholders and taxpayers alike even as they hurt Sinclair Broadcasting in their efforts to help Bush-Cheney.  Imagine a company called SB with two divisions: broadcasting and a Fastow Finance company that is the joint owner of JP.  SB is 100% owned by John Smith, while JP is 50% owned by SB and John Smith.  John Smith cuts a deal with a corrupt government that extracts $80 million from taxpayers towards JP, while it hurts SB to the tune of $100 million as the market makes SB pay for its brazen partisan smear attack on the political opponents of the corrupt government.  Do the math and SB’s net change in value equals 0.5(80) – 100 = negative $60 million.  While John Smith is out $36 million in SB value, the minority shareholders are out $24 million.  But John is also up $40 million as the outside shareholder of JP.  So on net he gains $4 million for his partisan assistance to the corrupt government.  Even though $100 million in value was destroyed, collectively the various investors are out only $20 million as taxpayers foot the remaining $80 million from the graft given to JP so John would do the dirty work for this corrupt government.</p>
<p>OK – this tale is in the speculation mode and it’s not a simple of an analogy, as I would have hoped.  But remember that the real world version of Fastow Finance (Enron) was very complex and yet our financial press eventually put out some very interesting discussions.  Also remember it took two years to unravel a simple burglary that turned out not to be so simple (Watergate) as President Nixon stonewalled this until after the election.  Let’s pray we get some smart and eager press folks to check out more of the Sinclair scandal in the next couple of weeks.   I’ll just say I’ve been impressed with what we’ve learned over just the past couple of days in the blogworld.  Now if the mainstream press would just pay attention.<br /></p>

                                <p>It seems that Republican political operatives have come to the conclusion that they can&#8217;t win this election on the issues.  So what can they do to try to win this election anyway?</p>
<p>Well, there are several options remaining.  First, you can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28123-2004Oct12.html">lie about your opponent</a>.  Second, you can use your control over the media to uneven the playing field in ways that <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_10.php#003649">abuse the public trust</a>.  Third, use petty theft to <a href="http://www.southknoxbubba.net/skblog/archive_2004_10.php#3581">restrict the free speech</a> of your opponents.  Fourth, you can try to make it harder for people who don&#8217;t vote Republican to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28107-2004Oct12.html">participate in the democratic process</a>.  If that doesn&#8217;t work, you can <a href="http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=2421595&#038;nav=168XRvNe">defraud Democrats outright</a> of their right to vote.  And of course, there&#8217;s always the option of <a href="http://www.aberdeennews.com/mld/aberdeennews/news/9895406.htm">generating illegal ballots</a> in your favor.</p>
<p>Note: If Democrats were doing any or all of these things, I&#8217;d be upset as well.  But (in this election cycle, at least) all of the illegal activities seem to be generated by Republicans, for some reason.  My conclusion is that it&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve ceded the issues to the Democrats, and therefore are concentrating their efforts on these less savory tactics.</p>
<p>So while Kerry is in <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2004/10/12/145553/03">pretty good shape</a> according to the polls, this election remains far from over.</p>

<p><a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> is having a lot of fun telling us about Sinclair Broadcasting and their CEO David Smith and points to <a href="http://cnnfn.investor.reuters.com/ReportDetails.aspx?sid=1&#038;ticker=SBGI.O&#038;ta%20get=%2F%2Fadvancedsearch&#038;docid=20582667">this</a> from CNNFN, which notes that its stock is rated F.</p>
<p>One might think the shareholders would be demanding a change in management.  But a review of the ownership of the stock suggests that this is not likely. Dyson Ehrhardt along with David, J. Duncan, Robert E., and Frederick Smith <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=SBGI">owns</a> over 42 million in common stock. The latest 10-Q for Sinclair Broadcasting shows 45.8 million in Class A common stock and 39.6 million in Class B common stock.  </p>
<p>Ehrhardt and the Smith family apparently control this company and are extracting its ability to generate shareholder income for their own “perquisite consumption” (see Bradford Cornell’s <em>Corporate Valuation</em>, page 244).  </p>
<p>I have four questions, which those who might have informed opinion are welcome to help me answer:</p>
<p>Q1: for the financial economists: why would anyone even invest in the shares of a company that is essentially controlled by a family?</p>
<p>Q2: for the securities attorneys: short of selling stock at this depressed price, what are the legal remedies of minority shareholders when the controlling interests extract value for their own perquisite consumption?</p>
<p>Q3: for the eager reporter types: is there other evidence that the Smiths are assisting rightwing Republicans such as Bush-Cheney?</p>
<p>Q4: for those who wish to speculate: are the majority owners of Sinclair Broadcasting going to receive some quid pro quo from the White House if Bush-Cheney are re-elected?</p>
<p>If the answer to my last question turns out to be yes, then this episode combines elements of Russia’s Yukos Oil scandal with good old fashion bribery.<br /></p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had intended to spend five weekly posts on the five chapters of the vacuous Agenda for America.  Your reaction to Chapters 1 and 4 was underwhelming, but then the chapters were virtually empty on how Bush-Cheney intends to promote either economic growth or national security.  So today, I’ll only briefly mention the other <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/Agenda">three chapters</a>.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is entitled “A Plan for Helping American Families in a Changing World”, which is their idea for health care reform.  Health Savings Accounts and Medical Liability “Reform” are the two big ideas.  Of course, their costly Prescription Drug Benefit will be implemented so taxpayers can pay for more Big Pharma profits.  The chapter does note some forecasts that employment might rise by an amount around 8.9 million, but the Agenda does not tell us what Bush-Cheney policies will be to insure these forecasts actually materialize for once.  While the chapter does say “the President proposes giving people the freedom to shop across state lines to find the best rates for their health coverage”, it does not mention allowing people to purchase drugs from Canada.  I guess his claim Friday night that he wants to make sure drugs from Canada were safe was not communicated to the author of this chapter.  </p>
<p>Chapter 3 is entitled “A Plan for Promoting An Era of Ownership”, which starts with ways households can increase their indebtedness by buying homes.  “Strengthening Social Security” is the code for partial privatization.  But with no cuts in benefits and no increases in payroll taxes, this section is silent on how the Social Security Trust Fund with be strengthened.  The rest of this chapter simply spins how gets the alleged tax cuts with no mention of who will pay down the massive debt created by Bush’s fiscal recklessness.  </p>
<p>Chapter 5 is entitled “A Plan for Supporting Our Communities and Honoring American Values of Compassion and Service”, which is code for a potpourri of rightwing ideas including promoting rightwing judges, reducing welfare benefits, and more faith-based initiatives.  One section is entitled “Improving the Environment”, which touts all the misleading labels used as Bush has undermined environmental efforts. “Promoting a Culture of Life” is code for the efforts to undermine a woman’s right to choose, while “Defending Marriage” is code for restricting the rights of homosexuals.  </p>
<p>Unless one is a rightwing nut, there is nothing of substance in Agenda for America.  Does this mean that a second term for Bush-Cheney will accomplish very little?  Or does it mean that what they intend to accomplish are things they do not wish to tell moderate Republicans and independent voters?<br /></p>
