                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Two things to note from this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/26/iraq.explosives/index.html"> CNN story</a>. One is how the GOP is trying to find almost any excuse for Bush’s incompetence as far as securing the HMX and RDX explosives:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in the wake of the NBC report, the Bush campaign fired off a statement saying that Kerry&#8217;s criticism of the president over the missing material has &#8220;been proven false before the day is over.&#8221; &#8220;John Kerry&#8217;s attacks today were baseless,&#8221; Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt said. &#8220;He said American troops did not secure the explosives, when the explosives were already missing.&#8221; Schmidt also said that Kerry &#8220;neglects to mention the 400,000 tons of weapons and explosives that are either destroyed or in the process of being destroyed&#8221; in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joe Lockhardt’s response is included and is spot on.  But has this story undermined the New York Times story in any way?  What is the new information?</p>
<blockquote><p>NBC News reported that on April 10, 2003, its crew was embedded with the U.S. Army&#8217;s 101st Airborne Division when troops arrived at the Al Qaqaa storage facility south of Baghdad. While the troops found large stockpiles of conventional explosives, they did not find HMX or RDX, the types of powerful explosives that reportedly went missing, according to NBC… Baghdad fell on April 9, 2003. According to NBC, troops from the 101st Airborne arrived the next day and could not the material.  At the Pentagon, officials said that the site had been repeatedly searched but the high explosives the IAEA described were never found.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Schmidt is confused as to where the blame lies.  The blame does not lie with the troops who did everything they could given their orders from the civilian commanders.  The blame goes to the lack of planning from Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld.  They are the ones who decided on when to invade.  They are the ones who decided not to send more forces.  They are the ones who put a priority of toppling the statute of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad over securing these weapon cites.  </p>
<p>And did not the IAEA know these explosive were there?  Did the Administration bother to consult with them?  Or did they only listen to Rumsfeld who pretended to know where all the dangerous weapons were?  </p>
<p>Why didn’t we simply bomb these facilities in March rather than waiting for the troops to reach Baghdad.  Oh wait, I’m assuming this war was about security rather than partisan politics and photo opportunities.  After all, had our bombers destroyed these explosives – they would not be very useful in Karl Rove’s war against American Democrats.  </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Josh Marshall</a> is suggesting CNN was duped into running this story by Drudge.  Even if this story were true, it speaks badly for the lack of planning by the Administration, but maybe this was another bit of Bush-Cheney dishonesty in a feeble attempt to cover-up their incompetence.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>The Bush administration intends to seek about $70 billion in emergency funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan early next year, pushing total war costs close to $225 billion since the invasion of Iraq early last year, Pentagon and congressional officials said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps now would be a good time to remind ourselves of the administration&#8217;s estimates (such as they were) of the cost of a US invasion of Iraq before the invasion was launched.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/consequences/2003/0228pentagoncontra.htm">Paul Wolfowitz</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>M. Wolfowitz dismissed articles in several newspapers this week asserting that Pentagon budget specialists put the cost of war and reconstruction at $60 billion to $95 billion in this fiscal year. He said it was impossible to predict accurately a war&#8217;s duration, its destruction and the extent of rebuilding afterward. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have no idea what we will need until we get there on the ground,&#8221; Mr. Wolfowitz said at a hearing of the House Budget Committee. &#8220;Every time we get a briefing on the war plan, it immediately goes down six different branches to see what the scenarios look like. If we costed each and every one, the costs would range from $10 billion to $100 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030218-4.html">Ari Fleisher</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/19/se.01.html">Donald Rumsfeld</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Well, the Office of Management and Budget has come up with a number that&#8217;s something under $50 billion for the cost. How much of that would be the U.S. burden and how much would be other countries is an open question.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/special/iraq/1842094">The OMB</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The White House projected Friday that postwar Iraq will not require long-term U.S. aid, in part because of oil reserves that the Bush administration contends will offset many of the costs of reconstruction. </p>
<p>&#8220;The United States is committed to helping Iraq recover from the conflict, but Iraq will not require sustained aid,&#8221; said a report from President Bush&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/01/sproject.irq.war.cost/">Mitch Daniels</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday that such a conflict could cost $50 billion to $60 billion &#8212; the price tag of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. </p>
<p>&#8230;In September, Daniels disputed an estimate by Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey &#8212; who has since left the White House &#8212; that war with Iraq could cost $200 billion. Daniels said he believes Lindsey&#8217;s estimate was &#8220;the upper end of a hypothetical,&#8221; Duffy said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Care to comment, Mr. Lindsey?  Mr. Daniels?</p>

<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (Reuters) &#8211; Wealthy Americans are becoming increasingly worried about the country&#8217;s economic outlook, and their reluctance to spend and invest is hurting growth, according to a survey released Monday. </p>
<p>As oil prices boil to new records and Iraq continues to appear unstable, McDonald Financial Group&#8217;s Affluent Consumer Confidence Index slid to 48 in the third quarter from 61 in the July poll. </p>
<p>More alarming, 42 percent of the people surveyed said the economy was headed in the wrong direction, almost double the number who thought so just three months ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it simply higher gas and heating oil prices that are worrying wealthy Americans?  Or do they see something else going on &#8212; like massive budget deficits as far as the eye can see, a lack of any remaining fiscal or monetary policy ammunition, a massive debt overhang for consumers, and a looming bubble in real estate markets?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>One of the most worrying aspects of the Bush administration has been its consistent push to increase the power and authority of the government.  This is particularly noticeable when juxtaposed to the administration&#8217;s moves to erode the ability of individuals to exercise their democratic rights to stand up against the government.</p>
<p>Note that while the Patriot Act is one example of these trends, at least that act was the product of the legislative process.  What concerns me much more (though I do hope that many of the PA’s elements will be ended or amended in coming years) are things that the Bush administration has done without any legislative (or, in many cases, judicial) approval.</p>
<p><strong>Government transparency: </strong><br />
<br />The Bush administration has taken to new heights the censoring of information that doesn&#8217;t fit well with state administration policies.  Whether it&#8217;s some inconvenient <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&#038;node=&#038;contentId=A9821-2003Dec17&#038;notFound=true">comments by administration officials</a>, information from the CDC website about <a href="http://irascibleprofessor.com/comments-10-08-02.htm">the use of condoms in preventing the spread of HIV</a>, the results of <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/edu/ed-info.htm">years of educational research</a> that inconveniently don&#8217;t fit with administration policies, the video of Bush saying that he is &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59555-2004Oct24.html">really not that concerned</a>&#8221; about OBL, or <a href="http://www.bradblog.com/archives/00000815.htm">a host of other things</a>, if it actually happened but doesn&#8217;t seem to square with the image that the Bush administration wants to project, then White House policy seems to be to delete the offending record. </p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that according to the Presidential Records act of 1978, all non-classified administration materials are supposed to be preserved and made public.  Which makes sense, since it&#8217;s through the administration&#8217;s public record that the government can most effectively be evaluated by its citizens.  As economist <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/002919.html">Brad DeLong says</a>, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stop calling the Bush administration &#8216;Orwellian&#8217; when they stop using <em>1984</em> as an operations manual.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the Bush administration has consistently tried to block any inquiry or investigation into its activities.  It resisted having an independent <a href="http://www.mikehersh.com/Bush_and_Cheney_Block_911_Investigation_.shtml">investigation of 9/11</a>, and then <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&#038;b=124722">obstructed it at every step</a>; turned down requests for an <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/gen/jan04/203405.asp">investigation of US intelligence failings</a>, and fought to keep its <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/cases/67/factsheet.htm">meeting with energy executives secret</a>, to name just a few cases.</p>
<p><strong>The Rule of Law: </strong><br />
<br />According to the Bush administration, it is now possible for the US government to imprison any US citizen, hold him completely incommunicado from family, friends, or even a lawyer, and keep him <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/08-21-03.html">imprisoned for months or years without ever filing charges</a>.   The fact that the US government feels that it can treat non-citizens this way is bad enough (of the several hundred prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/international/worldspecial2/24gitmo.html?oref=login&#038;hp&#038;ex=1098676800&#038;en=81aff6632e645e81&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">four have actually been charged</a> with a crime), but it’s far worse when a government thinks that it can treat its OWN citizens in such a manner, leaving its citizens with no power and no recourse to stand up to his own government.  The Supreme Court (eventually) reined in some of the Bush administration&#8217;s desires in this dimension, despite the administration&#8217;s bitter resistance, but that is obviously not something that Bush deserves any credit for.</p>
<p>But surely, supporters of the Bush administration argue, the government would only ever treat BAD citizens of the US that way, not GOOD citizens.  Surely the government would know the difference? </p>
<p>Apparently not.  When the Bush administration has been forced to either provide evidence of guilt or else release a detainee, it has often had to release the detainee because it couldn&#8217;t prove that the detainee had done anything wrong.  This has happened <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/09/tribunal_orders_that_guantanamo_detainee_be_freed/">to foreign detainees in Guantanamo</a> as well to <a href="http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3733942.stm">US citizens</a>.  If the men were guilty, presumably the government would have been able to provide some evidence of that guilt.  Instead, it simply imprisoned them for years, despite the lack of evidence against them.  In other words, the government held innocent American citizens in prison for years without allowing them their constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Add this to the Bush administration&#8217;s beliefs that it is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/politics/26detain.html?hp&#038;ex=1098849600&#038;en=625cd03fa770bac7&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">not bound by the Geneva Convention</a>, and we have a government that seems to believe that it does not need to adhere to international or domestic law.</p>
<p><strong>Restricting dissent:</strong><br />
<br />Finally, there are several ways in which Bush has tried to restrict the ability of individuals to criticize the government.  Some of these are rather juvenile limitations on the ability to express political opposition to the president, such as moving protesters <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/116477.html">out of earshot and eyesight of the president</a>.  Individuals still have the right to protest the president&#8217;s decisions, but they are forbidden from making their disagreement known to the president.   </p>
<p>During the campaign season it has also been the case that individuals who disagree with Bush may not even attend his campaign appearances – attendees must sign <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/08/09/bush_backers_only_policy_riles_voters_at_rnc_rallies/">loyalty oaths</a> or even write essays affirming their support of the president before they may hear him speak.  To me there seems to be something inherently undemocratic in forbidding undecided (or even unhappy) voters from hearing their president give a campaign speech.  But in Bush&#8217;s United States, you must have already decided that you are going to vote for Bush before you can hear him give a campaign speech.</p>
<p>Other attempts to stifle dissent are more ominous.  Most worrying to me is the way in which the <a href="http://sabarte.dailykos.com/story/2004/9/25/04843/5203">Bush administration</a> and <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2078455/">its allies</a> have <a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20030106.html">repeatedly</a> tried to equate criticism of the government with treason.  When it is no longer possible for citizens of the US to criticize their government, they will no longer be living in a fully-functioning democracy.  </p>
<p>When taken together, all of these details have noticeably shifted the balance of power between the government and individual citizens in favor of the government. That&#8217;s why Bush&#8217;s vision of democracy is not one in which I was brought up believing that the US enjoyed, and not one in which I wish to live.  And that&#8217;s yet another reason why I&#8217;m voting for John Kerry.</p>

The 8 are listed below but note that the story was comparing August 2004 to September 2004.  The report also notes that unemployment rose in 22 states during the month and fell in 23 states. One of the 8 states mentioned as seeing lower unemployment was Ohio, which AB discussed earlier today.  </p>
<p>Comparing the Sept. 2004 unemployment rate with the rate as of Dec. 2000 for each <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la+08">state</a>, we get:</p>
<p>Colorado: rose from 2.7% to 4.9%<br />
<br />Florida: rose from 3.6% to 4.5%<br />
<br />Minnesota: rose from 3.4% to 4.6%<br />
<br />Nevada: fell from 4.4% to 3.9%<br />
<br />New Hampshire: rose from 4.7% to 5.3%<br />
<br />New Mexico: rose from 4.7% to 5.3%<br />
<br />Ohio: rose from 3.9% to 6.0%<br />
<br />Pennsylvania: rose from 4.2% to 5.3%</p>
<p>Maybe those in the casino sector are better off than they were four years ago, but most voters know the economy is worse off than it was when Bush took office – even if Bush and the press make silly claims to the contrary.</p>

                                <p>We just learned about the missing 380 tons of explosives from the New York Times even though the Administration has known about this for some time.  The Times had to learn from the Iraqis as the Administration apparently wanted to keep the lid on this until after November 2.  And the Administration’s prime concern seems to be its political as its cheerleaders are downplaying the significance of this missing explosive.</p>
<p>Time Magazine has <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101041101-733760,00.html">this story</a> about Bunny Greenhouse, the “whistle-blower objected to the government&#8217;s Halliburton deals—and says now she&#8217;s paying for it”.  Halliburton scoffs this is old news.  Of course, we are talking about a <em>five-year </em>no-bid contract sold on the premise that time was of the urgency even though this was a month before the decision to go to war.  Weren’t we told that Bush was hoping not to invade on March 19, 2003?  And why is the Administration going after Ms. Greenhouse?  </p>
<p>Of course, these two examples of corruption and incompetence are only the latest in a long line of stories that the Administration is trying to cover-up. A few of the others include:</p>
<p>PlameGate<br />
<br />Abu Ghraib<br />
<br />Those Cheney meeting with energy executive in early 2001<br />
<br />The true cost of the prescription drug benefit and the possibility that most of the benefits will accrue to big pharma<br />
<br />Bush’s Social Security agenda<br />
<br />Which taxpayers will pay for the Bush increases in government spending<br />
<br />The debt ceiling being delayed again until after November 2</p>
<p>This White House seems less concerned with its corruption and incompetence and more concerned with suppressing the truth until after next week’s election.  Maybe some savvy day-trader should research who sells shredding machines because if Kerry wins the election, we might have an Andersen-Enron shredding party on a massive scale.<br /></p>

And awfully, awfully bad, for all of us &#8212; but especially for our soldiers in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 24 &#8211; The Iraqi interim government has warned the United States and international nuclear inspectors that nearly 380 tons of powerful conventional explosives &#8211; used to demolish buildings, make missile warheads and detonate nuclear weapons &#8211; are missing from one of Iraq&#8217;s most sensitive former military installations.</p>
<p>The huge facility, called Al Qaqaa, was supposed to be under American military control but is now a no man&#8217;s land, still picked over by looters as recently as Sunday. United Nations weapons inspectors had monitored the explosives for many years, but White House and Pentagon officials acknowledge that the explosives vanished sometime after the American-led invasion last year.</p>
<p>&#8230;The International Atomic Energy Agency publicly warned about the danger of these explosives before the war, and <strong>after the invasion it specifically told United States officials about the need to keep the explosives secured</strong>, European diplomats said in interviews last week. Administration officials say they cannot explain why the explosives were not safeguarded, beyond the fact that the occupation force was overwhelmed by the amount of munitions they found throughout the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>These explosives are now killing dozens or scores of Iraqis and Americans in Iraq every week, and may be valuable on the black market to parties interested in developing nuclear weapons.  <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_24.php#003780">Josh Marshall</a> has more sordid details and depressing implications of this story, including how the US pressured the Iraqis to violate IAEA rules and <em><strong>not report</strong></em> the theft of this dangerous material.  </p>
<p>I am flabbergasted.  I goggle.  I am in awe. I can not overstate how much spectacular incompetence it must have taken to let this happen.</p>
<p>Someone should lose their job over this.  Since Bush seems incapable of holding any of his people accountable for their mistakes, I suggest making it Bush himself.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>According to conservative wheeler-dealer Grover Norquist, if Bush is re-elected, &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.norquist.html">the Democratic party is toast</a>.&#8221;  There are two prongs to his plan to keep the Republicans in power.</p>
<p>The first is to &#8220;defund the left,&#8221; which includes relatively well-known proposals like tort reform to get rid of the trial lawyers and contracting out government jobs to get rid of public employee unions. It also means less publicized plans like putting restrictions on <a href="http://www.atr.org/policybriefs/021802pb-es.html">labor unions</a> and <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=2055">citizens groups</a> like the AARP and Planned Parenthood to keep them from engaging in politics.</p>
<p>I find this pretty convincing. Norquist has thought hard about how to hurt the groups that make up the Democratic party&#8217;s coalition, and his ideas are likely be effective. I&#8217;m not sure whether to be disgusted at the crassness of it all, or jealous that liberals don&#8217;t seem to think in these terms.</p>
<p>The second prong is to increase &#8220;ownership,&#8221; especially stock ownership:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>It made sense that if more Americans owned shares of stock , then more Americans would share the interests of the investor class: a desire for low taxes on capital, support for free trade, opposition to bigger government and that this would translate into <a href="http://www.americanshareholders.com/commentary/children.php">greater support for the Republican party</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p> This was <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2105743/">debunked</a> pretty well by Daniel Gross in Slate. His strongest point is that while the percentage of Americans owning some stock more than doubled since 1990, there has been little movement towards the Republicans.</p>
<p>And the research Norquist likes to cite to back it up is <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-359es.html">pretty unimpressive</a>. Apparently, stockowners earning $20,000 or more likely to support cutting the capital gains tax than low-earners with no stock , to take one example. But only by 52%-40%. And this without controlling for anything else. People with low earnings one year may well expect to have higher earnings the next year (wealthy college students, for example).</p>
<p>Even if Norquist is wrong and stock ownership doesn&#8217;t make people more conservative (and I&#8217;d really like to see some good research on the question) subordinating policy to some imagined long-run political impacts doesn&#8217;t seem like such a good idea.<br /></p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=178949">ABC reported on Tuesday</a> that Kerry is ahead of Bush by 50-47, the race remains exceptionally tight. Real Clear Politics, which tracks polls state by state, shows that when the seven Ohio polls taken from 10/14-10/21 are averaged <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/bush_vs_kerry_sbys.html">the result is an exact tie</a>, 47.4% to 47.4%.</p>
<p>Certainly, some portion of Ohio voters are solidly in Bush&#8217;s base and will cast their votes for him regardless of the merits of any <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?oref=login&#038;oref=login&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&#038;position">reality-based</a> arguments (in many cases, for <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/18/gayohio/index.html">the worst of reasons</a>.) But my guess is that that is at most 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the Ohio electorate, meaning that in addition to the undecided 5%, approximately 1 in 4 of those currently supporting Bush might listen to reason. So here goes nothing.</p>
<p>Economic life under Bush II has been pretty tough. This is true in America in general, but is particularly true in Ohio. Some but not all of the Ohio&#8217;s problems are the direct result of Bush&#8217;s steel tariffs, an <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/pa_polls.html">apparently fruitless attempt</a> to win votes in Pennsylvania (a state he lost in 2000) on the backs of Ohioans (who supported Bush by 3.5 points in 2000.) What happens in Ohio, a state that specializes in making and selling stuff, when Bush&#8217;s tariffs <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3MKT/is_2003_June_20/ai_104031942">increase the cost of making stuff</a>? Less goods are manufactured and sold, and the people who otherwise would have made said goods lose their jobs. In fact, the Buckeye state is down about 175,000 manufacturing jobs since Bush took office:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/OhioManufJobs.gif"></center><br />
<br />But surely that decline is offset by a tax-cut induced boom in other sectors? Sadly, no:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/OhioNonFarm.gif"></center><br />
<br />Overall, Ohio has lost about 200,000 jobs since Bush took office, so the state has to lose about 25,000 non-manufacturing jobs as well.</p>
<p>But surely this is due to people leaving the state? Perhaps some other decline in Ohio&#8217;s working age population? <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/SC-EST2003-02.html">No</a>.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/OhioPop.gif"></center><br />
<br />I&#8217;ll repeat this yet again: it&#8217;s not fair or accurate to lay responsibility for the onset of job losses in Ohio on President Bush. But much of the blame for failing to staunch the bleeding does in fact lie with the president. And the blame for actively exacerbating the bleeding with a steel-tariff shiv lies completely with the president.</p>
<p>Remember, as the <a href="http://www.ohiogop.org/Welcome.aspx">Ohio GOP points out</a>, &#8220;No Republican has ever been elected president without carrying Ohio.&#8221; If you know anyone in Ohio, you might ask them to seriously consider whether they want four more years like last the four, and strongly encourage them to vote accordingly.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>UPDATE: Even as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57458-2004Oct23.html">Washington Post reports</a> that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>A poll by Ohio University&#8217;s Scripps Survey Research Center, completed Thursday night, found Kerry leading 49 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, with a margin of error of five percentage points,</p></blockquote>
<p>the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/23/politics/campaign/23vote.html?ex=1256184000&amp;en=649b5c012f3d326b&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland">NYT reports</a> that<br />
<blockquote>Republican Party officials in Ohio took formal steps yesterday to place thousands of recruits inside polling places on Election Day to challenge the qualifications of voters they suspect are not eligible to cast ballots.</p>
<p>&#8230;Ohio election officials said they had never seen so large a drive to prepare for Election Day challenges. They said they were scrambling yesterday to be ready for disruptions in the voting process as well as alarm and complaints among voters. &#8230; they worried that the challenges could discourage or even frighten others waiting to vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, even if it looks like Kerry&#8217;s got Ohio in the bag, it will still probably be down to the wire. Vote.</p>

                                <p>The Bush campaign is releasing a new ad entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/News/MultiMedia/Player.aspx?ID=1102&#038;T=5&#038;PT=">Wolves</a>&#8220;, that explicitly plays the fear card.  Its intent is to generate a mood of danger, and then claim that Kerry would not be a good protector of the US.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001101.html">Some</a> are already thinking that it will be an effective and memorable ad, though I&#8217;m not convinced about that.  The interesting question, to me, is how the Kerry campaign should respond.  Do they mention that Cheney wanted to cut funding for intelligence and defense in the early 1990s?  Do they point out that Bush had read a memo titled &#8220;Bin Laden Determined to Attack US&#8221; at the start of his August vacation, and then proceeded to spend four weeks clearing brush from his ranch?  Is it time to use some excerpts from Richard Clarke&#8217;s book?  Or should they simply start quoting the numerous <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/07/system-was-blinking-red-after-spending.html">passages from the 9/11 commission report</a> that indicate that the Bush administration responded woefully inadequately to the looming threat of terrorism in 2001?</p>
