                                <p>No problem. Just <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/ap/20041005/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/debt_limit_2">raise your credit limit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; The government should hit the national debt&#8217;s $7.4 trillion ceiling this month, and the Bush administration told Congress again Monday it should raise the limit. That would be a politically sticky move just weeks from the Nov. 2 elections.</p>
<p>Treasury Department (news &#8211; web sites) spokesman Rob Nichols said the government is on track to reach the limit in early October. He could not provide a more specific date but said the forecast is made &#8220;on a day-to-day basis,&#8221; and Congress would be notified.</p>
<p>&#8230; The government&#8217;s debt was $7.364 trillion as of Friday, $18.3 billion from the ceiling. Congress last boosted the limit in May 2003. </p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst all the election goings on, I almost missed this. Thanks to reader MF for the tip. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little hard to wrap your head around a number like $8 trillion. Just remember that your share is about $28,000. And counting. </p>

                                <p>&#8211; Hmm. They just shook hands on camera; I read they weren&#8217;t going to do that.</p>
<p>&#8211; FYI, Here&#8217;s Condoleeza Rice <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh081103.shtml">talking about tonight&#8217;s moderator</a>, Gwen Ifill:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>RICE: Thank you very much. I’d like to thank Gwen for that wonderful<br />
<br />introduction. And even if you aren’t getting invited, I can tell you that she is, in fact, an excellent cook. I’ve been able to partake of that since I’ve been in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Cheney: I&#8217;d do it [Iraq] all over again.</p>
<p>Edward&#8217;s first line: &#8220;Mr. Vice President, you still are not being straight with the American people.&#8221; Then some evidence and examples. Aggressive start, this should be good. Cite Dick Lugar (R-IN).</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards: &#8220;MR. VP., there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein.&#8221; Cite 9/11 commission, cite Powell. Basically said Cheney is wandering the country lying. Then cite Rummy yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards just confused OBL and SH (something for which Bush caught some flack).</p>
<p>&#8211; Whoa! Cheney: &#8220;I have not suggested there&#8217;s a connection between Iraq and the 9/11.&#8221; Start your Lexis/Nexis engines!</p>
<p>&#8211; Blogger is <i>really</i> slow right now. In the meantime, amuse yourself by watching for Cheney to say they took down the AQ Kahn network.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards: &#8220;Someone did get it wrong, but it wasn&#8217;t John Kerry and John Edwards. They got it wrong.&#8221; (Letting OBL escape in Afghanistan). Also gave a good accounting of Kerry&#8217;s &#8220;global test&#8221; line. Followed by an accounting of the continuing problems in Afghanistan. Cheney responds by talking about El Salvador and the human drive for freedom.</p>
<p>&#8211; Ifill: What is a &#8220;global test&#8221; if not a global veto? Edwards: &#8220;He also said no veto&#8221; then explains that this means, basically, tell the truth. In fact, Edward&#8217;s is at least echoing <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/election_2004_/2004/10/the_kerry_doctrine.php">Mark Kleiman&#8217;s proposed Kerry Doctrine</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Defend the country. Promote freedom. Pay attention to the facts. Listen to the experts. Make sure your buddies have your back. Plan for victory. Tell the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Cheney responds: We&#8217;re not paying 90% of the costs, it&#8217;s more like 50% (because of all the Iraqi&#8217;s in security jobs who are dying). But query: can citizens of a country be a member of the coalition that is invading that country. It&#8217;s getting ugly right now. Cheney says Edwards is &#8220;just wrong&#8221;, &#8220;probably wasn&#8217;t there&#8221; for a vote, not consistent&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Objectively, Cheney is acquitting himself well. So is Edwards. Looks like it&#8217;s going to be a draw. Since Bush got smashed last week, a draw tonight will likely be spun as a big victory for BC04.</p>
<p>&#8211; Novel Edwards proposal: Taking Iraqis out of Iraq.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards: &#8220;They sent 40k troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed &#8230; the height of hypocrisy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheney: &#8220;Hard to know where to start, there&#8217;s so many inaccuracies. The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn&#8217;t have what they have today if you guys had had your way.&#8221; He also made the silly claim that the Gulf War II coalition is just as strong as that from GWI because they contain the same number of countries.</p>
<p>Edwards: regardless of what the VP says, we&#8217;re at $200b and counting (GWI was $5b) and bearing 90% of the casualties. DC says JE is demeaning dead Iraqis by saying we&#8217;re bearing 90% of the casualties. I&#8217;d say that citizens of country X, by definition, can&#8217;t really be part of the invasion to liberate themselves.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cheney is harping on Zarqawi. Will Edwards bring up Zarqawi being let go before the war, or would that be too tinfoil-hat like?</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards: &#8220;There are 60 countries with members of al Qaeda in them. How many of them are we going to invade?&#8221; On Iran sanctions, Edwards just mentioned Halliburton doing business with Iran and Libya under Cheney, as well as no bid contracts. Cheney says it would take more than 30 seconds to respond and sends viewers to &#8220;factcheck.com&#8221; for the facts on Halliburton. (I believe the VP means factcheck.org.)</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Senator, frankly you have a record in the Senate that&#8217;s not very distinguished&#8230;missed 33/36 Judiciary Committee meetings, almost 70% of Intelligence Committee meetings&#8230;lot of key votes.&#8221; Edwards: &#8220;That was a complete distortion of my record&#8221; Mentions Cheney being against HeadStart, DOE, Meals on Wheels for Seniors, MLK day, against a resolution calling for Nelson Mandela&#8217;s release&#8230;&#8221;it&#8217;s amazing to hear him criticize either my record or John Kerry&#8217;s.&#8221; Nice answer.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cheney just said that he believes Saddam being out of power has reduced the number of suicide bombings in Israel.</p>
<p>&#8211; Now on to the Domestic debate.</p>
<p>&#8211; In his first answer, Cheney brought up, among many other things, &#8220;litigation costs&#8221; &#8212; perhaps foreshadowing an upcoming attack? But Cheney&#8217;s emphasizing NCLB. (though, as Edwards pointed out, the question was actually about *Jobs*). NCLB has, I think, mixed results. But it&#8217;s easy to see why Cheney would rather talk about NCLB than about jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Mr. Vice President, I don&#8217;t think the country can take four more years of this [bad economy].&#8221; Delivery was a bit flat, though.</p>
<p>&#8211; Now on to the Domestic debate.</p>
<p>&#8211; In his first answer, Cheney brought up, among many other things, &#8220;litigation costs&#8221; &#8212; perhaps foreshadowing an upcoming attack? But Cheney&#8217;s emphasizing NCLB (though, as Edwards pointed out, the question was actually about *Jobs*). NCLB has, I think, mixed results. But it&#8217;s fairly easy to see why Cheney would rather talk about NCLB than about jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Mr. Vice President, I don&#8217;t think the country can take four more years of this [bad economy].&#8221; Delivery was a bit flat, though.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sheesh. Even Edwards uses the &#8220;tax relief&#8221; phrase. Will he cite the &#8220;death tax&#8221; next? Cheney just said Kerry voted for tax increases 98 times? I thought it was 300? Is Cheney flip-flopping on how aggressively John Kerry raises taxes?</p>
<p>&#8211; Cheney asked about same-sex marriage. Says it should be up to the states, but the president makes the policy and he supports him.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cheney passes on the chance to directly attack Edwards for having been a trial lawyer (says he doesn’t know about Edwards cases), but waxes on about the need for tort reform. Edwards replies with a proposal for a review panel (to keep frivolous cases out of the courts) and his story of Valerie Lakey. Points out that lawsuit-related costs account for about ½ of one percent of health care costs.</p>
<p>&#8211; Ifill asks Edwards&#8217; about his lack of experience. Edwards: Americans want to know three things about their VP and President: keep them safe, good judgement, and telling the truth. Basically says he has fits the bill and that, while he lacks Cheney&#8217;s long resume, a long resume doesn&#8217;t imply good judgement.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edwards really isn&#8217;t doing particularly well (not terribly, either), and he seems to know it. I&#8217;ve had this happen when I&#8217;m teaching: my rhythm gets off, then I can sense that I&#8217;m losing the room, keeping my rhythm off, and so on. It&#8217;s hard to break out of, even when the material is good.</p>
<p>&#8211; Ifill to Edwards: &#8220;You just used John Kerry&#8217;s name [which her question had asked him not to do.&#8221; I believe she&#8217;s about to pull out a bottle of Rum 151 and make him do a shot. He just said &#8220;Kerry&#8221; again. That&#8217;s two shots.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cheney just brought out the $87 billion, again. Will somebody please point out that President Bush threatened, more than once, to veto that $87 billion? And Bush rarely issues veto threats, so Bush must have been <em>really </em>opposed to funding the troops.</p>
<p>&#8211; Is it true that 1/2 of African-Americans and Hispanics drop out of high school, as Edwards just said?</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Well, that was boring. Right now, I&#8217;m yearning for Bush&#8217;s blinking and scowling. To reiterate, I don&#8217;t think Edwards did badly, just that he came off flat, particularly compared to expectations. Cheney didn&#8217;t do well spectacularly well, either. But he didn&#8217;t have his typical hard edge, or at least it wasn&#8217;t showing. So from an objective point of view, the debate was close to a tie. Which I suspect the late night yammerers will declare a BC04 victory.</p>
<p>Of course, VP debates don&#8217;t really matter. Lloyd Bentson destroyed Dan Quayle, and we know how that worked out for Dukakis. Cheney beat Lieberman in 2000, too, yet Gore won under most non-Supreme Court metrics.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>UPDATE: Scanning the coverage, and seeing <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000322.html">these numbers</a> at Brad&#8217;s blog, it looks like the lefty bloggers &#8212; and much more importantly, debate viewers in general &#8212; liked Edwards a lot more than I did. Kevin Drum initially had a <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004850.php">reaction similar to mine</a>, which after reflection he somewhat <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004851.php">revised in Edwards&#8217; favor</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>You know, after taking the time to write all this stuff down, I&#8217;m beginning to think Edwards did better than I initially gave him credit for. Basically, he put Cheney on the defensive on Iraq and demonstrated clear superiority on domestic issues. That&#8217;s not bad.</p>
<p>So score it a modest victory for Edwards, especially since he was the one who had to prove he could hold his own. </p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll also have to change my mind. I do think it was telling that Cheney rarely mentioned Bush by name whereas Edwards, literally at times, could not stop mentioning Kerry&#8217;s name.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I’ll be interested in whether Dick Cheney tries to claim real wages are rising again.  It is true that the BLS reporting of nominal average hourly earnings is 7% higher than it was as of December 2001, but so is its reporting of consumer prices.  We have seen lots of confusion on this score including some conservatives criticizing New York Times writings for reporting real income changes.  The oddest seems to be <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/letters/letters200410040854.asp">this</a> from Donald Luskin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be that as it may, there is no unique virtue to inflation-adjusting — except that it makes all changes in income look worse, which well serves the liberal agenda of the Times’s economic reporting during an election year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As he often does, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000307.html">Brad DeLong</a> get the economics right.  To show that this no inflation adjustment idea is a fair and balanced absurdity, <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew">Matthew Yglesias</a> applies to nominal GDP growth under President Carter.  Of course, the early 1920’s in Germany were truly the “boom years” as noted by <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that inflation has exceeded the growth in nominal income for most households serves the agenda of the Bush apologists.  Let’s see if Dick Cheney continues his lies on the economy tonight.  But I guess the real contest is to see whether he lies about the economy or about national security more.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Since the first Presidential debate covered the national security issue, my review of Bush’s Agenda for America will address <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/Agenda/Chapter.aspx?ID=4">chapter 4</a>. The short version of this is “The Best Defense is a Good Offense”.  I can see why the authors put the plans for strengthening homeland security towards the end of this document given that President Bush has shortchanged these efforts being more concerned about the “tax gap”.  The “Improving Intelligence” is also incredibly brief, but one has to wonder whether this Administration values intelligence or just spin for partisan agendas.  So let’s focus as this chapter does on fighting the terrorists abroad.  </p>
<p>The introduction suggests that America will not wait for new threats to grow and fester and that we must “change the conditions of hopelessness and resentment that provide fertile ground for terrorist recruitment”.  The list of accomplishments include “the terrorist camps in Afghanistan have been destroyed” and “an interim government is leading the Iraqi people to freedom”.  But the reality is that Al Qaeda and the Taliban still roam in Afghanistan and have found new recruits elsewhere around the world, while Iraq is currently a mess.  </p>
<p>A short section called “Combating Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction” advocates a missile defense system (as if the Soviets were still pointing ICBMs at us) and brags about dismantling the A. Q. Khan secret nuclear proliferation network.  OK, dismantling his network may be more important that arresting Khan (which we have not) but it turns out that both Iran and North Korea have already advance their nuclear weapons programs as we do nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, one can argue that we cannot do much about these other members of Bush’s “axis of evil” as we have become bogged down in the Iraqi quagmire even though Saddam Hussein did not have a nuclear weapons program or biological/chemical WMDs.  And this preemptive war with the badly run reconstruction has increased the “hopelessness and resentment that provide fertile ground for terrorist recruitment”.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by saying we will promote freedom and progress abroad with certain vague statements as how this will be done.  One claim is that President Bush will expand the “benefits of the global economy” by promoting a trade agenda that spreads prosperity to poor countries, which I find very odd given some of the recent moves towards trade protection by this White House have limited the exports from certain poor nations.  But the oddest feature of this chapter is the complete lack of any mention of resolving the Israeli-Palestine conflict.  But then again, the Bush Administration has scuttled entirely the hard work of the former Administration in this regard, so how can they mention this issue?  </p>
<p>Let me suggest two propositions – the first of which the Neocons will likely accept.  The first proposition is that the four essentials of the Al Qaeda food group are chaos, death, hatred towards the United States, and a lack of cooperation among the nations that supposedly value peace.  The second proposition is that this Neocon approach of attacking Iraq has given large helpings of each of these four food groups to Osama bin Laden – who is oddly not even mentioned in “Defending American Lives &#038; Liberty”.  </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>CNN is running a story where the CBO&#8217;s forecast of the 5-year cost of the House Intel reform bill is $15 billion.  Speaker Hastert asks: &#8220;What does it cost us to have a 9/11 event? What would it cost us to have another 9/11 event?&#8221;.  I guess he did not get Bush&#8217;s tax gap memo.</p>

                                <p>Earnings season is getting under way on Wall Street.  Over the next few weeks most of the US&#8217;s big corporations will be reporting their third quarter profits.</p>
<p>Over recent weeks, investors have <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ibd/040922/feature_1.html">become pessimistic</a> on the outlook for corporate profits to keep rising.  By a two-to-one ratio companies are warning investors that their profits will fall below earlier expectations, and estimates of overall profit growth for S&#038;P companies has been lowered repeatedly.</p>
<p>The national accounts data suggest that such caution may be warranted.  The following graph shows corporate profits since 2000 (at annualized rates).  The dark line shows a measure of &#8220;real&#8221; profits, while the light line shows the profits that companies can legally report on their tax statements.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/corp_profits.jpg"></p>
<p>The sizeable difference between the two lines is the result of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which allowed companies to report far lower profits than they actually earned.  But the suspicious thing about the graph is that it shows that by the second quarter of this year, profit growth had already slowed to a virtual halt.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen, and something that we&#8217;ll get some clues about over the coming weeks, is whether this is just a pause in profit growth, or a sign that companies have already seen the peak of their profits.  Given the recent <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/august-personal-income.html">sluggish growth in income</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/oil-prices.html">higher oil prices</a>, and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/disinflation-watch.html">lack of pricing power</a> for firms, I will not be at all surprised if it&#8217;s the latter.</p>

<p>Such a comparison is obvious, but nevertheless worth making.  So was he incompetent, or simply lying last year?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve come across a one-stop shop for proving the falsity of the claims of the Bush campaign: the George Bush re-election website!</p>
<p>Today the Bush campaign released a new ad attacking Kerry. The web page that supposedly provides the &#8220;<a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/KerryMediaCenter/Read.aspx?ID=3741">Ad facts</a>&#8221; describes the opening of the ad:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mom Voiceover:<br />
<br />5:30, I need to get groceries&#8230;. I&#8217;m gonna be late.</p>
<p>Radio Voiceover:<br />
<br />John Kerry and the liberals in Congress have voted to raise gas taxes 10 times.</p>
<p>Mom Voiceover:<br />
<br />10 times&#8230; gas prices are high enough already.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, they conveniently provide the documentary evidence that their claim that &#8220;Kerry&#8230; voted to raise gas taxes 10 times&#8221; is patently untrue. Of the 10 votes they cite, at least 2 are the result of their double-counting single bills, and 6 more are the result of counting votes against cutting the tax on gas. </p>
<p>Now this may be a subtle point of logic, but I think it&#8217;s still a distinction worth maintaining: <em>holding something constant is not the same as raising it</em>.  By similar reasoning and for future reference, perhaps we should point out that reducing something is not the same as keeping it constant, and raising something is actually different (in a subtle sort of way) from reducing it.</p>
<p>Sadly, the only surprising thing about this is that the Bush campaign website feels that they can provide the evidence for their lies without even trying to hide it.</p>

                                <p>Why is it so difficult for Condoleezza Rice to tell the truth? The story in the <em>New York Times</em> yesterday in many ways recounted what we learned in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A36348-2002Sep18?language=printer">this story</a> from two years ago: </p>
<blockquote><p>Evidence on Iraq Challenged: Experts Question if Tubes Were Meant for Weapons Program by Joby Warrick, Thursday, September 19, 2002…There is no evidence that any of the tubes reached Iraq. But in its white paper on Iraq released to the United Nations last week, the Bush administration cited the seized shipments as evidence that Iraq is actively seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Bush&#8217;s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said in a televised interview that the tubes &#8220;are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs.&#8221; Since then, U.S. officials have acknowledged differing opinions within the U.S. intelligence community about possible uses for the tubes &#8211; with some experts contending that a more plausible explanation was that the aluminum was meant to build launch tubes for Iraq&#8217;s artillery rockets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dick Cheney definitively declares Iraq had an active nuclear program citing these tubes as irrefutable evidence – even though he knew at the time there was not an active nuclear program and even if there were, Iraq was years away from being able to make a nuclear bomb.  Dr. Rice on one hand said she had no information that these tubes might be for different purposes untial after she declear their only potential use was for nuclear weapons, but she also says she was vaguely away of some debate.  But her staff knew the doubts that these tubes were for a nuclear weapons program.  Is Dr. Rice so derelict in her duties that she does not consult with her own staff before making such statements?</p>
<p>Rice appeared on ABC’s <em>This Week </em>as well as on CNN’s <em>Late Edition</em>. ABC <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Politics/ap20041003_384.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Sunday, Rice acknowledged she was aware of a debate among U.S. intelligence agencies about whether those tubes were intended for nuclear weapons…&#8221;The intelligence community assessment as a whole was that these (tubes) were likely and certainly suitable for, and likely for, his nuclear weapons program,&#8221; Rice told ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week&#8221;.. But two years later, Rice insisted she has no regrets about how the administration portrayed what it believed was a dangerous threat posed by Saddam. &#8220;I stand by to this day the correctness of the decision to take seriously an intelligence assessment that Saddam Hussein would likely have a nuclear weapon&#8221; if action wasn&#8217;t taken…A New York Times story Sunday quoted four CIA officials and a senior administration official as saying that Rice and her staff had been told in 2001 that Energy Department experts believed the tubes were probably intended for small artillery rockets and not nuclear weapons. Rice said she learned of objections by the Energy Department only after making her 2002 comments.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/03/rice.bush.kerry/index.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>New York Times report Sunday cited Rice&#8217;s comments and quoted CIA and administration officials as saying that Department of Energy experts told her staff almost a year before &#8211; in 2001 &#8211; that they thought the tubes were for artillery rockets, not for creating nuclear weapons. Rice said she was vaguely aware of a debate about the tubes but believed that the intelligence community &#8220;as a whole&#8221; agreed they were meant for nuclear weapons work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it so hard for these two networks to put this plainly as in: “Dr. Rice excused her past lies by offerring more lies”.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>A record surge of potential new voters has swamped boards of election from Pennsylvania to Oregon, as the biggest of the crucial swing states reach registration deadlines today. Elections officials have had to add staff and equipment, push well beyond budgets and work around the clock to process the registrations.</p>
<p>&#8230; Today is the deadline for registering new voters in Pennsylvania, as well as Ohio, Michigan, Florida and 12 other states, and election workers will go on mandatory overtime to chip away at the thousands of forms that have been arriving daily.<br />
</p>
<p>&#8230; Registration numbers are impossible to tally nationwide, and how many of the newly registered will vote is a matter of some debate. But it is clear the pace is particularly high in urban areas of swing states, where independent Democratic groups and community organizations have been running a huge voter registration campaign for just over a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Still, filling out a card is relatively costless, while voting actually takes some time, so it&#8217;s far from certain that these newly-registered voters will actually show up on election day. If you happen to live in PA, OH, MI, FL, or for that matter, any other swing state and you have not yet registered yourself and all your friends, today is probably your last chance. Get to it!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In 2000, Bush fooled a lot of people into thinking he was a moderate, or at least a &#8220;compassionate conservative.&#8221; Presumably he won&#8217;t be able to do it again, but the amazing thing is that he&#8217;s trying.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.debates.org/pages/debtrans.html">2000 debates</a>, Bush at times criticized Gore from the left: &#8220;These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it.&#8221; Bush made a number of proposals on health care, but kept his promise (more or less) on only one: a prescription drug plan for seniors, which is supposed to go into effect in 2006.</p>
<p>His broken promises include: quick passage of prescription drug plan for low-income seniors, a patients&#8217; bill of rights, &#8220;more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care,&#8221; a $2,000 tax credit to allow the uninsured to buy insurance, and a plan to &#8220;allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines.&#8221; A version of drug assistance for low-income seniors does take effect this year, but after four years it&#8217;s hardly the &#8220;immediate help&#8221; Bush promised in 2000. A patients&#8217; bill of rights never passed, and has been forgotten for several years now.</p>
<p>Bush has done almost nothing to help the uninsured. The truly brazen thing is that Bush is now <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040902.html">repeating the same promises</a> from 2000. His plan to help the uninsured includes &#8220;a health center or clinic in every poor county in America&#8221; and a &#8220;national marketplace to shop for health insurance,&#8221; just as it did four years ago. It also still includes a new tax credit for low-income households to buy insurance, although this time around it can only be used to buy a high-deductible insurance plan and a &#8220;health savings account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps we should be grateful for the broken promises. Bush&#8217;s plan to institute a &#8220;national marketplace in health insurance,&#8221; for example, is more a threat than a promise. The point is to prevent regulation of insurance by the states. Presumably bad state regulations would be driven out by competition, but so would good ones. We&#8217;d all buy our insurance from Delaware, I suppose, or whatever state has the laxest regulations, just like we all get our credit cards from Delaware-based banks.</p>
<p>Kerry ought to be calling Bush on this.  Perhaps he could quote from the 2000 debates, when Bush said, &#8220;I want to remind you, <a href="http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2000b.html">the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Later this week, at <a href="http://ragout.blogspot.com/">Ragout</a>, I&#8217;m going to look at some more elements of Bush&#8217;s attempt to cast himself as a moderate, especially his new-found love for job training and community colleges.<br /></p>
