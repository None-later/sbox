As its free lunch proponents often try to sell DeMint’s ideas, Mark is absolutely correct.  But now the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/press/dailybriefing/policyweblog.cfm?blogid=2F5DF947-DC72-C238-B6E6809B5A2DA3F3">Heritage Foundation</a> tries to explain how a GROW proposal would reduce the alleged long-run insolvency problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposal would reduce traditional Social Security benefit that workers receive by an amount equal in real terms, more or less, to the surplus funds deposited in their accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Heritage Foundation thinks DeMint’s “GROW” proposal is really a benefit cut?  Actually, it is more akin to taking a dollar out of one’s left pocket and placing it into one’s right pocket.  </p>
<p>The DeMint plan does nothing to reduce the long-term insolvency problem of the overall Federal government -where the main issue is the massive General Fund deficit created by the fiscal irresponsibility since 2001 when the GOP assumed leadership in Washington.  But the Heritage Foundation is correct in saying it does nothing to worsen it either precisely because it does not increase the future benefits to young workers at all.  And yet, the proponents of this proposal try to claim that it will make young workers better off even as it somehow reduces the long-term insolvency problem of the overall Federal government.  Unless money grows on trees – you can’t have it both ways.  But this realization has never stopped the privatization crowd from lying to young workers.</p>

<p>It seems these hearings were attended by only Democratic members of Congress.  I hope Republican members read the transcripts.  </p>
<p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/233554_thomas22.html">Helen Thomas</a> notes how President Bush has lowered the bar for what is acceptable (hat tip to Mark Thoma).</p>
<p>Speaking of lowering the bar, the <a href="http://media.nationalreview.com/070430.asp">National Review</a> finds perjury and obstruction of justice perfectly acceptable behavior for a Republican Administration.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I’d like to thank CalculatedRisk for <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/07/24.html#a4124">this link</a> to a discussion of the <em>Face the Nation</em> interview where Alberto Gonzalez had trouble with Bob Schieffer’s question as to the 12-hour delay to inform the White House staff that it must “preserve all materials”.  Now note this claim from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_24_corner-archive.asp#070569">Andy McCarthy</a> about how President Bush is not evading the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>He encouraged the investigation, he made statements about taking action against wrongdoers, and he has repeatedly said he wants the independent counsel to press ahead because he wants to know what happened. He has also sat for an interview himself and encouraged everyone in his administration to be cooperative.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>National Review</em> continues its string of dishonesty in their feeble defense of this Administration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II</em></strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_24_corner-archive.asp#070725">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> points to <a href="http://www.regnumcrucis.blogspot.com/2005_07_17_regnumcrucis_archive.html#112213791370833411">this post</a>, which accuses Larry Johnson et al. with playing politics with PlameGate.  Sad – as I had hoped Mr. Ponnuru would not so lower himself in the National Review’s efforts to blame others for Rove’s behavior.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001481.html">Dean Baker</a> does a nice job of explaining why a significant yuan revaluation will increase our net exports to China – at least a little.  Dean’s implicit assumption is that the nominal revaluation will lead to an increase in the relative price of Chinese goods, which seems valid given the very modest inflation rates in both nations.  I have only two quibbles with Dean’s discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process of raising the price of imported goods to people in the U.S. through an increase in the value of foreign currencies (which also makes our exports cheaper to other countries) is the only way to get our trade deficit down, other than a recession … The people who whine about how the budget deficit is causing the trade deficit (apart from any possible impacts on the value of the dollar) are proclaiming their ignorance. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you are thinking that Dean left off trade protection (the first quibble), maybe Robert Mundell might help rescue Dean’s claim – assuming we eventually move to a freely floating yuan.  Mundell might tell the trade protectionists that tariffs on Chinese imports would be offset by a yuan devaluation so that our exports to China would decline as much as the tariffs reduced our imports from China.</p>
<p>But this Mundell line of thinking leads me to my second quibble as I have been whining about the U.S. budget deficit.  To say the U.S. fiscal stimulus does not impact the trade deficit apart from possible impacts on the value of the dollar is akin to saying an outside shift in the demand for a good does not induce more production apart from possible impacts on the price of that good.  But again – I’m assuming a freely floating exchange rate.  </p>
<p>Alas, I had to also read <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200507220844.asp">Michael Darda</a> who clearly has never read the <em>General Theory</em> by Lord Keynes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if we accept this assertion (which is false), the Keynesian cure is worse than the supposed labor market disease. The neo-Keynesian elixir typically is a combination of higher tax rates on the entrepreneurial class (the rich), higher tariffs, and a devalued dollar. Africa and Latin America, which have binged on this advice for three decades, show exactly what the effects have been: no growth, dire poverty, disease, and desperation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I consider myself a Keynesian but I’m not advocating trade protection or a larger government.  I’m also an advocate of letting the market determine the value of currencies.  If Mr. Darda wants to bash the Schumer-Graham bill, he might be delighted than many Keynesian economists are also suggesting that this proposal is bad policy.  </p>
<p>But it seems that the real purposes of his NRO oped are to: (1) tell us that the labor market is doing just fine; and (2) to advocate a return to the gold standard.  On the first, the key passages are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor compensation is growing above a 7 percent annual rate while aggregate hours worked are rising … The chain-weighted capital-to-labor ratio, the raw fuel for productivity and income growth, has reached record levels and continues to grow at a two-digit pace, well above historical norms.  Those arguing that the labor market is weak insist the unemployment rate has dropped due to a declining labor force participation rate. They also argue that low-end wages are not keeping up with inflation. Even if we accept this assertion (which is false) … The employment participation rate &#8211; the fraction of the population in the labor force &#8211; only is 0.8 percent below its average from 1992-2000, which was biased upward due to dot-com overhiring. Since 2004, the participation rate has averaged 66 percent while the unemployment rate has dropped to 5 percent from 5.7 percent. Non-farm payrolls have expanded by more than 3.2 million during this period. This completely refutes the nonsensical claim that a mass exodus from the labor force has been the primary driver of the recent fall in the employment rate.  Since 2001, the growth rate of real wages of non-supervisory production workers, a group under pressure in the global economy, is about 0.9 percent above the rate of inflation (using the non-core PCE deflator). This is about 75 percent of the average from 1992-2000 and more than three times the average from 1971-2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that he begins this spin by looking at the growth of nominal compensation as opposed to the change in real wages.  It is true that real wages rose during 2001, but real wages as of June 2005 were actually below what they were as of December 2001.  His statement about non-farm payroll employment is simply wrong, but he does get it right when he says the employment to population ratio is lower than it was when Bush took office.  As far as his comment about the capital to labor ratio, it strikes me as either incorrect of incomprehensible.  </p>
<p>Alas, the <em>National Review</em> had another opportunity to make a clear case for free trade but let the writer drift onto another topic – where the writer wrote more of NRO’s patented nonsense.  So let me close by thanking Dean Baker for both sticking to the topic and writing sensibly.</p>

                                <p>Before I launch into the possible role of Condi Rice, let’s review what we have learned just since in the last couple of days:</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/07/21/breaking-bloomberg-reporting-that-rove-libby-may-be-subject-to-perjury-charges">Scooter Libby</a> is blaming Tim Russert.</p>
<p>The memo taken onto Air Force One on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/20/AR2005072002517.html">July 7, 2003</a> had an “S” to denote that it was secret – as in classified.</p>
<p>George Tenet’s <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_07_17.php#006149">mea culpa</a> regarding those sixteen words may have been drafted by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.</p>
<p>Now to my little speculation.  The Bush Administration and its minions have been on an overzealous campaign to smear Joseph Wilson for over two years.  Part of this campaign involved the revelation that his wife – Valerie Plame – was a CIA operative.  One of these minions is our own Patrick R. Sullivan (aka Roland Patrick) who somehow believed that Wolf Blitzer’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/13/le.00.html">7/13/2003 interview </a> vindicated Karl Rove’s telling reporters about the fact that Wilson’s wife worked for the CIA:</p>
<blockquote><p>BLITZER: Who sent him?<br />RICE: Well, it was certainly not a level that had anything to do with the White House, and I do not believe at a level that had anything to do with the leadership of the CIA.<br />BLITZER: Supposedly, it came at the request of the vice president.<br />RICE: No, this is simply not true, and this is something that&#8217;s been perpetuated that we simply have to straighten out. The vice president did not ask that Joe Wilson go to Niger. The vice president did not know. I don&#8217;t think he knew who Joe Wilson was, and he certainly didn&#8217;t know that he was going. The first that I heard of Joe Wilson mission was when I was doing a Sunday talk show and heard about it. The other thing is that the reporting, at least, of what Ambassador Wilson told the CIA debriefers says that, yes, Niger denied that there had been such a deal made, that they had sold uranium to the Iraqis. It also apparently says, according to this report, it also apparently says that one of the people who was meeting with the Iraqis thought that they might, in fact, be trying to use commercial activity to talk about yellow cake. So what the director says in his statement is that they believed, when they looked at what was reported about the Wilson trip, that it was inconclusive. They therefore did not brief it to the president, the vice president or any senior officials. So no, the Wilson trip was not sent by anyone at a high level. It wasn&#8217;t briefed to anyone at high level. And it appears to have been inconclusive in what it found.<br />BLITZER: Did George Tenet know about the Joe Wilson trip to Africa?<br />RICE: I am not aware that George Tenet was aware that this happened before it happened.<br />BLITZER: Let me read to you what Joe Wilson wrote in &#8220;The New York Times&#8221; in that op-ed piece on July 6th. &#8220;I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq&#8217;s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, the “who sent him” did not seem to be a big deal.  In fact, it is still not a relevant matter except for one aspect of the smear Joe Wilson mantra.  The rightwing wants us to believe that Wilson lied in his 7/6/2003.  After all – they claim that Wilson said Cheney sent him.  Or they claim that Wilson said Tenet sent him.  But if one reads what Wilson wrote, he did not say either Cheney or Tenet sent him.  Now I’ll concede one could be part of the smear Joe Wilson campaign but not part of the outing of Valerie Plame.  </p>
<p>Now we see that Daxman over at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/7/20/16340/8649">TPMCafe</a> is wondering if Condi Rice was in on the outing of Ms. Plame:</p>
<blockquote><p>But a key exchange on the Wilson trip did occur in the July 11, 2003 press gaggle aboard Air Force One with both Ari Fleischer and Condoleezza Rice and it wasn’t  Ari pushing the Wilson story. The transcript of the July 11, 2003 press gaggle has this interesting exchange:<br />Q Dr. Rice, when did you all find out that the documents were forged? <br />DR. RICE: Sometime in March, I believe. Is that right? <br />MR. FLEISCHER: The IAEA reported it. <br />DR. RICE: The IAEA reported it I believe in March. But I will tell you that, for instance, on Ambassador Wilson&#8217;s going out to Niger, I learned of that when I was sitting on whatever TV show it was, because that mission was not known to anybody in the White House. And you should ask the Agency at what level it was known in the Agency. <br />Q When was that TV show, when you learned about it? <br />DR. RICE: A month ago, about a month ago. <br />Q Can I ask you about something else? <br />DR. RICE: Yes. Are you sure you&#8217;re through with this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Daxman continues with his interpretation of what Dr. Rice was up to here.  While Bush minion Roland Patrick was trying to convince us that the press was very interested in “who sent him” on July 13, they were not interested in this aspect of Dr. Rice’s mantra two days earlier.  I guess Dr. Rice got Wolf interested over the next couple of days.  What I find hilarious is that the more the rightwing tries to divert attention from Rove’s misdeeds, the more members of the White House they drag into this scandal. </p>
<p>Let me close with the insights from <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0507210027jul21,0,7088012.story?coll=chi-newsopinioncommentary-hed">Molly Ivins</a> via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/the_truth_is_ou.html">Mark Thoma</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>If the Washington press corps had a memory bank longer than 10 minutes, it could have exposed this years ago. The lies so often directly contradict one another.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The latest in free lunch supply-side spin from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_kucewicz/kucewicz200507210902.asp">William Kucewicz</a> actually provides some useful information.  For example, his chart of Germany’s unemployment rate distinguishing between the high unemployment rate for East Germany versus the more modest unemployment rate for West Germany.  As I gazed at his chart, my first thought was whether German policy would try to promote more investment in this formerly Communist region.  </p>
<p>Kucewicz, however, began with a discussion of the cost of labor:</p>
<blockquote><p>German workers are among the world’s most expensive. According to a recent OECD study, the average German manufacturing worker’s marginal tax rate, including income and social security taxes, is a whopping 40.5 percent. Adding the employer’s social security contributions brings the marginal rate up to 50.7 percent for the average German manufacturing wage earner with no dependents. It’s small wonder, then, that unemployment is nearing the five-million mark.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that Germany has a large public sector and relatively high marginal tax rates.  However, the cost of labor is not the tax rate.  Tax rates place a wedge between the before-tax wage and the after-tax wage with most of the incidence of the tax being borne by workers rather than firms unless the elasticity of labor supply is high (see the latest from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/paul-krugman-on-labor-market.html">Jude Wanniski</a> for evidence that the supply-siders don’t even understand their own model).  Using <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2005/01/pdf/statappx.pdf">this IMF document</a>, we can examine the changes in wages, prices, and productivity (tables 8 and 9) to compare how unit labor costs have evolved in Germany versus the U.S. since 1997.  Even though the U.S. has enjoyed faster productivity growth than Germany, its unit labor costs have not risen relative to those in the U.S. as earnings growth has been less.  </p>
<p>Kucewicz also notes Germany’s deficit problems and its “anemic private capital investment”.  Both are fair points, but they apply equally to the U.S. situation.  A commitment to long-term fiscal restraint would be welcomed policy – both in Germany and in the U.S.  If the Germans are willing to cut back on the size of their public sector, it might achieve fiscal restraint without large tax increases.  Otherwise, I can understand why Angela Merkel is suggesting tax increases.</p>

<blockquote><p>Of particular concern is the prospect that the upcoming high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly from September 14-16 will be used to implement various ideas for international taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gaffney is arguing that we need to approve the nomination of Mr. Bolton to the UN.  </p>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Gaffney, the UN proposal is something I had not even thought about.  Gaffney opposes the idea, but let me off a case for it.  President Bush has declared a Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) to combat Al Qaeda (OK, the invasion of Iraq was an incredible blunder, but that’s for another discussion).  The benefits of GWOT would accrue to citizens in all nations (e.g., the UK which had to endure another terrorist incident today).  In a similar vein as Prime Minister Blair’s plea for international cooperation in addressing the problem of global warming, an internationally coordinated effort to fund GWOT might address the problem of free riding.  </p>
<p>I trust Mr. Gaffney agrees that the world community needs to do more to combat Al Qaeda’s terrorism.  I also trust Mr. Gaffney does not think money grows on trees (even if this proposition seems to lie at the heart of free lunch supply-side dogma).  I hope Mr. Gaffney is not proposing that the U.S. free ride GWOT the way we have ignored Kyoto.  Rather than mock Mr. Gaffney, why don’t we liberals ask him how the world should fund GWOT?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/07/should_we_worry.html">James Hamilton</a> has an excellent discussion of why we should be concerned about the large current account deficits, while <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/are_american_co.html">David Altig</a> follows-up with the hope that this borrowing is only temporary.  The point being made by James would have equally applied to the large deficits that followed the Reagan fiscal stimulus a generation ago as they apply today.  During the early 1980’s, apologists for the fiscal stimulus tried to argue that borrowing to finance increases in investment could increase real GDP growth, but the facts were then that investment demand fell but not as much as to the decline in national savings.  James provides a very nice chart showing net investment as a share of GDP from 1965 to 2004 as well as national savings.  Despite the recent recovery of investment, its share of GDP is still quite modest, while the national savings rate is very low.  </p>
<p>David, however, argues that low interest rates are not indicative of a “consumption binge”.  While he notes the global savings glut hypothesis, his discussion is consistent with the driving factor being a decline in investment demand.  In a way, David is hinting at the old Keynesian paradox of thrift justification for short-term fiscal stimulus.  Sensible Keynesians, such as Robert Rubin, might continue by saying short-term stimulus might be good policy during a transitional investment slump, but the Bush call for long-term fiscal stimulus is not a pro-growth agenda.  Simply put – as this transitional slump in investment demand reverses itself, the Federal Reserve will be compelled to raise interest rates if the fiscal stimulus is not reversed.  Over the long-term, the extra consumption does crowd-out both investment and net exports.  <br />

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Apparently, the rumors were true.  China made <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&#038;id=542">the big announcement</a> today:<br />
<blockquote>1. Starting from July 21, 2005, China will reform the exchange rate regime by moving into a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. RMB will no longer be pegged to the US dollar and the RMB exchange rate regime will be improved with greater flexibility. </p>
<p>2. The People&#8217;s Bank of China will announce the closing price of a foreign currency such as the US dollar traded against the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each working day, and will make it the central parity for the trading against the RMB on the following working day.</p>
<p>3. The exchange rate of the US dollar against the RMB will be adjusted to 8.11 yuan per US dollar at the time of 19:00 hours of July 21, 2005. The foreign exchange designated banks may since adjust quotations of foreign currencies to their customers.</p>
<p>4. The daily trading price of the US dollar against the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market will continue to be allowed to float within a band of 0.3 percent around the central parity published by the People&#8217;s Bank of China, while the trading prices of the non-US dollar currencies against the RMB will be allowed to move within a certain band announced by the People&#8217;s Bank of China.</p></blockquote>
<p>My first reaction is to keep a close eye on the bond market.  Will long-term interest rates be bid up substantially today?  (As of 10:00am EDT, 10-yr treasury bond yields had risen from about 4.18% to 4.23%.) They might, if the bond market thinks that China can now reduce its purchases of dollars.  This would happen if the currency markets stop putting pressure on the yuan to appreciate, which would happen if this slight change in the exchange rate is enough to make the yuan less attractive to investors than it has been.</p>
<p>However, another possibility is that China could actually face <em>increased</em> capital inflows as a result of this small move, if people speculate that this is just the beginning of a series of small revaluations (or one long, steady revaluation trend) of the yuan.  In fact, I think it quite likely that China will face increased demand for yuan now, rather than decreased demand.  This might be particularly true if I&#8217;m correctly reading item #2 above to suggest that the exchange rate can gradually crawl downward (since the closing price of one day, which could be up to 0.15% lower than that day&#8217;s starting price, becomes the starting price the next day).  </p>
<p>In short, I can easily imagine that the PBOC may actually have to increase the rate of accumulation of dollar assets as a result of this change in their exchange rate regime, at least for a while.  Presumably that was not their goal in making this change, so it will be extremely interesting to see what happens&#8230;</p>

                                <p>The <em>National Review</em> was barely commenting upon PlameGate until the White House distributed its talking points (excuse me – I meant pack of lies) and then we received a barrage of silliness from these erstwhile patriots.  But all of a sudden, their silly stories disappeared and the comments from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_17_corner-archive.asp#070203">The Corner</a> stopped dead in their tracks right after 10:30 EDT yesterday.  If I did not know better, President Bush rushed forward a Supreme Court nomination.  </p>
<p>Before the marching orders were sent to NRO that PlameGate would no longer be discussed, Cliff May wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isn’t it the Wilson team that is moving the goal posts? Initially, this story was about an orchestrated government conspiracy to feed reporters misleading information so as to intentionally expose a top secret CIA agent in order to damage a whistle-blower and intimidate others. Now this story is about whether Karl Rove answered a question from a reporter truthfully, regarding a false claim made by Wilson who didn’t conduct a serious investigation into anything, and whose wife may or may not have been undercover in recent years. Reporters are outraged that Rove didn’t hide from them what he knew to be the facts, didn’t say: “Sorry, I can’t comment” &#8211; which is, of course, what Washington reporters always hope to hear from their sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess such misinformation is the reason KLo linked to <a href="http://media.nationalreview.com/069853.asp">bit of insulting nonsense</a>. Just in case, KLo fails to appreciate what we are trying to say, let me suggest that the public is well informed in spite of the National Review’s best efforts to distort this issue.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/07/revenue_situati.html">Brad DeLong</a> for noting the analysis from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-12-05bud.pdf">Richard Kogan and Isaac Shapiro</a> who write:</p>
<blockquote><p>The trimming of the deficit is certainly a positive development. But this development does not lead to the conclusion that “the tax cuts are working,” as some now are claiming. Furthermore, the reduction in this year’s deficit from a very large one to a large one has little bearing on the nation’s shaky long-term fiscal foundation. A surge in economic growth is not behind the unexpected increase in 2005 revenues. Real economic growth in 2005 has not been unusually rapid, nor has it been stronger than was projected earlier this year by CBO or OMB. Thus, the unexpected gain in revenues does not reflect faster-than-anticipated economic growth. CBO has said that one possible reason that revenues are coming in faster than it forecast earlier this year is that increases in income may be more concentrated among high income taxpayers than it anticipated.</p></blockquote>
