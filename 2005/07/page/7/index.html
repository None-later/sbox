                                <p>The June employment report can be found <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">here</a>. Payroll employment grew by 146 thousand.  With a similar estimated increase per the Household Survey, employment growth matched population growth with the employment to population ratio remaining at 62.7%.</p>
<p>Now you may have heard that the unemployment rate fell from 5.1% to 5.0% and wondered if that means that the labor force participation rate fell from 66.1% to 66.0%.  If so, you would have been exactly right.</p>
<p>Alas – the labor market weakness continues.  Hopefully, we will see faster employment growth for the rest of the year – even though I see no reason to predict as much.</p>

                                <p>Jonah Goldberg comments over at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">NRO’s The Corner</a> is turning out to be an efficient ways of keeping up with the right’s reaction to the possibility that Karl Rove leaked the identity of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative.  At first, it was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/plamegate-rove-right-reacts.html">denial</a>.  Now Mr. Goldberg has evolved to the “so what” stage.  In his MILLER &#038; COOPER II, he states: </p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think a crime was committed, according to the actual law, and I sincerely doubt that the White House intended to &#8220;out&#8221; Plame as a way to punish Joe Wilson. I think this was a theory largely burped out of one of the folds of Joe Wilson&#8217;s Jabba-the-Hut sized ego). I think Fitzgerald was bullied into this prosecution by a feverishly anti-Bush media feeding frenzy. I think this prosecution &#8211; seen from the outside &#8211; makes no sense. I think Firtzgerald had better have a good reason for what he&#8217;s doing or it will kill his political career.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the not a crime issue, see <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/valerie_plame_/2005/07/no_crime_in_the_plame_case_thats_not_what_the_judge_thinks.php">Mark Kleiman</a>.  Then again, Ed Meese suggested Ms. Plame was <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200507070001">not a CIA operative</a>.</p>
<p>In his MILLER &#038; COOPER I, Mr. Goldberg launched into the standard rant of liberals excused crimes by Bill Clinton:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason this is interesting is it illustrates the utilitarianism of at least some liberals when it comes to first principles. There’s no way of proving this, but I cannot imagine that these callers would have taken the same position if Bill Clinton’s White House was the target.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee – I thought Ms. Lewinsky was simply the object of Clinton’s adulterous lust and not a CIA asset.  But this may explain the latest Clinton bashing from NRO’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lopez/lopez.asp">Kathryn Lopex</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It helps perpetuate the long-standing myth that the Bill Clinton impeachment trial was all about sex. It wasn&#8217;t.  Back around 1994, an independent counsel was appointed by Bill Clinton&#8217;s attorney general (Janet Reno, not Ann Coulter) to investigate a land deal that went awry &#8230; What crimes did the House of Representatives find sufficient evidence for which to require Bill Clinton to stand trial before the Senate? Providing &#8220;perjurious, false and misleading testimony&#8221; to a grand jury and of obstruction of justice &#8220;in an effort to delay, impede, cover up and conceal&#8221; evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, Ms. Lopez shows utter disdain for her readers as she fails to tell them two critical matters.  The special prosecutors never brought charges against President Clinton on matters related to this land deal.  Secondly, all of the House’s charges involved the President’s refusal to initially come clean about his affair.  </p>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: the NRO is obsessed about an affair but is not concerned over the outing of a CIA operative for partisan and vindictive purposes.</p>

                                <p>I guess we should not be surprised that the <em>National Review</em> is expressing jingoist noises, but I found Andrew McCarthy’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200507071247.asp">It’s War, or Isn’t It</a> interesting on a couple of levels.  One is that most of us in this nation and in Europe have realized there is a war against Al Qaeda since September 11, 2001.  And yet, he suggests we need a reminder.  Some of the jingoism comes from <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200507070005">Fox News</a>, which seems to have forgotten about the Madrid bombings.  </p>
<p>But it is the ending of McCarthy’s tirade that was the most interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prime Minister Blair has been a staunch ally after 9/11, but many in his country, and throughout Europe, have not grasped what we are up against.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the risk of repeating myself – most of us in this nation and in Europe have realized there is a war against Al Qaeda, which was not an ally of Saddam Hussein.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the wake of this morning’s horrible <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/811a3330-eec3-11d9-8b10-00000e2511c8.html">terrorist attacks</a> in central London, it’s natural to notice that the terrorists chose to target London’s financial and tourist industries.  In that respect, this attack was very much like the attack on the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>But what are the economic effects of such attacks likely to be?</p>
<p>Using the September 2001 attacks as an example, I can think of four main channels that could cause today&#8217;s terrorist attacks to have some real economic effects.  (Note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just an off-the-top-of-my-head list.)
<ol>
<li>Consumer confidence.  If consumers decide to curtail their spending in the wake of an attack, this could reduce overall demand and thus economic growth.  In the wake of the September 2001 attacks this did indeed slow consumer spending in the US&#8230; for about a month.  In October 2001 consumers then did their patriotic duty and went on a shopping spree, one that has really continued ever since. </p>
<p>However, the British economy today may well be more vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer spending, for a couple of reasons.  First, the economy in the UK already seemed very vulnerable to a slowdown; in fact, it may have already started slowing significantly <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/06/britain-headed-for-hard-landing.html">over the past couple of months</a>. </p>
<p>Second, a relatively large percentage of consumer spending in the UK happens in London, both because a large portion of the British population actually live in London, and because it is the shopping hub for even more.  Thus today&#8217;s attacks make it more likely that a substantial portion of the British population could be physically and emotionally deterred, at least for a little while, from taking the train into town to go shopping.</p>
</li>
<li>Business confidence.  Businesses may also decide to reduce their investment spending in the wake of a terrorist attack.  In the US in the wake of the 2001 attacks, this effect was probably far greater than the effect on consumers.  Business spending remained weak for years after the 2001 attack, and one of the oft-mentioned reasons for this weakness during 2002 and 2003 was “geopolitical uncertainty”.   This terms was not meant to simply describe the prospect of further attacks by terrorists, but also uncertainty about whether the US would be invading other countries, what would happen in the Middle East, etc.
<p>This to me seems a smaller danger in the case of today’s attacks in London; it’s unlikely that the attacks will do much to the overall geopolitical stability of the Middle East or the rest or the world.</p>
</li>
<li>Security costs.  If today’s attacks cause significantly tighter security measures, this could dampen economic activity.  In the US, this may have been particularly noticeable in its effect depressing air travel and international trade, with long queues at many security and customs checkpoints.  The direct costs of security matter here too, but I suspect that the indirect costs imposed by security hassles far outweigh any direct cost that increased security might impose on a country.
</li>
<li>International investment.  A new paper by <a href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~aabadie/twe.pdf">Alberto Abadie and Javier Gardeazabal</a> examines the possibility that terrorist attacks may dampen international investment activates.  They specifically find that foreign direct investment – the purchases or creation of entire firms in another country – falls significantly in the wake of a terrorist attack.  This reduced investment can, in turn, contribute to reduced overall demand in a country.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that I don’t have any financial market effects in my list.  Personally, I think that financial markets are diversified enough (both physically and monetarily) that the financial effects of any particular terrorist attack are quickly erased.  In that sense, I think terrorists may be a bit naive to think that targeting a financial district is the best way to hurt a country’s economy.  Even completely shutting down a major financial district for a while, as they succeeded in doing in 2001 in New York, probably has no measurable effect on the economy.  </p>
<p>But in another sense the terrorists are not naive at all.  They know that hurting a country’s economy is the best way to have an impact on a country, and they know that a spectacular terrorist attack really can have economic effects.  In a couple of months we’ll probably have some sense of whether today’s attack succeeded in that dimension. </p>

<blockquote><p>Paris was exactly the right place to pick and the Olympic committee screwed up. Why? Simple. It would have been a three-week period where we wouldn&#8217;t have had to worry about terrorism. First, the French think they are so good at dealing with the Arab world that they would have gone out and paid every terrorist off. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Today’s news of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/06/news/economy/job_cuts/index.htm">increased layoffs</a> raises the question of why the Federal Reserve is allowing short-term interest rates to rise.  <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/06/whats_the_fed_u.html">David Altig</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/inflation_targe.html">Mark Thoma</a> offer the explanation that perhaps the Federal Reserve believes we are near full employment so that if the Federal Reserve allows aggregate demand growth to outstrip the increase in potential output, inflation will accelerate.  <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001431.html">Max Sawicky</a> is not happy with the current tightening of monetary policy and offered these questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. How big is the output gap?<br />2. What is the minimum acceptable or safe rate of unemployment?<br />3. What is the maximum acceptable or safe employment to population ratio?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/06/unfinished_busi.html">David replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mechanically, that&#8217;s an easy one to answer.  The estimated Taylor rule in the pictures from my earlier posts used an output-gap measure based on the Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s estimates of potential GDP.  The current gap derived from this calculation is just a bit over 1 percent (where the gap is measured as potential GDP less actual GDP) … For my money, this is an upper bound on reasonable estimates of the output gap.  I say it is an upper bound because this way of calculating an output gap is, in fact, pretty old-fashioned.  In particular, it is not obvious that the CBO measure of potential conforms to our current understanding of how potential GDP ought to be measured. </p></blockquote>
<p>Since David did not answer Max’s third question, let me begin by graphing the employment to population ratio from January 1996 to May 2005 as well as the capacity utilization rate over the same period.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/m1.JPG"></p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/m2.JPG"></p>
<p>David’s premise that the output gap is less than 1% is consistent with a target for the employment to population ratio near 63% and a target capacity utilization rate of 80%.  Yet, the late 1990’s often saw an employment to population ratio equal to or greater than 64% and a capacity utilization rate equal to or greater than 82%.  Even if one concedes that real business cycle events would lead one to believe that full employment should be defined in terms of  somewhat lower levels for the employment to population ratio and the capacity utilization rate, I find it hard to believe that we are close to full employment.</p>
<p>In fact, the following graph of the output gap using the CBO estimate of potential output should illustrate my contention that the CBO measure is very conservative.  For example, the late 1960’s may have been a period of excess demand but the estimate that we were 6% beyond potential seems incredulous as does the suggestion that we were beyond full employment for the entire second half of the 1990’s.  Similarly, the estimated gaps for 1982 and the recent recession seem to be very low.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/m3.JPG"></p>
<p>In a way, this debate is similar to the one between <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/the_school_of_h.html">Mark</a> and <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2005/nf20050628_8255_db013.htm">Chris Farrell</a> where Chris is concerned that not allowing the economy to run “hot” will deter investment demand – especially investment in R&#038;D.  If Chris is saying that it is a mistake to run contractionary aggregate demand policies when the economy is below full employment, his left-leaning Keynesian position has merit.  While “hot” is an ambiguous term, some economists would note that NAIRU and full employment may have different meanings.  Let’s recall that there was a heated debate over monetary policy as Paul Volcker took reign over the Federal Reserve and some economists (including me) thought his monetary restraint during the latter part of the Carter Administration was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: AB reader Spencer offers an important counterpoint to David Altig’s discussion of real shocks.  While David may be correct in his suggestion that real shocks may have reduced potential output relative to the way the CBO determines its estimate, the real shocks of the late 1990’s were favorable.  Spencer notes that the CBO estimation procedure may have missed these positive real shocks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II</em></strong>: With many thanks to Mark Thoma, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=3020&#038;sequence=0">this August 2001 document</a> explains how the CBO estimates potential output.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This weekend began with an apparent bombshell from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/lawrence-odonnell/its-rove_3556.html">Lawrence O’Donnell</a> during the taping of the McLaughlin Group: </p>
<blockquote><p>Time magazine&#8217;s emails will reveal that Karl Rove was Matt Cooper&#8217;s source. I have known this for months but didn&#8217;t want to say it at a time that would risk me getting dragged into the grand jury.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the left side of the Blogworld has been all over this, we have seen just a few press reports with none from Fox News.  The reaction right side of the BlogWorld seems be denial.  NRO’s <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">The Corner</a> featured Jonah Goldberg’s prediction on Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rove didn&#8217;t do it. But, as Glenn Reynolds notes, the possibility will cause many liberals to have a second case of whiplash (the first being their sudden disapproval of the investigation they essentially started when it became clear that the Times and Newsweek would get ensnared). Now that it seems possible Rove did it, many will suddenly re-fall in love with Patrick Fitzgerald. And if the person I *think* did it, did in fact do it, we will see even more plastic-collared liberals in the weeks to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the basis of his prediction seems to be that Goldberg cannot make up his mind, John Podhoretz had this “reasoning” on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Newsweek&#8217;s story doesn&#8217;t say that. It only says Rove spoke to Cooper, and Rove&#8217;s lawyer Robert Luskin offers a complete and flat denial that Rove said anything about Valerie Plame: &#8220;Luskin told NEWSWEEK that Rove &#8216;never knowingly disclosed classified information&#8217; and that &#8216;he did not tell any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA.&#8217; Luskin declined, however, to discuss any other details. He did say that Rove himself had testified before the grand jury &#8216;two or three times&#8217; and signed a waiver authorizing reporters to testify about their conversations with him. &#8216;He has answered every question that has been put to him about his conversations with Cooper and anybody else,&#8217; Luskin said.&#8221; Seems to me that unless Luskin is lying, Rove is in the clear.</p></blockquote>
<p>By Podhoretz’s standard of evidence, we would never need to have trials if the defense attorney declares his client is not guilty.  Credit goes to <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2005/07/karl_rove_and_t.html">Tom MaGuire</a> for not being so gullible.  </p>
<p>Credit should go to Tony Blankey for his comments on he McLaughlin Group as to why the prosecutor should be able to compel the testimony of Matt Cooper.

                                <p>After a nice long weekend, a little reading &#8230;</p>
<p>NY Times on Australia: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/realestate/05aussie.html">Hole in the Housing Bubble</a><br />
<blockquote>The Australian housing boom has come to a halt, in a move that many see as the first signs of the end to a housing bubble, not just in Australia, but also in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p> Baltimore Sun: <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-te.bz.invest03jul03,1,3376975.story?page=1&#038;coll=bal-business-headlines&#038;ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Investors heat up housing market</a>  Investors have bought 2/3 of all houses sold so far this year in Baltimore.  Talk about speculation!<br />
<blockquote>Two out of three houses sold in Baltimore this year have been snapped up by people who don&#8217;t intend to live in them, an unusually high amount of investor activity that is adding fuel to the city&#8217;s efforts to revive itself &#8211; but could endanger housing values down the road.</p>
<p>Investor purchases turned up in 2002 and have accelerated ever since, painting a picture of increasing frenzy. In 2001, about one out of three arms-length home sales were to &#8220;non owner-occupiers,&#8221; according to data from the state Department of Assessments and Taxation, analyzed by The Sun. Two years later, they accounted for half the sales, and in the first four months of this year, 67 percent. Early statistics for the following weeks show the trend strengthening.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Last week I asked who the potential &#8220;bag holders&#8221; were &#8211; and from the San Francisco Chronicle: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/26/BUGL5DEQJU1.DTL&#038;hw=Pender&#038;sn=004&#038;sc=826">Investors now shouldering the risks for home mortgages</a><br />
<blockquote>If the housing market weakened or collapsed and homeowners started to default on their mortgages in big numbers, who would be left holding the bag?</p>
<p>Thanks to the growing secondary market for home mortgages, much of the default risk has been transferred from banks and other lenders to investors who buy loans or, more often, interests in mortgage-backed securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>  More from the Chronicle article:<br />
<blockquote>Securities backed by pools of conforming mortgages are considered almost risk-free because if the borrowers default, Fannie or Freddie will pay off the loans (assuming Fannie and Freddie remain solvent).  </p>
<p>Non-conforming loans go into pools known as private-label securities. In the first quarter of 2005, loans in private-label mortgage securities accounted for 14.4 percent of all outstanding residential mortgage loans, up from just 9.7 percent in 2003, according to Federal Reserve data.</p></blockquote>
<p>  And finally a related NY Times article on hedge funds: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/business/yourmoney/03view.html">Could a Few Hedge Funds Spoil the Party?</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;in some markets, particularly fixed income and convertible arbitrage, &#8230; hedge funds have come to dominate. In May, in its latest report on global financial security, the International Monetary Fund found that hedge funds might account for 80 to 90 percent of all participants in those markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Some food for thought.  I hope everyone had a great Independence Day weekend.</p>

Perhaps <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2004/nf20040510_0257_db008.htm">this</a> will give us some clue.  </p>
<p>Mandel’s <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/06/mark_thoma_miss.html">first post</a> drew <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/growth-theory-v-monetary-economics.html">my fire</a> as he seemed to be suggesting economists like Paul Krugman and Mark Thoma did not realize the importance of intellectual capital – defined as education and R&#038;D to promote technological improvements.  </p>
<p>His next <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/07/why_the_hairshi.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/07/in_a_comment_pg.html">posts</a> indicate Mandel is frustrated that the Clinton years had Federal nondefense R&#038;D spending fall as a share of GDP.  I was a little surprised at this complaint for several reasons.  The following graph shows public education spending as a share of GDP indicating that it rose during the Clinton years.  But Mandel’s focus is on R&#038;D so the next graph shows total R&#038;D as a share of GDP and nondefense R&#038;D including civilian R&#038;D.  Federal nondefense R&#038;D was only 11% of total R&#038;D in 1992 and only 9.1% of total R&#038;D in 2000, while civilian R&#038;D was 63.2% of total R&#038;D in 1992 and 75% of total R&#038;D in 2000.  Why does Mandel focus on the former and not the latter?  </p>
<p>Before we address this question, let’s address this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other problem is that economists, who you might think would love the idea of fast growth, are not very comfortable with technology. It&#8217;s a real blind spot in the profession. Economists are more comfortable talking about thing like tax rates, budget deficits, or monetary policy. They&#8217;re much less comfortable talking about technology. They tend to ignore it or dismiss it, which is especially funny because very good economic research shows that over the long run, technology is the major driving force behind economic growth … In the book I discuss the relationship between growth, technology, financial markets, and politics. What I point out is that politicians do a lot of wrangling over budget deficits, but they pay far too little attention to technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mandel seems to be suggesting that some economists are posing a false trade-off.  Reducing budget deficits does not necessarily mean less investment in R&#038;D.  While the preference of the Clinton Administration was to raise taxes to reduce private consumption, the preference of fiscally responsible Republicans such as Phil Graham was to lower government consumption.  But Mandel seems to suggest other economists view a world where total (private and public) consumption is fixed, which implies a fixed amount of savings to be allocated to investments in physical capital versus intellectual capital.  </p>
<p>Economists are guilty, however, of wanting to weigh the prospective benefits of R&#038;D against their costs.  Free market economists might argue that the private sector properly weighs these two, but we should note that the social benefits of R&#038;D often exceed private benefits.  For this reason, a good case of policy interventions to encourage if not publicly fund R&#038;D can be made.  On this score, I agree with Mandel.  But here is the key question – how does the allocation of public funds weigh the opportunity cost of publicly funded R&#038;D against the prospective benefits.  A classic example is Star Wars where liberals often emphasize the costs and conservatives often discuss the possible benefits of a missile defense shield.  If one believes that the probability of success of Star Wars is very low, then the costs likely exceed the expected benefits.  But given the propensity of the Bush Administration to pretend we can cut taxes even as we increased defense spending, do our policymakers even recognize there is an opportunity cost?</p>

                                <p>Inspired by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/nouriel-roubini-v-free-lunch-supply.html">PGL’s reference</a> to the debate between <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/archives/2005/06/voodoo_economic.html">Nouriel Roubini and Art Laffer</a>, I visited Laffer’s house to talk to him.  But before I had a chance to ask him why he thinks the Laffer curve (the idea that cutting taxes will actually lead to higher tax revenues) actually has any empirical relevance to the US economy today, I overheard the following conversation between Laffer and his neighbor, an economist:<br />
<blockquote>Laffer:  &#8220;I cut the grass in front of my house last weekend.  And this week, it really grew rapidly.  You should see how tall my grass is now!  Yes, we received plentiful rain during the week.  But really I think that my cutting it last week is what really led to it getting so tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbor:  &#8220;In order to tell whether cutting the grass last weekend caused it to grow so tall, wouldn’t you have to compare it to how tall it <em>would</em> have been, and how fast it would have grown, if you <em>hadn’t</em> cut it last weekend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laffer:  &#8220;Don’t get all mumbo-jumbo technical with me.  I cut the grass last weekend, and it grew this week.  QED.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon hearing this I gave up my quest to have a serious conversation with Laffer, turned around, and went home.</p>
