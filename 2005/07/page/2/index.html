                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The title of the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg200507270748.asp">Jonah Goldberg</a> might suggest that he was about to criticize Governor Schwarzenegger.  Alas, this is as far as he goes in criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was against the recall on the grounds that the people of California elected Gray Davis and therefore they deserved to be punished. Seriously. Democracy isn’t merely about “the people” getting what they want, it’s also about the people getting what they deserve. Mobs get what they want every time.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least, this line settled a debate between me and my sensible but Republican wife.  We are planning a trip to vineyards of Northern California – and I had suggested she invite Mr. Goldberg so she did not have to deal with my liberalism on the long trip from Southern California.  But she acted very negatively saying clowns are not allowed in her car.  When I suggested she was being almost mean as he was, she pointed this out:</p>
<blockquote><p>California is doing better now, in part because of Schwarzenegger and in part because the economy has rebounded since 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>She then asked me as an economist to figure out what actual policies were mentioned in Mr. Goldberg’s op-ed.  Schwarzenegger may have given a speech before the Republican Convention last summer, but the wife noted as she watched it, it was as goofy as Zell Miller’s was insane.  </p>
<p>But why did we replace Gray Davis with Arnold Schwarzenegger?  As I recall, he promised to eliminate the deficit without tax increases or reductions in our commitment to education.  I thought then that this free lunch promise was absurd.  It seems the replacement governor has reduced our commitment to education and yet we still have a deficit – in spite of a recovery that has nothing to do with Schwarzenegger’s policies.  </p>
<p>Maybe we can help the wine country by mailing Mr. Goldberg a few bottles of wine given that the wife refuses to invite him on our trip.  I did say she was a sensible Republican.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Congressional Democrats yesterday put forth a proposal to try to boost the US&#8217;s household savings rate, which is extremely low both <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/how-low-can-it-go.html">compared to the past</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/international-saving-comparisons.html">compared to other countries</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/26/retirement/amerisave_plan/">CNN/Money</a>) &#8211; Democratic members of Congress introduced a retirement security plan Tuesday that promises to foster savings among middle- and working-class individuals.  The plan, known as AmeriSave, did not include any proposals regarding changes to Social Security. </p>
<p>&#8230;Under the plan, working and middle class individuals who participate in a retirement savings program such as a 401(k) or an IRA would have the first $1,000 contributed to their account matched by government funds.</p>
<p>Small businesses that do not currently offer retirement accounts for their workers would receive tax credits that would help cover the cost of administrating a retirement plan.</p>
<p>Another major initiative of the AmeriSave plan would be the reformation of bankruptcy and pension laws that would make it more difficult for corporations to dissolve pension plans.</p>
<p>&#8230;Workers would also be able to directly deposit tax refunds into a retirement savings account.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that something as simple as making monthly retirement plan contributions the default option for all workers could probably have some significantly positive effects on personal savings in the US.  I&#8217;m not sure how expensive these specific Democratic proposals would be, and we&#8217;d need to know that before we could decide how much sense these proposals make.  But it&#8217;s nice to know that someone in Washington is at least throwing out some ideas to address the US&#8217;s low savings rate &#8211; something that I do honestly think is setting the stage for some potentially serious economic problems down the road.</p>

                                <p>Today’s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/27/news/international/china_yuan.reut/index.htm">news</a> that the Chinese Central Bank is still managing the value of the yuan is a good excuse to revisit the issue as to whether the yuan is significantly undervalued.  Senator Lindsey Graham has been claimed that the yuan is undervalued by at least 15% and by as much as 40%.  His claim appears to come from the <em>2004 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission</em> (June 2004).  For example, page 4 of this report reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>A key factor contributing to the U.S. deficit with China is the undervaluation of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar. This gives Chinese manufacturers a competitive advantage over U.S. manufacturers. Economic fundamentals suggest that the Chinese yuan is undervalued, with a growing consensus of economists estimating the level of undervaluation to be anywhere from fifteen to forty percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB112195421057192103,00.htm">Roubini v. Altig</a> debate, Nouriel stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If China were to liberalize its capital account regime &#8211; on capital inflows as much as on capital outflows &#8211; and stop intervening, the Chinese currency could appreciate by more than 20%, minimum.</p></blockquote>
<p>David replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the overall scheme of things, if you put any faith at all in markets&#8217; ability to provide best guesses of such things, the expected magnitude of RMB-appreciation looks pretty moderate. By the last update I received, non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts were suggesting a total appreciation of about 8% over the next twelve months. That includes the 2% today. This is up a bit from yesterday, when 6% was the bet, but it still doesn&#8217;t add up to great drama.</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall discuss below why David’s evidence may not be a good measure of how undervalued the yen is.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/9246">Brad Setser</a> has been hinting that I should read <a href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~jfrankel/On%20the%20Renminbi.pdf"> On the Renminbi: The choice between adjustment under a fixed exchange rate and adjustment under a flexible rate </a> by Jeff Frankel.  This paper has a very nice discussion of the pros and cons of fixed versus floating exchange rates.  Frankel discusses the Balassa-Samuelson relationship and gives reasons to believe that the yuan is approximately 40% undervalued.  And as I think of David’s forward rate evidence, this comment is intriguing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Few economists would seriously recommend a revaluation over a short period of time of the yuan on the order of magnitude suggested by this interpretation of the Balassa-Samuelson equation. In the first place, a sudden revaluation of the currency of this magnitude would be disruptive. In the second place, other considerations matter in addition to the Balassa-Samuelson regression, including current monetary conditions. </p></blockquote>
<p>David’s forward rate evidence suggests the market’s expectation of yuan appreciation is less than 10%.  Suppose the market assigns a very small probability (say 10%) to the Chinese Central Bank letting the yuan appreciate significantly (say 40%) and a large probability (say 90%) to a modest revaluation (say less than 90%).  David’s evidence would be consistent with the results derived from the Balassa-Samuelson relationship.</p>
<p>With a hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/stiglitz_on_chi.html">Mark Thoma</a>, the recent comments from <br /><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/79797f04-fe00-11d9-a289-00000e2511c8.html">Joseph Stiglitz</a> provide a nice way to close this post.  Stiglitz – like Frankel – provides a good argument why freely floating exchange rates are not necessarily the optimal currency regime.  We can, however, imagine a significant revaluation of the yuan without resorting to a freely floating exchange rate.  For example, the UK Central Bank significantly devalued the pound in 1967 without abandoning Bretton Woods – although this exchange rate regime was abandoned later.  Stiglitz is correct that a yuan revaluation would have only a modest impact on the U.S. current account deficit.  He is also correct to note that this exchange rate issue is just one of many policy considerations facing both China and the U.S.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Is <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200507270835.asp">Donald Luskin</a> trying to deny the premise that the Chinese Central Bank is pegging the yuan/$ exchange rate?  If so, he truly is clueless.  If not, could someone explain to me what his latest rant is all about?</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: I left out the how fast and how far debate – but it seems that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/business/worldbusiness/23dollar.html?adxnnl=1&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;adxnnlx=1122491151-3ZwJqEUmg1UjW8X623UtqQ">Louis Uchitelle</a> had already filled this void (with hat tip to Brad DeLong).</p>
<p><em>Update III</em>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/laying_the_foun.html">David Altig</a> adds to the discussion.  As you might tell from my comment to his post, I agree with his latest.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> (see Dance PNAC Monkey Dance) catches <a href="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/883raiiu.asp">Gary Schmitt</a> sliming Larry Johnson.  We noted how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/plamegate-former-cia-agents-before.html">Ramesh Ponnunu</a> also accused Mr. Johnson of being a Democratic partisan.  <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/author/yglesias">Matthew Yglesias</a> places Schmitt v. Johnson in its proper context:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is &#8220;slime and defend&#8221; at its best. Joe Wilson said some stuff that was politically inconvenient for the White House. So the White House had to say some mean stuff about him. His wife got him his job. He was unqualified. If that entailed blowing a CIA operative&#8217;s cover, that&#8217;s no big deal. But now you need to slime his wife. She wasn&#8217;t really undercover. The Director of Central Intelligence, the Justice Department, a special prosecutor, and a whole series of federal judges are just confused, I guess. Now Johnson comes along and says the right is making stuff up, so it&#8217;s time to go after him. Simple as that. Now everyone&#8217;s put on notice &#8212; make trouble for the White House and they&#8217;ll come gunning for you.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_07/006798.php">Kevin Drum</a> provides further insight into the motivations of the Washington Republicans:</p>
<blockquote><p>But we&#8217;ve learned one thing already: when presented with even a hint of evidence that someone on their team has treated national security with cavalier disdain, conservative concern with national security gets thrown overboard without a second thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin may be right about the “conservatives” at Fox News, the National Review, and the Weekly Standard as well as the Washington Republicans.  Let’s hope the rank-and-file Republicans are more like Larry Johnson.</p>

                                <p>The gold bugs over at the National Review have been arguing against letting the yuan float.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/pegged_to_an_ol.html">Mark Thoma</a> provides one review of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200507221419.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> as Mark points to Milton Friedman as a proponent of currency stability.  Friedman is also seen as a proponent of floating exchange rates and his recent comments point out that fixed exchange rate are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for low and stable inflation rates.  </p>
<p>Kudlow was reflecting on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/business/worldbusiness/22assess.html">Saying Goodbye to Mr. Greenspan</a> by Keith Bradsher:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bradsher also writes that China’s tight peg of the yuan to the dollar, which has been the case for more than a decade, generated “impressive stability [that] helped prompt business executives and entrepreneurs from around the world to invest $60 billion a year in new factories and other operations in China. These investors were confident that they knew what those businesses and their exports would be worth in dollars.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have previously expressed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/exporting-gold-bugs-to-china.html">my doubts</a> that the Chinese Central Bank has been following the lead of Mr. Greenspan, but read the <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6620&#038;ID=12">China Monetary Policy Report: 2003</a> and judge for yourself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Broad money M2 grew by 19.6 percent to RMB22.1 trillion yuan at the end of 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow seems to be suggesting that a fixed exchange rate regime leads to less business risk.  Friedman’s point seems to be akin to saying that nominal exchange rate certainty is not the same a real exchange rate certainty.  I would suspect most financial economists would further argue that real exchange rate variability plays at best a modest role in accessing the overall systematic risk facing any particular enterprise.  Given the opening of international markets and the low cost of labor in China, one might wonder why there is not much more foreign investment in China as high expected returns would tend to compensate for a modest amount of systematic risk.  Of course, one could argue that there are substantial political risks in investing in enterprises in the People’s Republic of China.  </p>
<p>If Kudlow thinks $60 billion of investment is a substantial contributor to China’s growth rate, I’d suggest he compare this figure to China’s overall economy and investment.  <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ch.html#Econ">This source</a>, for example, puts China’s GDP at $7262 billion and its overall investment at 46% of GDP.  Foreign investment is therefore about 2% of total investment.  Furthermore, China is running a current accounts surplus, which means China’s national savings exceeds its domestic investment.  In other words, China is doing more investment in foreign assets than foreigners are investing in Chinese assets.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200507260859.asp">John Tamny</a> suggests that dollar devaluations have historically not increased U.S. net exports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, conventional wisdom 20 years ago argued that a weaker dollar would reduce Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S., and along the lines of Ip’s thinking, push the “global economy closer toward balance.” The “experts” in the ’80s hadn’t done their homework. Just as major dollar devaluation in the 1970s failed to reduce our trade deficit, the deflation forced on Japan in 1985 similarly failed to reduce our trade “imbalance” &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s remember that the period from 1985 to 1989 was one of strong economic growth for the U.S. (in my view, reversing the weak aggregate demand growth during the first half of the 1980’s) so it is not surprising that import demand continued to rise.  What Tamny fails to mention is the fact that export demand growth was also very high.  As shares of GDP, exports were 7.2% of U.S. income in 1985 as opposed to an import share equal to 9.9%.  He is correct to suggest that the import share rose over the next two years faster than the export share with imports being 10.8% of GDP and exports being 7.7% of GDP.  The import share rose to 10.8% by 1989, while the export share rose to 9.2%.  In other words, net exports did increase by 1989.  </p>
<p>But Tamny has to support the National Review’s gold bug drive by misrepresenting what the evidence says.  </p>

Gonzalez had trouble with Bob Scheiffer’s questions on Face the Nation:</p>
<blockquote><p>SCHIEFFER: Let me just ask you the obvious question, Mr. Attorney General. Did you tell anybody at the White House, get ready for this, here it comes?<br />GONZALES: I, I told one person, ah, in, in the White House of, of the notification, and, and <br />SCHIEFFER: Who?<br />GONZALES: and immediately &#8211; ah, I told the chief of staff. And immediately the next morning, I told the President and, shortly thereafter, there was a notification sent out to all the members of the White House staff. </p></blockquote>
<p>While Gonzales claims the Justice Department gave him permission for this delay, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/07/25/gonzales-excuse">Thinkprogress</a> also points out that Karl Rove’s friend John Aschroft headed the Justice Department at that time and did not recuse himself from PlameGate until at the end of the year.  </p>
<p><strong>So why didn’t President Bush make sure that a special prosecutor was appointed on July 15, 2003? </strong></p>

One line which puzzled our readers was:</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor compensation is growing above a 7 percent annual rate while aggregate hours worked are rising at a rate consistent with 4 percent real GDP growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Forgive me for thinking that Mr. Darda was referring to the growth compensation per hour as he was also touting how the number of hours grew.  Our readers are smart enough to realize that the nominal growth rate in total compensation has been nowhere near 7% per year – and it does seem that Mr. Darda was not referring to compensation per hour after all.  I would say that it would help if the NRO econopundits were clear with their definitions and their sources of data, but then I’d be forgetting the essential ingredient for getting Rich Lowry to allow one to publish at NRO – which is that one is supposed to present distortions to their readers.  </p>
<p>Looking at BEA’s <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N"> Table 1.12: National Income by Type of Income</a>, it does turn out that nominal labor compensation is rising by around 7% per year, but why would anyone compare this nominal growth to the growth rate of real GDP?  Does Mr. Darda not realize that inflation is above zero?</p>
<p>Our chart shows the ratio of labor compensation to national income since 1998.  Our readers know that the labor share of income has fallen.  I guess Mr. Lowry and his econopundits don’t want NRO readers to know this.</p>

                                <p>As Greenspan <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/greenspan-highlight-reel.html">discussed at length</a> earlier this week in his semi-annual report to Congress, economists still have no clear-cut explanation for the “conundrum” (or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/greenspan-on-interest-rate-mystery.html"><em>Interest Rate Mystery</em></a>, as I like to call it) of stubbornly low long-term interest rates in the US.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&#8217;s because there really is no conundrum.  Perhaps the US’s surprisingly low long-term rates are actually not that low.  Perhaps US interest rates have indeed been pushed up in the past year, as many economists have been predicting they would.  Perhaps the expected rise in long-term rates in the US has simply been masked by a simultaneous world-wide fall in interest rates.</p>
<p>Put another way: perhaps the only reason we haven’t seen more obvious signs of long-term interest rates rising in the US is that there has simultaneously been a worldwide downward trend in interest rates that has offset such a rise.  The behavior of interest rates last week in the wake of China&#8217;s revaluation (which I discussed in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/interest-rates-and-renminbi.html">previous post</a>) provides one small example of this larger trend.</p>
<p>The following chart illustrates.  It shows long-term interest rates (measured by the yield on the 10-year government bond) in several countries over the past year and a half.  All around the world, long-term interest rates have clearly trended down for the past year or so – except in the US (represented by the heavy black line), where they have stubbornly remained in the range of 4.0%-4.5%.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials1.jpg"><br /> Note: the series for Germany/France is an average of interest rates for Germany and France, used because their interest rates are extremely close (within 5-7 basis points throughout this time period).  July rates are taken as the average interest rate for the middle two weeks in July.</p>
<p>The following table provides more details about this divergence between interest rate behavior in the US and the rest of the world.  The first column shows by how much long-term interest rates have fallen since January 2004, thus corresponding to the changes between the starting and ending points in the chart above.  With the single exception of Japan, all of the non-US countries have enjoyed a fall in long-term interest rates of between 0.5%-1.0% since early 2004.  US long-term rates, on the other hand, are virtually unchanged.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials2.jpg"></p>
<p>The second column shows the average interest rate differential between each of the countries listed and the US from 2000 to 2003.  For example, the government bonds of France and Germany typically paid an interest rate around 0.1%-0.2% lower than the equivalent US government bond, while Canadian government bond yields were typically about 0.7% higher than US yields through the first four years of this decade.</p>
<p>Yet the final column shows that currently all of the countries in this sample, again with the exception of Japan, have seen the yield on their government bonds fall &#8211; in most cases, quite substantially &#8211; relative to the long-term interest rate that the US government must pay to borrow money.  Even Canadian bonds, which have typically had to pay significantly higher yields than US bonds, are now enjoying lower interest rates than equivalent US bonds. </p>
<p>So while long-term interest rates have generally been trending downward around the world over the past year or so, the US has missed out on this global fall in interest rates.  Put another way, the US has enjoyed the global fall in interest rates, but it has only served to counteract other forces that have been simultaneously driving long-term rates up in the US, so that the net result is that long-term interest rates in the US have remained stable for quite some time now.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the “conundrum” may need to be rephrased.  Instead of wondering why long-term interest rates in the US have stayed so low, we need to answer the following two questions: (1) What is behind the seemingly global decline in interest rates of the past year or so; and (2) Why has the US missed out on this fall in interest rates?  Why are long-term interest rates in the US so high by comparison to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>More on these questions later.</p>

                                <p>Last week when the Chinese central bank first announced that they were going to change the value of their currency against the dollar, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/finally-big-event-china-revalues.html">I suggested</a> that one of the interesting things to keep an eye on would be long-term interest rates in the US. </p>
<p>It turns out that long-term US interest rates did indeed bump up on the day of the announcement, by about 11 or 12 basis points&#8230; only to fall much of the way back down the next day.  As of now, long-term interest rates in the US are very little changed from where they were a week ago.  Apparently the renminbi news had no substantial effect on US interest rates.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story.  </p>
<p>Why do I say that?  Because while rates didn’t rise much in the US as a result of the renminbi revaluation, interest rates in most other countries fell, in most cases quite substantially.  The following table shows the difference between long-term (10-year government bond) interest rates in the US and in several other major developed countries last week.  The table suggests that the Chinese revaluation, which happened on the 21st, apparently had a significant effect on the interest rate differentials between the US and other countries.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials3.jpg"><br />Note: Negative numbers signify interest rates that are lower than US rates.  <br />Source: <em>Financial Times</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, while US interest rates didn’t rise much in absolute terms, the news from China did cause them to rise substantially relative to the rest of the world.  I would argue that this is evidence that China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is indeed having noticeable effects on domestic US interest rates &#8211; just not in the most obvious ways that we might have expected.    </p>
<p>Much more on this in my next post&#8230;</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Your company&#8217;s cash flow was surprisingly strong last quarter.  What do you do?</p>
<p>I can tell you from experience that most managers start spending more.   A new computer system here, a few new hires there, maybe a larger bonus for the executives; more spending is the impulse reaction.   </p>
<p>But some executives are more cautious.  They keep a firm hand on the purse strings while they start asking questions: Why was cash flow above plan?  Will it continue?  And is that new computer system or those potential new hires part of the plan?  Boring?  Maybe.  Good management?  Absolutely.  </p>
<p>And that brings me to this Editorial in the Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/23/AR2005072300742.html">Surpluses and Luck</a>.  It is really the tale of two Governors; Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich of Maryland who is taking credit for his state’s good fortune and is moving to cut taxes, and Gov. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who is setting some of the extra revenues aside.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gov. Ehrlich could learn a lesson from California Gov. Gray Davis&#8217; poor decisions during the stock market boom.  As can be imagined, California&#8217;s revenues soared at the end of the &#8217;90s and Davis responded by cutting taxes and boosting spending.   Then came the bust followed by the broom.  </p>
<p>The Post&#8217;s conclusion draws from a similar experience:<br />
<blockquote>Just a few years ago, at the peak of the high-tech bubble, Maryland enjoyed a $1 billion surplus; when the bubble burst, the surplus rapidly dissolved. As with the tech bubble, no one should expect the current housing boom, which is already showing age, to last forever. When it ends, so will the current jubilation in state capitals and boasts by governors touting their fiscal &#8220;talent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I don&#8217;t know much about Virginia&#8217;s Governor Mark Warner, but I like him already!</p>
