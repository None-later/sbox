<blockquote><strong>US expects Chinese currency revaluation</strong></p>
<p>The Bush administration has told key senators that it expects China to revalue its currency in August ahead of a planned visit to Washington by President Hu Jintao in September, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham, co-sponsors of a bill that would impose a 27.5 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, agreed to delay a vote on their bill after receiving what they regarded as an assurance that China will move on its currency next month.</p>
<p>In a June meeting attended by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, John Snow, Treasury secretary, told the senators that he believed China would allow the value of the renminbi to increase against the dollar in August, the people familiar with the discussion said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The big unanswered questions are: How large will the revaluation be?  By how much will China be able to ease off on its purchases of US securities?  What will happen to US interest rates as a result? What will the effect be on US imports from China?</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, here are my guesses: 10%, not much, a very slight rise, and almost none.</p>

                                <p>The BLS released the June report of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">Producer Price Index</a> this morning.  It confirms what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/falling-inflation.html">yesterday&#8217;s CPI report</a> suggested: inflation in the US seems to have peaked earlier this year (at least for the time being), and may in fact be falling.  From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods showed no change in June, seasonally adjusted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  This index had fallen 0.6 percent in May and risen 0.6 percent in April. </p>
<p>&#8230;Among finished goods, the index for energy goods increased 2.0 percent in June, following a 3.5-percent drop in the previous month.  By contrast, prices for finished consumer foods fell 1.1 percent, compared with a 0.3-percent decline in May, and the index for finished goods other than foods and energy decreased 0.1 percent in June, following a 0.1 percent rise a month earlier.</p>
<p>During the first 6 months of 2005, prices for finished goods advanced at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 2.4 percent, after moving up at a 4.8-percent SAAR during the latter half of 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 12-month change in the core PPI has been falling for five consecutive months now.  </p>
<p>The following chart assembles several of the US&#8217;s most widely-watched inflation measures.  The GDP and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) deflators only go through the first quarter of 2005 right now, but will be updated at the end of the month with the first release of the second-quarter GDP estimate.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/inflation_measures_jun05.jpg"></p>
<p>This leaves us with a series of unanswered questions.  Has this fall in inflation rates been the result of softening demand, or is there another explanation?  If it&#8217;s demand-driven, is it simply another reflection of this spring&#8217;s economic &#8220;soft patch&#8221;, which recent evidence caused some to suggest <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/more_evidence_o.html">may have ended</a> in the past month or two?  If so, does this mean that inflation rates will begin ticking up again this summer?  Or alternatively, is this inflation data circumstantial evidence that the soft patch is continuing, and perhaps the beginning of a more protracted economic downturn?</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the answers to these and other important questions over the next few months&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Furthermore, it’s not just morally wrong for the government to use the estate tax to redistribute wealth, it’s also bad economic policy. Wealth by definition is savings. When savings are confiscated for government use, entrepreneurial opportunities in need of capital go wanting in favor of immediate consumption. </p></blockquote>
<p>Actually – savings represents the flow increase in the stock of wealth over time.  Furthermore, the issue at hand is how the tax burden should be distributed across the population.  Those who are arguing for a restoration of the estate tax are doing so in order to relieve the tax burden on less wealthy individuals.  If Mr. Tamny wishes to complain about increases in government spending, let me suggest he criticized those currently making the appropriation decisions, which are our current GOP leaders he so willingly carries the water for.</p>

                                <p>The latest White House claims about the budget has made Kash one <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/budget-nonsense-from-white-house.html">Angry</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/debunking-white-houses-budget-myths.html">Bear</a> for good reason.  Rather than looking at the recent modest increase in tax revenues (from a rather depressed level), let’s focus on real GDP (figures in 2000$ on an annualized basis) in 2005Q1 ($11096.2 billion) versus where it was in 2000Q4 ($9695.2 billion), that is, 17 quarters ago.   </p>
<p>The White House and its free lunch supply-side supporters want us to believe 3 things: (1) that we have returned to full employment after falling below full employment just as Bush took office; (2) that potential GDP growth has increased since Bush took office; and (3) changes in the growth rate of potential GDP are primarily from changes in tax cuts ala the “work, save, and invest” mechanism.  </p>
<p>The following chart suggests alternative values for potential real GDP based on different assumptions as to the growth rate as well as the (debatable) premise that we were at full employment in 2000Q4.  While I suspect some economists might argue we were still above full employment then, President-elect George Bush was arguing in late 2000 that we were in a recession.  Actually, a fairer read of the GOP claims as the new Administration entered office – as it argued to the 2001 tax cut (memo to the supply-siders: you supported this 2001 tax cut even as you try to deny its existence now) &#8211; might go something like this.  We had gone beyond full employment in early 2000 but the weak aggregate demand growth during the latter half of the year brought us back to full employment – and unless aggregate demand growth was quickly restored to its average 3.5% per year, we would fall below full employment.  </p>
<p>Suppose some non-supply-sider argued that the tax cut had no effect on potential GDP growth with the implication that sustainable growth would be 0.85% per quarter.  In this case, potential GDP would be around $11,196 billion implying a GDP gap near 1%.  With a modest supply-side benefit existed increasing the growth rate to 0.9%, the implication would be that potential GDP today would be $11,291 billion implying a GDP gap of 1.7%.  In other words, it is hard to make both the first and the second claim above coming from the supporters of Bush’s economic policies.  </p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/06/unfinished_busi.html">David Altig</a> argued that we have experienced some negative real business cycle shocks.  Other economists have argued that the declines in the employment-population rate and the average workweek as well as the decline in the investment/GDP ratio may be due to certain negative real business cycle shocks.  In fact, Kash has often noted that the rising cost of providing health care insurance is a negative supply-side shock.  So is it possible that potential real GDP has been growing at only 0.8% per quarter?  Perhaps – but such an admission undermines the third leg of the argument from the supporters of Bush’s economic policies.</p>

<p>The 12-month inflation rate in core (i.e. excluding food and energy &#8211; see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/inflation-measures.html">this post</a> for why we care about that specific measure) consumer prices has now been flat or falling for the past 4 months, while the overall consumer price inflation measure is now showing the smallest 12-month increase in 9 months.  Tomorrow we&#8217;ll get a new Producer Price Index report, which may well show the same thing.  Month by month, I&#8217;m slowly becoming more convinced that the US&#8217;s inflation rate is on a distinct, if gradual, downward trajectory.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The release of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/pdf/06msr.pdf"><em>Mid-Session Review</em></a> of the 2006 budget by the White House today was accompanied by a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2005/factsheet_msr.pdf">press release</a> full of dubious claims.  Each point in the press release contained its own misleading or incorrect spin on the budget.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #1:</strong> <em>&#8220;The Improved Fiscal Outlook Is Directly Tied To The Strength Of The Economy. With the help of tax relief, the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy pace, creating millions of new jobs and increasing business investment.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Of course, it is certainly true that government tax revenues, and thus the country&#8217;s fiscal outlook, depends directly on the strength of the economy.  However, it is an unlikely and unproven claim to assert that the economic recovery was helped by tax relief.</p>
<p>Tax relief probably had little or nothing to do with the growth of the US economy over the past few years.  As the following chart shows, the economy has grown much more slowly under the Bush administration than after the average post-war recession, despite tax cuts in 2001 (the “recession year”) and 2003 (“R +2”).  In fact, the current recovery is no better than the recovery from the 1991 recession, even though that recovery faced more rapid increases in interest rates by the Fed (300 basis points in 18 months, compared to 200 basis points in 18 months during this recovery).  So from this <em>prima fasciae</em> evidence, it’s hard to see that the Bush tax cuts have made any discernable mark on economic growth.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr1-709491.jpg"></p>
<p>What did more sophisticated economic modeling predict for the supply-side effects of the tax cuts?  As I mentioned in the previous post, the best estimate by the Congressional <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/x-105-03.pdf">Joint Committee on Taxation</a> (JCT) in 2003 was that the supply-side boost from the Bush tax cuts may (using optimistic assumptions) increase GDP growth by 0.3% per year for a few years.  Note that this effect was predicted to disappear, or even be reversed, after 2008.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=4454&#038;sequence=0#pt2">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO) published the results of a similar exercise in July 2003, in which they used several different macroeconomic models – specifically incorporating forward-looking supply-side reactions in the economy to the tax cuts – to estimate the growth effects of the tax cuts. Using the assumption that future government spending would be cut to try to balance the budget, five of the six supply-side models they used predicted that the Bush tax cuts would reduce, rather than increase GDP growth.</p>
<p>The economic models thus suggest that it is likely that the Bush tax cuts had a tiny or even negative effect on economic growth.  Judging by actual GDP growth of the past few years, those models seem to have been about right.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #2:</strong> <em>&#8220;Growing Economy Is Producing Greater Than Expected Revenues. The Mid-Session Review projects tax receipts will rise 14 percent from last year – the largest such year-over-year increase in 25 years. Receipts are on pace to rise $87 billion more than expected last February; spending was $7 billion less than expected.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Tax revenues have indeed risen quickly in the past couple of quarters.  But as I illustrated in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/budget-nonsense-from-white-house.html">the previous post</a>, if it weren’t for the Bush tax cuts, they would have grown even more quickly, and erased even more of the budget deficit.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the degree to which this relative improvement in the budget picture is “unexpected” is debatable.  The following table shows the White House’s forecasts for the budget deficit (in billions of $) and GDP growth in 2005 and 2006.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr2-713996.jpg"></p>
<p>Today’s much-trumpeted forecast of the deficit of “only” $333 billion is actually right in line with most of the projections for the 2005 deficit that the White House has made over the past few years, with the exception of the outlier of January 2005.  Meanwhile, today’s forecast for the budget deficit in 2006 does not look like much of an improvement at all over earlier forecasts.  </p>
<p>Based on the White House&#8217;s own forecasts, it&#8217;s hard to see that recent budget news contains any unexpected improvements in economic growth or the budget picture.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIM #3:</strong> <em>&#8220;The Projected Decline In The Deficit Includes Anticipated Costs. The new deficit forecasts take into account full extension of tax relief, war spending in 2005 and a substantial part of 2006, and the expected financing impact from creating voluntary personal retirement accounts under the President’s Social Security reform proposal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>First of all, I find it odd that the White House is so proudly trumpeting the fact that this forecasts of the US budget actually &#8220;includes anticipated costs.&#8221;  Isn&#8217;t a budget forecast <em>always</em> supposed to do that?  It&#8217;s sad that this is news.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this budget forecast still fails to include several important and fully anticipated costs.  </p>
<p>First of all, today’s projections assumes that non-defense discretionary spending will grow at between 1.7% and 1.2% in nominal terms (which translates into a cut of about 1% per year in real terms) from now until 2009.  This is despite the fact that such spending has grown by between 5% and 10% every year since 2001.  Even if they just made the optimistic (from a budgetary point of view) estimate that non-defense discretionary spending would grow no faster than inflation, that would add $80 to the budget deficit through 2010.</p>
<p>Secondly, today’s projections assume just $37 billion in expenses for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006, $10 billion in 2007, and virtually zero thereafter.  By contrast, the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6067&#038;sequence=0">CBO estimated</a> that continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, even with a gradual withdrawal or US troops from that part of the world, would cost $50-$80bn per year through 2008, and over $25 billion per year thereafter.</p>
<p>Thirdly, today’s projections assume that nothing is done to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a problem that nearly all budget-watchers recognize will need to be addressed within the next couple of years.  By ignoring the AMT problem, the White House is again dramatically understating likely future budget deficits &#8211; by some $170 billion over five years, according to the CBO.</p>
<p>If you add these missing &#8220;anticipated costs&#8221; to the White House estimates of the budget deficit, and put aside the social security surplus to focus on the &#8220;On-budget&#8221; budget balance, you find that there is no significant reduction in the budget deficit in sight, as the following chart illustrates (figures in billions of $).</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/msr3-725057.jpg"></p>
<p>The US government will have to borrow about a half a trillion dollars in 2005 to fund its general operations, and keep borrowing an additional half a trillion dollars each year for the forseeable future.</p>
<p>For some reason, the White House seems to be proud of the budget update that it released today.  But the faulty logic, evidence-free reasoning, and misleading assumptions embodied in it cause me to feel nothing but disappointment about this budget report.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Bush administration has spent much of the past two days <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2005/factsheet_msr.pdf">claiming</a> that the tax cuts are responsible for the recent <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/13/news/economy/budget_deficit.reut/index.htm">surge in government revenues</a>.   </p>
<p>But this is nonsense.  The fact that government tax collections are rising during a time of economic growth is, at the very least, unsurprising.  If the White House wants to take credit for a falling budget deficit, then they need to make the only comparison that really matters, and one that they have been studiously avoiding: what is today’s budget deficit <em>compared to what it would have been without</em> the Bush tax cuts?</p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re unwilling to do so, let’s make that comparison for them.  In fact, since I’m in a generous mood today, let’s suppose for a moment that we gloss over a host of theoretical problems with the argument of the supply-siders (e.g. their evidence-free assumption that substitution effects of tax cuts outweigh income effects) and buy their dubious argument that the tax cuts caused supply-side economic growth.  </p>
<p>Even with such supply-side optimism, the budget deficit today is much higher than it would have been without Bush administration tax policies.</p>
<p>In January of 2003 the Republican Congress stipulated that its own tax specialists, the Joint Committee for Taxation (JCT), must prepare “dynamic” analyses of all tax legislation – i.e. analyses that include supply-side gains that may reduce the tax burden of any tax cut.   We can use these estimates to get at the supply-siders’ best-case scenario for the effect of the Bush tax cuts on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>In December 2003 the <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/x-105-03.pdf">JCT estimated</a> that when supply-side macroeconomic effects of the 2003 tax cuts were taken into consideration, the tax cuts would indeed cause an offsetting revenue gain by stimulating economic activity.  However, they estimated that the positive supply-side effects on the economy would boost real GDP growth by only 0.2-0.3% per year during 2003-08.  They then estimated that this benefit to the economy would mean that the revenue losses from the tax cut were estimated to be only around 75-90% of what they would otherwise be.</p>
<p>The following chart shows what this means for the budget deficit.  The blue bars show the Bush administration’s most recent budget deficit forecast – the one that they were crowing about today.  The orange bars show the budget forecast if the Bush tax cuts had never happened, according to the estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, calculated by simply summing the CBO’s estimates of the revenue effects of each of the Bush tax cuts.  The purple bars show what the budget deficit would have been without the Bush tax cuts, <em>even if you believe the supply-siders</em> and use the JCT&#8217;s “dynamic scoring”, which assumes that without the tax cuts the economy would have grown more slowly. </p>

<p>The White House is proud of the fact that their tax policies have caused the budget deficit forecasts to improve, so that this year’s deficit will be only $333 billion.  Yet without their misguided tax cuts, the budget deficit today would be in the neighborhood of $100 billion instead, and heading toward balance within another two years.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While it has been a while, let me start by thanking Kash for his post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/us-vulnerability-to-china.html">CNOOC bid to buy Unocal</a> as well as his various posts that discuss the benefits of free trade.  The NRO has even featured very good defenses of free trade from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200503021122.asp">William Buckley</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200506290858.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a>.  I was hoping to say the same thing about the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200506241442.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> with his colorful title “The Insanity of Smoot Schumer and Hawley Graham”.  Alas, Kudlow spent more time of this theme:</p>
<blockquote><p>This rhetorical question was asked by economist Arthur Laffer last week in connection to an unprecedented attack on China trade by numerous U.S. senators. In response to the China bashing, the stock market plunged … Art Laffer argues that a stable yuan linked to the dollar has promoted strong economic growth at low inflation for the U.S., China, and the rest of the world … Think of the dollar-link as China’s gold standard … Ironically, since the dollar has been floating freely, the dollar-linked yuan has also floated compared to a market basket of currencies. Between 1995 and 2001 the yuan-dollar appreciated by nearly 50 percent and in recent years has fallen by about 30 percent. Both the U.S. and China adjusted internally to deflation and inflation. But the common link between the two has given the yuan global financial confidence while at the same time giving the U.S. enormous leverage over the Chinese economy. What’s wrong with that? We buy their goods and they invest in our country through the purchase of Treasury bonds and more recently through direct investment in large U.S-based corporations (like Maytag and Unocal). </p></blockquote>
<p>First of all – for all the NRO’s devotion to every word written by Art Laffer, why can’t they identify what Laffer paper they refer to?  Secondly, U.S. monetary policy is neither tied to the price of gold nor should it be.  Perhaps, Kudlow should review these words from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200506240838.asp">John Tamny</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>given the rise in the price of gold from $255 in 2001 to roughly $435 today … from 1996 until 2001 &#8211; a time in which the price of gold plummeted from roughly $385 to $255.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one looks at the bottom right of <a href="http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html">this webpage</a>, one can plot gold prices and see Tamny at least got the data right.  Even though gold prices fell during the late 1990’s, I would not argue that monetary policy should have been more expansionary.  And even though <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/does_the_increa.html">Mark Thoma</a> seems to be more comfortable with recent FED tightening than I am, he is not saying the FED should try to reverse the recent rise in gold prices.  </p>
<p>Kudlow argues that Chinese inflation roughly tracks U.S. inflation.  Reported inflation in China has been less than reported inflation in the U.S. over the past several years per <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2005/01/pdf/statappx.pdf">this IMF report</a>, but one could argue that the official statistics understate Chinese inflation.  The IMF data also shows that China’s monetary growth rates have been double-digit since 1997, which is what one would expect under a fixed exchange rate regime where China has consistently run current account surpluses, while the U.S. has consistently run current account deficits.  </p>
<p>And yet Kudlow’s whole argument seems to be that we should retain the current exchange rate peg.  His claim seems to be that Chinese real GDP growth, which has been in excess of 8% per year since 1997, is due to its pegged exchange rate.  Yet, the IMF also reports that real GDP growth in China averaged 10% per year from 1987 to 1996.  The current exchange rate peg has not been in place for this entire period.  Additionally, fixed exchange rates are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for macroeconomic stability.  While a yuan revaluation might be in order to reduce China’s current account surplus, the impact on U.S. net exports is likely to be quote modest.</p>
