                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On the substance, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200507200913.asp">Deroy Murdock</a> makes two points that I wish his <em>National Review</em> colleagues will notice.  First, he includes interest income in his definition of the Social Security surplus:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fiscal year 2005, for instance, the Social Security system will collect $496.7 billion in payroll taxes, $14 billion in taxation of benefits, and $83.6 billion in congressionally appropriated interest. Of this $594.3 billion bundle, seniors will receive $433.7 in benefits, while $6.5 billion will cover administrative costs. This $154.1 billion balance is the Social Security surplus.</p></blockquote>
<p>He later notes that counting this surplus as an offset to General Fund deficits is Enron accounting:</p>
<blockquote><p>These pieces of paper obligate future Congresses to collect taxes tomorrow to finance Congress’ bipartisan spendaholism today. There are no underlying, marketable assets involved &#8211; just the anticipated political will of future elected officials to shake down citizens who currently populate America’s K-12 classrooms. This is legalized Enron accounting. DeMint, Ryan, and their co-sponsors would end this spectacular fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet as he appropriately calls Bush’s fiscal fiasco (without naming Bush somehow) Enron accounting, he has already engaged in what has to be seen as political absurdity.  The DeMint proposal does nothing to reduce the General Fund deficit.  Mr. Murdock opens his oped with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans are making them an offer they may be unable to refuse: Help the GOP stop raiding the Social Security Trust Fund, or vote to continue Uncle Sam’s biggest swindle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I miss the news last night?  Did John Kerry and Bill Frist switch parties?  Did Bill Thomas and Charles Rangel switch parties?  Have Howard Dean and Ken Mehlman traded positions?  Mr. Murdock might wish to check the consensus between <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/the_good_old_cl.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&#038;refer=columnist_hassett&#038;sid=ai2iE.j8vxno#">Kevin Hassett</a> that Clinton’s fiscal policy was more responsible than the Enron fiscal policies coming from the current Administration.  </p>
<p>If Mr. Murdock chooses to read what Kevin Hassett wrote, he might take delight in Hassett’s claim that Bush’s fiscal fiasco is due to too much spending and not due to a reduction in tax revenues.  But take note that Hassett’s claim is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/more-supply-side-spin-from-kevin.html">pure spin</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/a_day_late_and_.html">Mark Thoma</a> also reviews Murdock’s oped.  Check out the links in Mark’s post for further explanation as to why the DeMint proposal does virtually nothing to address any alleged solvency problem.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s the highlight reel from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2005/july/testimony.htm">Greenspan&#8217;s testimony before Congress</a> today.</p>
<p>First, some comments about the state of the economy thus far in 2005:<br />
<blockquote>In mid-February, when I presented our last report to the Congress, the economy, supported by strong underlying fundamentals, appeared to be on a solid growth path, and those circumstances prevailed through March. </p>
<p>&#8230;The upbeat picture became cloudier this spring, when data on economic activity proved to be weaker than most market participants had anticipated and inflation moved up in response to the jump in world oil prices. By the time of the May FOMC meeting, some evidence suggested that the economy might have been entering a soft patch reminiscent of the middle of last year, perhaps as a result of higher energy costs worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8230;[However,] The data released over the past two months or so accord with the view that the earlier soft readings on the economy were not presaging a more serious slowdown in the pace of activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, comments about the prospects for the rest of this year:<br />
<blockquote>Should the prices of crude oil and natural gas flatten out after their recent run-up&#8211;the forecast currently embedded in futures markets&#8211;the prospects for aggregate demand appear favorable. Household spending&#8211;buoyed by past gains in wealth, ongoing increases in employment and income, and relatively low interest rates&#8211;is likely to continue to expand. Business investment in equipment and software seems to be on a solid upward trajectory&#8230; However, given the comparatively less buoyant growth of many foreign economies and the recent increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, our external sector does not yet seem poised to contribute steadily to U.S. growth.</p>
<p>&#8230;Thus, our baseline outlook for the U.S. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained inflation pressures. In our view, realizing this outcome will require the Federal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation. This generally favorable outlook, however, is attended by some significant uncertainties that warrant careful scrutiny.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now for the things that could go wrong:<br />
<blockquote>With regard to the outlook for inflation, future price performance will be influenced importantly by the trend in unit labor costs, or its equivalent, the ratio of hourly labor compensation to output per hour. Over most of the past several years, the behavior of unit labor costs has been quite subdued. But those costs have turned up of late, and whether the favorable trends of the past few years will be maintained is unclear.</p>
<p>&#8230;Energy prices represent a second major uncertainty in the economic outlook. A further rise could cut materially into private spending and thus damp the rate of economic expansion. In recent weeks, spot prices for crude oil and natural gas have been both high and volatile. Prices for far-future delivery of oil and gas have risen even more markedly than spot prices over the past year. Apparently, market participants now see little prospect of appreciable relief from elevated energy prices for years to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, Greenspan&#8217;s final worry, and the one that he spent the most time discussing: unusually low long-term interest rates:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;The third major uncertainty in the economic outlook relates to the behavior of long-term interest rates&#8230; This decline in long-term rates has occurred against the backdrop of generally firm U.S. economic growth, a continued boost to inflation from higher energy prices, and fiscal pressures associated with the fast approaching retirement of the baby-boom generation. The drop in long-term rates is especially surprising given the increase in the federal funds rate over the same period. Such a pattern is clearly without precedent in our recent experience.</p>
<p>&#8230;Considerable debate remains among analysts as to the nature of those market forces [keeping long-term rates low]. Whatever those forces are, they are surely global, because the decline in long-term interest rates in the past year is even more pronounced in major foreign financial markets than in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8230;Some, but not all, of the decade-long trend decline in that forward yield can be ascribed to expectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less inflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems due to a moderation of the business cycle over the past few decades.</p>
<p>&#8230;In addition to these factors, the trend reduction worldwide in long-term yields surely reflects an excess of intended saving over intended investment. This configuration is equivalent to an excess of the supply of funds relative to the demand for investment. What is unclear is whether the excess is due to a glut of saving or a shortfall of investment&#8230; [A]s best we can judge, both high levels of intended saving and low levels of intended investment have combined to lower real long-term interest rates over the past decade.</p>
<p>&#8230;The economic forces driving the global saving-investment balance have been unfolding over the course of the past decade, so the steepness of the recent decline in long-term dollar yields and the associated distant forward rates suggests that something more may have been at work over the past year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason Greenspan cites unexplainedly low long-term interest rates as a potential risk to the US economy is largely because of what might happen to the housing market if they <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/keeping-eye-on-interest-rates.html">start rising</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he exceptionally low interest rates on ten-year Treasury notes, and hence on home mortgages, have been a major factor in the recent surge of homebuilding, home turnover, and particularly in the steep climb in home prices.</p>
<p>&#8230;Among other indicators, the significant rise in purchases of homes for investment since 2001 seems to have charged some regional markets with speculative fervor.  The apparent froth in housing markets appears to have interacted with evolving practices in mortgage markets.</p>
<p>&#8230;[W]e certainly cannot rule out declines in home prices, especially in some local markets. If declines were to occur, they likely would be accompanied by some economic stress, though the macroeconomic implications need not be substantial.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a fairly upbeat assessment of the state of the US economy, I think, though Greenspan may have spent more time discussing potential macroeconomic concerns than he typically does.  </p>
<p>However, I think that there&#8217;s one big item that he missed when discussing the possible future trajectory of long-term interest rates: the large and endless budget deficits that seem to be in store for the US government, despite the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/debunking-white-houses-budget-myths.html">White House&#8217;s whitewashing attempts</a>.  I&#8217;m guessing that Greenspan would probably be a lot less worried about the potential for a sudden rise in long-term interest rates if the US didn&#8217;t face such serious fiscal problems.  I know that I would (in addition to just about every macroeconomist I know).  Yet he relegated mention of this problem to a footnote, which was probably not read aloud to the Congress.  I think that represents a missed chance to remind Congress of the importance of fiscal prudence, and their failure to exercise it.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I think that it&#8217;s generally worth keeping one eye on long-term interest rates for indications of market expectations and behaviors.  And over the past couple of weeks, this indicator has shown some interesting movement: long-term rates have made a decisive, if not dramatic, move upward. The 10-year yield has gone from about 3.95% to about 4.20% since the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>What does this tell us?  One possibility is that market participants have changed their assessment of future inflation probabilities.  Another is that they have revised their opinions of future economic growth (which creates demand for borrowed funds) in the US.  Yet another possible explanation is that there has been some slight change in the interest of investors around the world to lend money to US borrowers. </p>
<p>The following chart illustrates that a change in inflation expectations can be ruled out.  I think that that leaves options #2 and #3 as the possible explanations for this recent rise in interest rates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/10yr_2005.jpg"><br />Note: Inflation expectations measured as the difference between the 10-year nominal yield and the 10-year TIPS yield.</p>
<p>Who knows if this rise in rates will persist; the bond market&#8217;s penchant for keeping long-term rates surprisingly low has continually surprised many economists over the past year or so.  But it is something worth keeping one eye on.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some background: the unemployment rate is only one of several numbers economists use to assess the jobs picture. When the economy is generating an abundance of jobs, economists expect to see strong growth in the payrolls reported by employers and in the number of people who say they have jobs, together with a rise in the length of the average workweek. They also expect to see wage gains well in excess of inflation, as employers compete to attract workers.In fact, we see none of these things. As Berkeley&#8217;s J. Bradford DeLong writes on his influential economics blog, &#8220;We have four of five indicators telling us that the state of the job market is not that good and only one &#8211; the unemployment rate &#8211; reading green.&#8221;In particular, even the most favorable measures show that employment growth has lagged well behind population growth over the past four years. Yet the measured unemployment rate isn&#8217;t much higher than it was in early 2001. How is that possible?The answer, according to the survey used to estimate the unemployment rate, is a decline in labor force participation. Nonworking Americans aren&#8217;t considered unemployed unless they are actively looking for work, and hence counted as part of the labor force. And a large number of people have, for some reason, dropped out of the official labor force.Those with a downbeat view of the jobs picture argue that the low reported unemployment rate is a statistical illusion, that there are millions of Americans who would be looking for jobs if more jobs were available. Those with an upbeat view argue that labor force participation has fallen for reasons that have nothing to do with job availability &#8211; for example, young adults, recognizing the importance of education, may have chosen to stay in school longer.That&#8217;s where Dr. Bradbury&#8217;s study comes in. She shows that the upbeat view doesn&#8217;t hold up in the face of a careful examination of the numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/07/index.html#000363">Bill Polley</a> has additional insights.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.wanniski.com/PrintPage.asp?TextID=4501">Jude Wanniski</a> claims to have solved the Dropout Puzzle (hat tip to AB reader JP).  If Mr. Wanniski wrote this piece a little more sensibly, I might argue that it was a nice discussion of real business cycle theory.  But he is too eager to declare lower employment to be clearly a good thing and his claim that he predicted a decline in the employment to population ratio strikes me as absurd.  Why?  Doesn’t Mr. Wanniski keep telling us that reductions in tax rates increase employment and output?  </p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Wanniski at least offers one theoretical explanation for his claim &#8211; an assertion that increases in investment will lead to a higher capital to labor ratio and higher real wages.  But there are two problems with his new theory: (1) it contradicts his usual notion that substitution effects dominate income effects; and more importantly (2) real wages have been falling &#8211; perhaps because investment demand is still weak.</p>

                                <p>My hope in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/job-growth-housing-price-increases.html">this post</a> was to stimulate further debate as to what Martin Wolk had written about Ben Bernanke’s claim about a relationship between job growth and housing price increases.  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/07/bernanke-job-growth-and-home-prices.html">CalculatedRisk</a> read the data in the same way that Wolk read it, while <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/07/factchecking_th.html#more">James Hamilton</a> ran a regression with employment growth as the explanatory variable.  He finds that employment growth can explain 17% of the increase in housing prices, which leaves 83% of the variability of housing price changes unexplained.  Of course, Bernanke had noted that changes in other fundamentals are at play so it is not surprising that this single factor regression leaves most of the changes in housing prices to other factors.  Hamilton concludes by saying the following statement may be reasonable:</p>
<blockquote><p>While speculative behavior appears to be surfacing in some local markets, strong economic fundamentals are contributing importantly to the housing boom.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement may be reasonable, but a single factor regression that explains only 17% of the observed variability is not going to settle the debate as to whether there is a speculative bubble in the housing market.</p>

Mark notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I disagree with his demonstration that tax cuts paid for themselves and that therefore the deficit is attributable solely to spending, not to tax cuts. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a look at what Hassett wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s tune out the chatter for a minute and just do the math. One easy way to gain perspective is to compare the situation before Bush took office with today. At the beginning of 1999, the Congressional Budget Office made (as it does every year) a 10-year projection of revenue and expenditures for the years 2000 through 2009. Since then, a number of policies have changed and the economy has surprised us. How well did the budget office do in its 2000 projections for 2006? How far are we from where we expected to be? The numbers are startling. First, let&#8217;s look at revenue. In the 2000 forecast, the budget office expected that the U.S. Treasury would collect $2.39 trillion in 2006. In its latest forecast, it projects that revenue will be $2.21 trillion, an error of only $180 billion. </p></blockquote>
<p>Two points: (1) a forecast of $180 billion per year is large; and (2) Hassett has to go back to a forecast two years before Bush took office to make his claim.  Hassett continues with this claim about real GDP:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gap is so small because economic growth surprised on the upside, delivering more revenue after the tax cuts than was expected. Supply-siders can rightly point to this as partial vindication.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hassett is trying to get us to believe that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts led to faster than expected growth.  Given the weak real GDP growth during Bush’s first term, I went back to see what the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=1059&#038;sequence=1">CBO</a> was forecasting in early 1999.  The real GDP forecast from table 2 is compared to actual real GDP growth below.  </p>

<p>Note in particular how conservative these forecasts were.  In fact, real GDP growth for 1998 was higher than what CBO had forecasted it would be in early 1999.  Real growth for 1999 and 2000 was substantially higher than what CBO forecasted.  Even with these conservative forecasts for 2001 and 2002, the very weak growth rates were below the 1999 CBO forecast.  While it is true that real GDP growth was moderately strong in 2004, this growth was what one would have expected for in a Keynesian recovery – and not evidence for a supply-side effect.  </p>
<p>To give you an analogy to how Hassett has been mining the data to cook out some spurious claim, consider the following analogy.  Imagine you had consulted Donald Luskin as an investment advisor in January 2000 as to what might be a hot stock tip.  Of course, you would likely not be so foolish but then <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/">Mark Kleiman</a> confused Donald Luskin with Karl Rove’s attorney (see Parsing the Morison Case).  In my analogy, your investment advisor convinced you to purpose shares of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CSCO&#038;t=my">Cisco Systems</a>.  Let’s also assume that you recently complained that your advisor’s advice in early 2000 yielded significant portfolio losses.  It would be like Luskin – or even Hassett – to compare how Cisco has done in the last five years relative to how it was doing in 1995.  But then you did not buy the stock in 1995.  In a similar vein, one cannot argue that real GDP is higher today than what we were led to believe would have happened when President Bush made his case for the 2001 tax cut.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Mark Kleiman has now corrected his identification of Rove&#8217;s attorney as the name now reads &#8220;Robert Luskin&#8221;.  If you have not already, check out Mark&#8217;s blog for some excellent coverage of the legal angles of PlameGate.</p>

                                <p>Irwin Kellner of Marketwatch picks up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/measuring-inflation-difficulties-posed.html">the question that I posed last week</a> of how inflation in house prices affects official inflation data.  He takes the reasoning that I suggested &#8212; that when house prices and rents diverge, the CPI may not give as good a picture of the cost-of-living as we would like (see <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/do_rising_house.html">these comments</a> by David Altig and Mark Bryan for more on the subject) &#8212; a bit further:</p>
<blockquote><p>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BE202A003-65E2-445C-AAA0-68510C5712B6%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; The faster the increase in home prices, the slower the rise in the consumer price index.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, the CPI is being held down by the method that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate the housing component of this key index. </p>
<p>&#8230;[I]n today&#8217;s topsy-turvy world&#8230; the faster home prices rise, the slower the increase in rents. In some locales, rents have actually declined.</p>
<p>The reason is not hard to fathom. With interest rates as low as they are, people would rather buy than rent. That&#8217;s why the percentage of households that own their homes has jumped from 64 percent 10 years ago to 69 percent today.</p>
<p>As the demand for owning goes up, the demand for renting goes down. This pushes prices for homes higher even as it holds down their rental equivalent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m very skeptical that there&#8217;s actually a <em>negative</em> correlation between house prices and rents as Kellner suggests, in anything more than a few isolated instances in the past couple of years.  But I do agree with him that when house prices and rents do happen to diverge (as they have in recent years) then that raises questions about the accuracy of the CPI as a measure of cost-of-living increases.</p>

You may recall that his first excuse for the <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20030714.shtml">7/14/2003</a> column by Robert Novak was the premise that it was common knowledge that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent.  But now Mr. May claims we could not have known that she was a CIA agent until one read the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&#038;pid=823">7/16/2003</a> column from David Corn.  Given that Mr. Corn simply told his readers what Mr. Novak had written, I assume Mr. May is simply making some sort of weird joke.</p>

<blockquote><p>For example, states exhibiting higher rates of job growth also tend to have experienced greater appreciation in house prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The AP story on Bernanke’s comments can be found <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8552401">here</a>.  Wolk argues that job growth alone cannot explain housing appreciation adding that other fundamental factors may be at play – as well as an element of speculation.</p>
