                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Yet another thing that Katrina has done this week is to highlight some stark differences in what people believe about the world and the appropriate role for government.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Katrina has grimly reminded us of this fact of life: sometimes bad things happen to good people, through no fault of their own.  Sometimes people just get unlucky.</p>
<p>Liberal versus Conservative Beliefs About the World</p>
<p>Liberals like me tend to believe that when that happens, our society as a whole will be better off if the rest of us try to help out those individuals who have suffered from circumstance.  This doesn&#8217;t mean that we think that we can elimninate suffering, or ensure that nothing bad ever happens, or that we should insulate individuals from the consequences of their own actions.  But when things outside of an individual&#8217;s control devastates their life, we think that it is compassionate and good and just &#8211; and even in our own enlightened self-interest &#8211; to help out.</p>
<p>Most conservatives, on the other hand, tend to believe that society should play a relatively small role in helping people when they&#8217;re down &#8211; the primary responsibility for recovery from bad times rests with the individual and his or her family, not with society in a broader sense.  Perhaps this difference largely springs from the presumption of many conservatives that if an individual is experiencing bad times, it is probably largely a consequence of their own actions, and that they should have to bear full responsibility for their poor choices.</p>
<p>So if I had to encapsulate in a few words why I describe myself as a liberal, I would simply say this: I believe in bad luck.  I think that a huge number of the forces that affect most people&#8217;s lives are outside of their control &#8211; the parents that they were born to, the quality of their local educational opportunities, the management of the company that they happen to work for, the fortunes of the city or town in which they happen to live, or the industry in which they happen to find work &#8211; and that individuals who suffer from a bad family, poor education, being laid off, or a hurricaine, should not be left to live with the consequences of their plain bad luck without help from society at large.</p>
<p>Why Government?</p>
<p>If you believe society should help out those who&#8217;ve drawn a bad lot, one might still wonder why the responsibility for giving them a helping hand should belong to the government, rather than private individuals.</p>
<p>The reason for this actually goes back to economic theory.  One powerful insight that every first-year economics microeconomics student learns is that when something has a positive externality, or is a public good, the provision of that public good by private individuals will be less than each of those individuals would like.  The problem is that such goods suffer from the free-rider problem.  In such cases, society is unambiguously better off if the government provides the public good.</p>
<p>Taking care of society&#8217;s hard-luck cases is just such a public good.  If you help out someone who&#8217;s suffering through no fault of their own, then I benefit, even if I haven&#8217;t contributed toward helping that person in any way.  Our society is made more fair and just and more stable, and I will be able to rest slightly more easy knowing that if it is my turn to suffer the bad luck next time, you have demonstrated that you will help me out.  In fact, everyone in society will benefit from your good works, even though they didn&#8217;t contribute.  And so each of us, even those of us who think that it&#8217;s a good idea to help society&#8217;s bad-luck individuals, will have a strong incentive to be a free-rider.  The result will be an under-provision of good deeds.</p>
<p>The solution is simple, however: let the government take over that responsibility.  That way none of us will free-ride, the provision of help will be increased to its appropriate level, and we will all be better off.</p>
<p>In Practice</p>
<p>So what does this mean in practice?  It means that liberals support government policies that provide help to those who have suffered from the powerful forces that buffet each of our lives but are outside of our control.  As I said, that doesn&#8217;t mean that liberals want to try to completely insulate everyone from anything bad ever happening&#8230; just that when bad stuff happens that individuals have no control over, we think the government should help out a bit.</p>
<p>Most policy differences between Conservatives and Liberals can be seen in this light.  This difference explains why:
<ul>
<li>Liberals believe in a strong and well-run national government that has the resources and organization to provide effective help to the victims of disasters such as Katrina.  Conservatives have planned and executed the down-sizing of such federal government responsibilities.</li>
<li>Liberals disagree with the new bankruptcy law, which has made it financially much harder on individuals who go bankrupt, since we recognize that the vast majority of bankruptcies are due to plain bad luck &#8211; job loss or medical emergencies, in particular.  Thus we think that individuals who face these personal disasters should receive some shelter from the corporations to whom they owe money.   Conservatives apparently believe that the corporations need more financial protection than the hard-luck individual.</li>
<li>Liberals think that government provision of a good education to all people is an important way to help take care of those individuals who happen to be born to the wrong parents or in the wrong part of town.  Conservatives tend to believe that education should be more up to the private sector and the private choices of parents, regardless of the fact that many parents do not have the means or inclination to provide a good education for their children.</li>
<li>Liberals think that the government has an important responsibility in assuring access to health care for all people, whether they are rich or poor, as a way of assuring that all of us will receive the medical help that we need when tragedy strikes.  Conservatives tend to think that the government should have a minimal role in health care &#8211; if you are faced with medical bad luck, you should deal with it on your own.</li>
<li>Liberals believe strongly in progressive taxation, which provides a subtle redistribution of income toward those members of society who have suffered from a bad draw in life.  Conservatives tend to advocate flat taxes, or minimal taxes, both of which minimize the progressive nature of the tax system.</li>
<li>Liberals believe in helping people who are laid off from their job, recognizing that this is typically due to mismanagement or broader industry trends, not due to the failings of the individual worker.  Conservatives tend to believe that when a family suffers financially from a job loss, nearly all of the burden of coping with that loss should fall on that family.</li>
<li>Liberals believe in the social safety net more generally, for example to provide a guaranteed income to the elderly in the form of a stable and sure Social Security system, so that all of our senior citizens can count on a certain income level regardless of the luck that they face.  Conservatives want to have the welfare of the elderly depend more on their good or bad choices, and &#8211; more realistically &#8211; their good or bad luck.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on with this list, but I&#8217;m sure that you can fill in additional items yourself.  My point is that nearly all policy divides between liberals and conservatives contain a strong element of the philosophical divide that I described above: that liberals tend to believe that people often suffer due to forces outside of their control, and that when that happens the government should help out; while conservatives think that the government should play a minimal role in helping those who have fallen on hard times.</p>
<p>Katrina provides a horrible but effective illustration of this difference in action.</p>

                                <p>Not because I&#8217;m thinking much about it today, but because I feel like I should at least mention it: the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">August employment report</a> was released by the BLS this morning.  </p>
<p>From the report:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000 in August, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 4.9 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Employment rose over the month in several industries, including construction, health care, and accommodations  and food services.  Manufacturing employment edged down in August.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, it seems that this report was consistent with what we&#8217;ve gotten used to lately: moderate, rather than robust, job growth; stagnant or very slightly rising hourly pay and hours worked; and a stubbornly slow rise in labor force participation, which remains at relatively low levels.</p>

                                <p>One of the most basic reasons why we have a government is for the reason articulated by Thomas Hobbes over 350 years ago: without government, we would be in a “state of nature” in which there are: “no arts, no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</p>
<p>Impossible as it would have been to believe just a week ago, New Orleans in the past few days has devolved to just such a Hobbesian state of nature.  People have expressed shock and surprise that violence and chaos have erupted in New Orleans this week.  But it should really come as no surprise; the local government in New Orleans is disabled and overwhelmed, and our national government is (for reasons unclear to me) simply not there.  As Hobbes pointed out, a return to the state of nature is exactly what we should expect when government is absent.  </p>
<p>There are many good reasons that we have governments, including but not limited to Hobbes&#8217; reason. That&#8217;s why we agree to pay the taxes that support them.  But this week, in the United States, our government has failed to fulfill one of it most basic duties to tens or hundreds of thousands of its citizens.  Disgraceful does not begin to describe it.</p>

                                <p>Before I return to the RBC debate, let’s all pray that <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9156612">FEMA</a> picks the pace.  Our prayers all with the Gulf Coast residents and we know our nation can do better.  </p>
<p>Back on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/08/labor-market-woes-keynesian-v-real_21.html">August 21</a>, I should have led with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I should mention one problem with my fourth and favorite real business cycle suggestion, which is the fact that productivity seems to continue to rise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems to – did I say.  Well, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/08/department_of_h.html">Brad DeLong</a> graphs the continuing increases in productivity and then asks “Huh” in reference to Robert Hall’s explanation of the 2001 recession.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma has added some <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/08/the_shortrun_an.html">interesting discussions</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/guest_post_char.html">links</a> to <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2005/09/charlie_bean_to.html">New Economist</a> who notes that measuring the Keynesian output gap may be a difficult exercise and then notes a reply to Hall from Charles Bean that argues that we have been below full employment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, given current technology, there is always some degree of uncertainty in our gap measure even if it is a theoretically sound principle. </p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect Arthur Okun had similar sentiments when he devised his rule of thumb known as Okun’s Law.  </p>
<p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/08/more_on_the_lab.html">David Altig</a> kindly replies to some of my musings, but alas I think he missed my point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Health insurance is the largest single component of employee benefit expenditures.  For a given total amount of compensation, increasing payments in the form of more insurance expenditure means less in other forms &#8211; including wages.  Whether we get more or less for those higher insurance expenditures is an interesting and important question, as is the question of whether the tax code is introducing welfare-degrading means of compensating workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, there are three issues embedded in this passage.  One issue involves how one measures the cost of living.  Kash has argued that the apparent rise in real compensation raises the price index problem as workers are not getting more in the form of fringe benefits even if employers are paying more.  What I was trying to concede to David – who is still convinced the weakness in the labor market is not a sign of Keynesian disequilibrium – was that the Kash effect is a form of an RBC effect.  But let me add one more complaint to the massive confusion known as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/seriously-wall-street-journal.html">Stephen Moore</a>.  As AB notes, the WSJ correction stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fringe benefits have exploded in recent years because benefits are tax free to employees, but wages are taxed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As AB notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Benefits have been tax free to employees, and wages have not, for as long as I can remember. So the ongoing taxability (to the employee) of wages but not benefits simply cannot explain why wage growth has been flat in the last 4 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the tax effect does not pass muster, the Kash effect does.  But I’m still not convinced that market clearing models can fully explain why the employment to population ratio remains below 63%.</p>

<blockquote>Huge crowds, hoping to finally escape the stifling confines of the stadium, jammed the main concourse outside the dome, spilling out over the ramp to the Hyatt hotel next door &#8212; a seething sea of tense, unhappy, people packed shoulder-to-shoulder up to the barricades where heavily armed National Guardsmen stood.</p>
<p>&#8230;At least seven bodies were scattered outside, and hungry, desperate people who were tired of waiting broke through the steel doors to a food service entrance and began pushing out pallets of water and juice and whatever else they could find.</p>
<p>An old man in a chaise lounge lay dead in a grassy median as hungry babies wailed around him. Around the corner, an elderly woman lay dead in her wheelchair, covered up by a blanket, and another body lay beside her wrapped in a sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t treat my dog like that,&#8221; 47-year-old Daniel Edwards said as he pointed at the woman in the wheelchair. &#8220;I buried my dog.&#8221; He added: &#8220;You can do everything for other countries but you can&#8217;t do nothing for your own people. You can go overseas with the military but you can&#8217;t get them down here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Katrina-Gas-Prices-HK3.html?hp&#038;ex=1125633600&#038;en=b73f1f85933ea56e&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">around the country</a>: <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Out of Gas&#8221; signs and yellow caution tape were draped across pumps in parts of the United States early Thursday after many retailers were overrun by panicked motorists looking to top off their tanks as prices soared past $3 per gallon and reports of shortages spread.</p>
<p>Gas stations in and around downtown Atlanta had temporarily run out of gas. The same was reported elsewhere, including parts of North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Arizona. Many retailers who did have gas had no clue when their next shipments would come in.</p></blockquote>
<p>These do not sound like stories written about the United States&#8230;</p>

<p>As usual, my preferred way of looking at this data is at the level of local (i.e. metropolitan area) markets.  The following two charts present a sampling of house prices in some major metropolitan markets in recent years, including today&#8217;s most recent data.  </p>
<p>The first chart shows prices in markets that have been appreciating rapidly for quite some time.  The rapid price appreciation of the past few years in those markets showed little or no signs of abating this spring.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ofheo1.jpg"></p>
<p>The next chart shows a small selection of the many metropolitan markets that did not experience such enormous price increases during the first part of this decade.  However, many of those markets that missed out on the first part of the house price boom now seem to be joining the bandwagon.  One after another, markets outside of California and the Northeast are now also beginning to experience rapid house price appreciation.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ofheo2.jpg"></p>
<p>One interesting question that this raises is the following: when the appreciation does indeed finally come to an end in the big markets of California and the Northeast, will the lagging markets in the rest of the country keep appreciating?</p>

                                <p>Personal consumption spending in July was high.  Very high.  In fact, people spent considerably more than they earned, so the personal savings rate in July was negative: -0.6% of disposable income, to be precise.  That means that, for only the second time in the past several decades (the first was in October 2001), households as a group were reducing their net savings position (abstracting from capital gains and losses).  From the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrelarchive/2005/pi0705.htm">Commerce Department</a> this morning:<br />
<blockquote>Personal income increased $29.3 billion, or 0.3 percent, and disposable personal income (DPI) increased $27.2 billion, or 0.3 percent, in July, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $85.7 billion, or 1.0 percent.</p>
<p>&#8230;Personal saving &#8212; DPI less personal outlays &#8212; was a negative $58.8 billion in July, in contrast to a positive $0.9 billion in June.  The negative personal saving reflects personal outlays that exceed disposable personal income.  Saving from current income may be near zero or negative when outlays are financed by borrowing (including borrowing financed through credit cards or home equity loans), by selling investments or other assets, or by using savings from previous periods.</p></blockquote>
<p>For fun, here&#8217;s a chart showing the US savings rate (3 month moving average) over the past 20 years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/savings2.jpg"></p>
<p>The current rate of spending growth by consumers is unsustainable without substantial and immediate increases in income growth, or continued substantial increases in household wealth due to asset appreciation.  Since it&#8217;s hard to see where an increase in income growth rates will come from right now, and it seems likely that housing price appreciation is nearing a peak in many markets, my guess is that the growth of consumer spending will have to slow.  </p>

<blockquote>George W. Bush gave one of the worst speeches of his life yesterday, especially given the level of national distress and the need for words of consolation and wisdom. In what seems to be a ritual in this administration, the president appeared a day later than he was needed. He then read an address of a quality more appropriate for an Arbor Day celebration: a long laundry list of pounds of ice, generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast. He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help should send cash, grinned, and promised that everything would work out in the end&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The WSJ really does have great news coverage, but man is their editorial team dragging the whole paper&#8217;s reputation into the ground. <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/08/its_a_close_rac.html">Via Brad DeLong</a>, Stephen Moore (former Club for Growth president and now &#8220;a member of The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s editorial board&#8221;) actually <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112527218346525075,00.html?mod=article-outset-box">wrote this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The explosion of benefits paid to workers is in large part an artifact of the federal tax code, which allows employers to deduct from taxes pensions, health care, child care, and the like, but not wages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Stephen Moore wrote that employers cannot deduct wages from their taxable income. And no one with any authority at the WSJ &#8212; the world&#8217;s leading business news publication &#8212; noticed the mistake! This editorial was Moore&#8217;s feeble attempt to explain, in his own words, &#8220;Why have wages only crept up since 2000 during this era of unprecedented productivity gains? [Ed. note: I&#8217;m also not sure that the productivity gains since 2000 are &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; but I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.]&#8221;</p>
<p>Deciding to double-down on mendacity (alert readers will recall that I was recently in Las Vegas), the WSJ issued <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/corrections?page=Corrections">this correction</a>:<br />
<blockquote>THE AUG. 27 feature, &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112527218346525075,00.html?mod=article-outset-box">The Wages of Prosperity</a>,&#8221; by Stephen Moore mistakenly reported that wages are not tax deductible to employers. The relevant sentence should have said, &#8220;Fringe benefits have exploded in recent years because benefits are tax free to employees, but wages are taxed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The corrected wording doesn&#8217;t pass muster as an explanation for flat wage growth, either. Benefits have been tax free to employees, and wages have not, for as long as I can remember. So the ongoing taxability (to the employee) of wages but not benefits simply cannot explain why wage growth has been flat in the last 4 years.</p>
