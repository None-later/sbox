                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Charles Schumer is my hero.  I&#8217;m starting to think that he may be one of the most intelligent and articulate senators that we have.</p>
<p>Sorry for the length of the following transcript excerpt; I couldn&#8217;t resist. From yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/14/AR2005091402308.html">confirmation hearings</a> :<br />
<blockquote>SCHUMER: [L]et me ask you this about judges in general. You sit on a court, correct?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: Yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: OK. And sometimes you dissent. And that&#8217;s routine, not just for you but for every judge&#8230;</p>
<p>SCHUMER: And every justice on the Supreme Court has dissented in many cases; meaning they disagreed with the opinion of the court, right? And nothing is wrong with that? There is nothing improper, nothing unethical?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to commentators. Non-judges are free to criticize and disagree with Supreme Court cases. Correct?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: Yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: In speeches, law review articles, it&#8217;s a healthy process, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: I agree with that. Yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: And you did this occasionally when you were in private practice?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: Yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: OK. Nothing unseemingly about that?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: No.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: OK. And how about lawyers representing clients? Lawyers representing clients criticize cases and legal briefs all the time. That&#8217;s what they do for a living.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s part of being a good lawyer.</p>
<p>And you signed your name to briefs explicitly criticizing and disagreeing with Supreme Court decisions?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: On occasion, yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: In Rust v. Sullivan, for example, your brief said that, quote, &#8220;Roe was wrongly decided and should be overturned,&#8221; unquote. Right?</p>
<p>ROBERTS: Yes.</p>
<p>SCHUMER: OK. But in this hearing room, you don&#8217;t want to criticize or disagree with any decided cases? That seems strange to me. It seems strange, I think, to the American people that you can&#8217;t talk about decided cases &#8212; past cases, not future cases &#8212; when you&#8217;ve been nominated to the most important job in the federal judiciary.</p>
<p>You could do it when you worked in the White House, you could do it when you worked in the Justice Department, you could do it when you worked in private practice, you could do it when you gave speeches and lectures; as a sitting judge, you&#8217;ve done it until very recently. You could probably do it before you just walked into this hearing room.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re confirmed, you may be doing it for 30 years on the Supreme Court. But the only place and time that you cannot criticize any cases of the Supreme Court is in this hearing room &#8212; when it is more important than at any other time that the American people, and we the senators, understand your views.</p>
<p>&#8230;[Y]our failure to answer questions is confounding me. You&#8217;ve done it in instance after instance after instance after instance.</p>
<p>What is the difference between giving your views here in this hearing room and what judges do every day, what professors do every day, what lawyers do every day?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>SCHUMER: Let me just say, sir, in all due respect &#8212; and I respect your intelligence and your career and your family &#8212; this process is getting a little more absurd the further we move.</p>
<p>You agree we should be finding out your philosophy and method of legal reasoning, modesty, stability, but when we try to find out what modesty and stability mean, what your philosophy means, we don&#8217;t get any answers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if I asked you: What kind of movies do you like? Tell me two or three good movies. And you say, &#8220;I like movies with good acting. I like movies with good directing. I like movies with good cinematography.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I ask you, &#8220;No, give me an example of a good movie.&#8221; You don&#8217;t name one. I say, &#8220;Give me an example of a bad movie.&#8221; You won&#8217;t name one. Then I ask you if you like &#8220;Casablanca,&#8221; and you respond by saying, &#8220;Lots of people like &#8216;Casablanca.'&#8221;</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any strong opinions about Roberts, and I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s conservative or Ultra Super-Duper Conservative.  And since this confirmation process seems to add just about nothing to our knowledge of Roberts, none of us (except Roberts) will know until he&#8217;s been on the court for a while&#8230;</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050914-120153-3878r.htm">Washington Times</a> notes that DeLay declares victory in war on budget fat:<br />
<blockquote>House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said yesterday that Republicans have done so well in cutting spending that he declared an &#8220;ongoing victory,&#8221; and said there is simply no fat left to cut in the federal budget. Mr. DeLay was defending Republicans&#8217; choice to borrow money and add to this year&#8217;s expected $331 billion deficit to pay for Hurricane Katrina relief. Some Republicans have said Congress should make cuts in other areas, but Mr. DeLay said that doesn&#8217;t seem possible. &#8220;My answer to those that want to offset the spending is sure, bring me the offsets, I&#8217;ll be glad to do it. But nobody has been able to come up with any yet,&#8221; the Texas Republican told reporters at his weekly briefing. Asked if that meant the government was running at peak efficiency, Mr. DeLay said, &#8220;Yes, after 11 years of Republican majority we&#8217;ve pared it down pretty good.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect that had John Kerry been President, his Treasury might be closer to the positions held by Congressman Jeff Flake or even American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene. But let’s get real – we are not about to significantly reduce the massive Federal budget deficit with spending cuts alone.  Does this mean Congressman DeLay is conceding the obvious point – the Bush tax “cuts” are merely tax deferrals?</p>

                                <p>The Federal Reserve reported today on industrial production and capacity utilization.  From <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/Current/default.htm">the report</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Industrial production rose 0.1 percent in August, and at 119.7 percent of its 1997 average, was 3.1 percent above its year-earlier level. Manufacturing output increased 0.3 percent; excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing production was unchanged from July. The output at mines declined 0.6 percent, and the output at utilities decreased 0.5 percent. Hurricane Katrina severely curtailed output in the Gulf Coast region at the end of August; hurricane-related production declines were most evident in oil and gas extraction, industrial chemicals manufacturing, and petroleum refining. Overall, the rate of change in total industrial production in August was reduced by an estimated 0.3 percentage point because of disruptions related to the hurricane. Capacity utilization for total industry was 79.8 percent, a rate that is 1.5 percentage points above its year-earlier level but 1.2 percentage points below its 1972-2004 average.</p></blockquote>
<p>The industrial side of the economy has been steadily recovering from its slump of 2001-03, though as the release points out, the US economy is still running at substantially below its typical level of capacity utilization.  More worryingly, recent advances in capacity utilization seem to have recently been petering out.</p>
<p>This brings us once again back to the unresolved question of the summer: how much slack is left in this economy?  Or, put another way, how much more production can we get out of this economy before significant price pressures start being felt?  </p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, even the reasonably good recovery in industrial production of the past couple of years has left the US economy using just under 80% of its total industrial capacity, which is substantially below its historical &#8220;full&#8221; capacity of 82-83%.  The chart also illustrates that the US economy&#8217;s utilization of its labor force has recovered by even less.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/slack_measures2.jpg"></p>
<p>So while this is an economy that is probably in the mature phase of its economic expansion (an expansion that has been ongoing for almost 4 years now), the economy has still failed to get into full swing.  Since different measures give different answers, it is unclear exactly how much slack remains in the economy&#8230; but nearly all measures still suggest that we have some way to go before we&#8217;ve fully recovered from the 2001 recession.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050912-mon.html">Stephen Roach</a> thinks that long-term interest rates in the US are nearly as low as they will get, primarily because everyone in the US seems to be borrowing rather than saving:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he US saving outlook has just taken a worrisome turn for the worse.  That wouldn’t be so bad if America started from a position of strength on the saving front.  But, of course, that is not the case.  America’s net national saving rate has averaged only 1.5% since early 2002 &#8212; a record low and literally one-fifth the 40-year average of 7.5% recorded over the 1960 to 2000 time period.  Moreover &#8212; and here’s the kicker for the bond market &#8212; in looking out over the next few years, the outlook is now deteriorating for all three major components of domestic US saving &#8212; for consumers, the government sector, and Corporate America.</p>
<p>&#8230;But there is a new source of concern: Courtesy of Hurricane Katrina, a saving-short US economy may be entering a new era of vulnerability.  The outlook for US fiscal policy is especially worrisome in this regard.  The political repercussions of this devastating storm cannot be minimized.  With the impacts underscoring some of America’s most glaring disparities &#8212; economic, social, and ethnic &#8212; politicians of both major parties are opting to spend their way out of the blame game.  For a federal budget deficit that was supposed to come in at -2.4% of GDP in fiscal 2006, a conservative estimate of post-Katrina spending could easily push that figure into the -3.25% to -3.5% range &#8212; virtually identical to peak cyclical shortfalls hit in 2003-04.  With margins of slack narrowing, the timing of this fiscal impetus could not be any worse.  Moreover, it is occurring in a context when private sector saving is at a record low &#8212; effectively putting the US in the uncomfortable position of having to ask its foreign creditors to pick up the tab for repair and reconstruction of the Gulf Coast.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point that Roach makes here is an important one: if we now expect a budget deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2006, with a growing economy, what can we expect when the next recession strikes &#8211; perhaps as soon as 2006 or 2007?  Recessions always cause a significant widening in budget deficits&#8230; but since we will be starting the next recession with a deficit of 3.5% of GDP, that means that we could soon be looking at budget deficits of 5% of GDP or more.  Not a pleasant prospect.</p>

                                <p>I must confess that I&#8217;ve spent relatively little time thinking about or paying attention to the Roberts confirmation process.  I think that&#8217;s probably largely a function of the fact that there&#8217;s almost no suspense; unless it comes out that Roberts eats puppy dogs for breakfast, or maybe masterminded an identity-theft operation for the mob, there&#8217;s virtually no chance that he will not be confirmed as the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point of the hearings?  For Republicans, the point is simple: keep the hearings as short and sweet as possible, so that any possible puppy-eating behavior doesn&#8217;t have the chance to come to light.  But what about for Democrats?  Given that they have virtually no chance to stop the nomination, is there any reason for them to put more than a respectable amount of time and energy into questioning Roberts?</p>
<p>I can only think of one reason, though it might be an important one: to set the stage for the next nomination, the one that will replace O&#8217;Connor.  If they can establish that Roberts is very conservative (if indeed he is), and make that publicly and well known, then perhaps that will help public pressure build for a more moderate replacement for O&#8217;Connor.  Alternatively, if they can generate a close vote (close would be less than 55 in favor, I think), then that might send a signal that Roberts is as conservative as a successful nominee can be.  </p>
<p>But on the other hand, will any of this really make any difference in Bush&#8217;s next nomination?  Probably not.  Hence my shameful lack of interest in the proceedings.</p>

                                <p>The short term supply of gasoline remains tenuous.  The NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/business/11refine.html">reports</a> today:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;&#8230; four major refineries &#8230; are either flooded or without power, and are likely to be out of commission for several weeks, perhaps months. Together, these refine 880,000 barrels a day, or 5 percent of domestic capacity.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>  And, according to the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/050911/gas_prices.html?.v=2">Lundberg Survey</a>, gasoline prices are already at record levels in both nominal and real terms:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;Damage to Gulf Coast refineries and pipelines by Hurricane Katrina pushed retail gas prices to historic highs in the past two weeks, with self-serve regular averaging more than $3 a gallon for the first time ever, according to a nationwide survey released Sunday&#8230;.<br />The weighted average price for all three grades surged more than 38 cents to nearly $3.04 a gallon [eclipsing] the nation&#8217;s previous high weighted average for all three grades [adjusted for inflation of] $3.03 in current dollars.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Several actions have been taken to meet demand without even higher prices: 1) draw down existing stocks of gasoline, 2) import more refined products and, 3) the White House has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2005/09/07/afx2212071.html">asked</a> oil companies to postpone refinery maintenance.  All of these solutions are short term and carry significant risks.</p>
<p>According to the DOE, <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/twip/twip_gasoline.html#stocks">existing stocks</a> of gasoline are already below the normal range for this time of year.  See the following graph:</p>

<p>Drawing down gasoline stocks too far carries the risk of prolonging the period of record gas prices.  Importing refined products reduces the supply elsewhere, especially in Europe.  <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15952732&#038;method=full&#038;siteid=66633&#038;headline=katrina-threat-to-eu-economies--name_page.html">According</a> to the Daily Record, UK&#8217;s Gordon Brown warned yesterday that &#8216;Hurricane Katrina could sweep Europe into recession&#8217;.  And postponing maintenance carries the risk of accidents and further disruptions.  The NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/business/11refine.html">reports</a> that refineries were already running at 95% of capacity before Hurricane Katrina:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;&#8230; a level that is dangerously high and that has led to a growing number of accidents in recent years.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>  There is some good news on the demand side, as the DOE reported demand for gasoline dropped 4% for the last week.  Both <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/09/demand_curves_d.html">Dr. Polley</a> and <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/09/gasoline_demand.html">The Big Picture</a> commented on this.  However, there can be significant variability in the week to week DOE data. In fact there have been at least four times since early 2004 that the week to week demand dropped or increased by 5% or more without any clear explanation.  Hopefully the drop in demand will continue.</p>
<p>Where does this leave the US?  It is critical that the four &#8216;out of commission&#8217; refineries return to operation as soon as possible.  But even more important, the US needs to reduce demand for gasoline consistently, by 5% or more, until the refineries are back in operation.  Perhaps the record high prices will suffice, but I believe this is a situation that calls for leadership &#8211; something sorely lacking in the US &#8211; and a call for conservation on the part of all Americans for the next few weeks or months (and why not years?).</p>

                                <p>In his comments to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/employee-stock-options-and-how-irs.html">this post</a>, Jeffrey Miller points us to an excellent discussion from <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/09/issue/review_cisco.0.asp">Roger Lowenstein</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But as Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett have observed, they aren&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221; in an economic sense. Like other forms of compensation, options bear a cost to the corporation. But what is that cost? … Academics have been devising formulas to value stock options for decades; the creators of the Black-Scholes formula, the first such attempt to be widely adopted, won a Nobel Prize … Black-Scholes was developed for plain vanilla options that trade on exchanges. Employee options cannot be bought or sold, and under certain conditions (if the employee quits or is fired, for instance) they are cancelable. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that such options are worth less than vanilla. But how much less? Cisco&#8217;s solution would delight Adam Smith. Instead of using a formula to derive a value, the company plans to issue new derivatives, similar to the options granted to its employees, and to sell these derivatives to willing buyers. The price that the buyers pay would represent the true &#8220;cost&#8221; of the employee options.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lowenstein properly notes that we are talking the market price at the time the option is granted – as the value of an option can change over time.  <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3870/is_11_19/ai_107802501">Tim Reason</a> was confused as to this point as we noted on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/archives/2004_06_01_angrybear_archive.html">June 8, 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He then notes a statement from Kim Boylan, counsel to the International Employee Stock Options Coalition, also suggesting this evidence indicates problems with the SFAS 123 estimated value. But does this difference in the estimated value in 2002 versus the market price in late 2003 represent a concern that the SFAS 123 footnote seriously overstated the true value of the ESO or is this simply a reflection of the change in the value of Microsoft’s ESOs over this period? Using reasonable assumptions, a Black-Scholes model would predict a decline in value for these options near 80%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lowenstein continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cisco intends to sell the warrants in an auction, but the auction would probably be open only to a dozen or so institutional bidders, which Cisco (or perhaps Morgan Stanley) would preselect. This has raised concerns. Since when did limiting the number of potential bidders lead to the most accurate price? What&#8217;s more, the fact that the warrants could not be traded will presumably greatly limit the demand for them. &#8220;You are talking about a very idiosyncratic contract,&#8221; notes Myron Scholes, one of Black-Scholes&#8217;s Nobel laureate creators. &#8220;The Cisco management team must know a lot more about HR [human resources] at Cisco than the outside investors. Due to that, [investors] would probably insist on a large discount.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to Jeffrey for providing Lowenstein’s discussion.</p>

                                <p>It seems if one has White House <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/10/katrina.contracts.reut/index.html">connections</a>, one may receive reconstruction contracts:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; Companies with ties to the Bush White House and the former head of FEMA are clinching some of the administration&#8217;s first disaster relief and reconstruction contracts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  At least two major corporate clients of lobbyist Joe Allbaugh, President Bush&#8217;s former campaign manager and a former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have already been tapped to start recovery work along the battered Gulf Coast. One is Shaw Group Inc. and the other is Halliburton Co. subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root. Vice President Dick Cheney is a former head of Halliburton.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess taxpayers might take cheer that Bush issued this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/08/news/economy/katrina_wages.reut/index.htm">executive order</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; President Bush issued an executive order Thursday allowing federal contractors rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to pay below the prevailing wage. In a notice to Congress, Bush said the hurricane had caused &#8220;a national emergency&#8221; that permits him to take such action under the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act in ravaged areas of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. The Davis-Bacon law requires federal contractors to pay workers at least the prevailing wages in the area where the work is conducted. It applies to federally funded construction projects such as highways and bridges. Bush&#8217;s executive order suspends the requirements of the Davis-Bacon law for designated areas hit by the storm. </p></blockquote>
<p>In his very good coverage of the FEMA foul-up and how the Bush White House can even abuse tragedy to push partisan wedge issues, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_09/007081.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>Remember back in October of 2002, when George Bush took a careful look at the Department of Homeland Security — an organization originally proposed by Democrats — and tried to figure out how he could gin up some pre-election Democratic opposition to creating it. His answer was to insert a bit of strategic union busting into the DHS bill, something that he knew no Democrat could possibly support. Voila! Democrats opposed the bill and the president accused them of not caring about national security. That was good for a pickup of two seats in the Senate. Fast forward to September 2005. What would be a good way of trying to gin up some Democratic opposition to reconstruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin cites this suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act and provides this note for the math challenged:<br />
<blockquote>$9 an hour is about $18,000 a year. The prevailing wage wasn&#8217;t about to create any new millionaires on the Gulf Coast.</p></blockquote>
<p>This believer in markets, however, has one question.  If Federal contractors pay less than $9 an hour, how will they attract skilled construction workers?  Hopefully, the demand for construction workers will be such that wages rise beyond what the Davis-Bacon Act would require.  But then I’m assuming that this Administration actually tries to do a better job in rebuilding New Orleans than they did during the first few days following Katrina.</p>

<blockquote>Let’s call it Bowyer’s Law: The emphasis that the mainstream media give to unemployment while a Republican is in the White House is directly proportional to the rate of unemployment. In other words, if the unemployment rate is very low, then coverage of the unemployment rate will be very low too — that is, when someone like George W. Bush is in power. At a current rate of 4.9 percent, Bowyer’s Law seems to be holding. It’s time for the Bush administration to turn this thing around. We are currently within a hair’s breadth of achieving 5 million new jobs since the president’s tax cuts were fully implemented in May 2003. If we hit it this month, that would mean 5 million jobs in 28 months. When the new jobs numbers are reported four weeks from now, maybe it will be time for the administration to crow a little bit. </p></blockquote>
<p>Bowyer tops this off with one of his meaningless charts, but this spin does remind me that I’ve been remiss at diagramming the most recent news per the employment-population ratio as well as the labor force participation rate.  And yes, both are up a little bit.</p>

                                <p>This seems to be the message from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200509090833.asp">John Tamny</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Majority Leader Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) has promised to hold a vote on the estate tax as soon as possible. Those presently suffering in Louisiana and Mississippi should hope he does, and that the Republicans also have the courage to make permanent the 2003 Bush tax cuts. Despite warnings from the left, economic growth is the single best cure for what ails Mississippi and Louisiana.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamny tries to suggest that Tyler Cowen believes in the NRO free lunch supply-side spin:<br />
<blockquote>A common misconception about the rebirth of Germany and Japan post-WWII is that aid under the U.S. Marshall Plan led the recoveries in each nation. In truth, according to a study by George Mason professor Tyler Cowen, the “German Miracle” actually began with tax cuts, before money from the United States arrived. </p></blockquote>
<p>Does someone have a link to Tyler Cowen’s actual paper?  The best reference I’ve found to it has this <a href="http://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html">summary</a>: <br />
<blockquote>A study by George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen found that rapid economic growth in countries that had been occupied by Germany during the war occurred &#8220;irrespective of the timing and extent of Marshall Plan aid.&#8221; In West Germany—the plan&#8217;s most often cited success because of the subsequent &#8220;German Miracle&#8221;—economic recovery began before aid started flowing and coincided with Ludwig Erhard&#8217;s elimination of many of the Allied Control Commission&#8217;s extensive restrictions on trade, production, prices and distribution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relaxing restrictions on trade are not the same thing as repealing the Estate Tax.  I hope even Mr. Tamny knows the difference.</p>
