                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Will Katrina really have a substantial negative impact on the US economy, or will its effects be minor and transitory?  This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4367203">Buttonwood</a> column gives both arguments:<br />
<blockquote>Supplies of oil and petrol are being released from emergency stocks, some limited refining is resuming in the Gulf of Mexico, and the price of crude has retreated from last week’s record nominal level. The first murmurs from Lloyds of London suggest that insured losses are likely to be manageable, and that the general firming of rates which will follow could be good for business. The betting in the futures markets is that the Fed will raise rates only once more this year, if that. Plenty of people point out that the reconstruction effort will in time produce an upward blip in economic activity. On this reading, the biggest casualty from the worst natural disaster in America’s history may prove to be not its economy but its president.</p>
<p>But we cannot rely on this sanguine interpretation of the situation. High oil prices were already beginning to slow growth around the world and now American production has taken a huge hit. Consumers filling their tanks with petrol at $3 a gallon would have begun cutting back on other purchases anyway. Thanks to Katrina, a million of them have reportedly lost their jobs and will hardly be splashing out at Wal-Mart. And as long as the ports of New Orleans is out of action, it will be hard to move grains and soybeans south, and coal and coffee north, along the Mississippi. Risk Management Solutions, a consultancy, estimates that the economic loss from Hurricane Katrina, one way and another, will top $100 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buttonwood goes on to write that what really worries her are the risks that the financial system may be facing, thanks to its very large imbalances and the finance industry&#8217;s clever ways of shifting, distributing, and perhaps hiding risk.</p>
<p>Obviously, no one yet knows what Katrina&#8217;s impact will eventually be.  But I will stick by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/08/katrina-and-psychology.html">my earlier argument</a> that if the economy does seem to soften in coming months, Katrina&#8217;s contribution to the economic weakness will have been primarily psychological, not physical or financial.</p>

                                <p>So I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400032717/qid=1125980558/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0857148-4073505?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846">The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-Time</a> in the airport (it&#8217;s a story of the adventures of what to my inexperienced eye seems to be a high-functioning autistic teenager). Having enjoyed it thoroughly, I passed it on to Honey Bear, (btw, now my fiance&#8217;!). Her response, other than also liking the book, was to highlight the following passage for me:<br />
<blockquote>[Protagonist speaking] And I realize that I told a lie in Chapter 13 because I said &#8220;I cannot tell jokes,&#8221; because I do know 3 jokes that I can tell and I understand and one of them is about a cow&#8230;</p>
<p>And this is the joke.</p>
<p>There are three men on a train. One of them is an economist and one of them is a logician and one of them is a mathematician. And they have just crossed the border into Scotland (I don&#8217;t know why they are going to Scotland) and they see a brown cow standing in a field from the window of the train (and the cow is standing parallel to the train).</p>
<p>And the economist says, &#8220;Look, the cows in Scotland are brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the logician says, &#8220;No. there are cows in Scotland of which one at least is brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the mathematician says, &#8220;No. there is at least one cow in Scotland, of which one side appears to be brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is funny because economists are not real scientists, and because logicians think more clearly, but mathematicians are best. </p></blockquote>

<p>But then he is only objecting to those who blame the Bush Administration.  Check out how Bush’s favorite lapdog carries the water for him and <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_09_04_corner-archive.asp#075515">attacks</a> the local government including the police (the 4:02 PM post).  </p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Lowry.  Being the President’s attack dog is really ugly.  Too bad the National Review is more concerned that protecting an incompetent Administration than demanding a faster and more effective effort to save lives.</p>

<blockquote>Gov. Bill Owens, once touted in conservative Republican circles as presidential material, teamed with Democrats last spring in drawing up the proposals that will ask voters to give up as much as $3.7 billion in tax refunds over the next five years. This from a politician who used to tout the state constitutional amendment that limits how much Colorado governments can tax and spend &#8211; the very amendment that would essentially be put on hold if the twin ballot measures pass November 1.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Even <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_09_04_corner-archive.asp#075381">Jonah Goldberg</a> understands that blaming the New Orleans poor for their lack of resources to flee the path of Katrina is misplaced:</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly less obvious that more first responders etc, would have made an enormous difference in the aftermath of this unfolding calamity. The disaster zone after 9/11 was less than 40 square blocks. Rescue vehicles shot straight down Broadway, Fifth Avenue, the West Side Highway etc. The disaster zone, as the President mentioned, is the size of Great Britain. Would relief vehicles have made it to the center of Ground Zero on 9/11 immediately if the rim of the disaster area was deep inside New England? All of the truly damnable mistakes were made before Katrina hit land. Why weren&#8217;t more people evacuated? for example. Such mistakes are legion and fall disproportionately at the state and local level. And whatever criticism I stil think is valid for the President, the hysteria about how Bush doesn&#8217;t &#8220;care&#8221; about black people is as stupid as it is disgusting.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that Goldberg is playing the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/blaming-local-authorities.html">blame local authorities</a> game. Kash is right that 1500 police and a hundred local buses was not enough.  Goldberg seems to be confused on the geography of New Orleans as its port status allows alternatives to simply evacuating by land.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9166337/page/4">MSNBC</a> reports that FEMA had discussed this matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>But other officials said they warned well before Monday about what could happen. For years, said another senior FEMA official, he had sat at meetings where plans were discussed to send evacuees to the Superdome. &#8220;We used to stare at each other and say, &#8216;This is the plan? Are you really using the Superdome?&#8217; People used to say, what if there is water around it? They didn&#8217;t have an alternative,&#8221; he recalled. In the run-up to the current crisis, Allbaugh said he knew &#8220;for a fact&#8221; that officials at FEMA and other federal agencies had requested that New Orleans issue a mandatory evacuation order earlier than Sunday morning. But DHS did not ask the U.S. military to assist in pre-hurricane evacuation efforts, despite well-known estimates that a major hurricane would cause levees in New Orleans to fail. In an interview, the general charged with operations for the military&#8217;s Northern Command said such a request to help with the evacuation &#8220;did not come our way.&#8221; &#8220;At the point that we were all watching the evacuation and the clogged Interstate 10 going to the west on Sunday, we were watching the storm very carefully,&#8221; Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe said. &#8220;At that time, it was a Category 5 storm and we knew that it would be among the worst storms to ever hit the United States. . . . I knew there was an excellent chance of flooding.&#8221; Others who went out of their way to offer help were turned down, such as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, who told reporters his city had offered emergency, medical and technical help as early as last Sunday to FEMA but was turned down. Only a single tank truck was requested, Daley said. Red tape kept the American Ambulance Association from sending 300 emergency vehicles from Florida to the flood zone, according to former senator John Breaux (D-La.) They were told to get permission from the General Services Administration. &#8220;GSA said they had to have FEMA ask for it,&#8221; Breaux told CNN. &#8220;As a result they weren&#8217;t sent.&#8221; Federal authorities say there is blame enough to go around. In a news conference yesterday, Chertoff cautioned against &#8220;finger-pointing&#8221; and said no one had been equipped to handle what amounted to two simultaneous disasters &#8212; the hurricane and subsequent levee break.</p></blockquote>
<p>As far as the levee matter, Chertoff’s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9179790">Meet the Press</a> appearance to whine about the blame game and he engaged in blaming everyone except himself had this in response to Russert’s levee question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I think if you look at what actually happened, I remember on Tuesday morning picking up newspapers and I saw headlines, &#8220;New Orleans Dodged The Bullet,&#8221; because if you recall the storm moved to the east and then continued on and appeared to pass with considerable damage but nothing worse.  It was on Tuesday that the levee&#8211;may have been overnight Monday to Tuesday&#8211;that the levee started to break. </p></blockquote>
<p>When I heard this, I had to wonder what kind of brain-dead engineer forgot to tell him the continuing rush of water could still break the levees.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_09/007050.php">Kevin Drum</a>, however, notes that the Army Corp of Engineers knew of the levee break on Monday morning. </p>
<p>As far as the Convention Center and the lack of food and water, Chertoff said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We became aware of the fact at some point that people began to go to the Convention Center on their own, spontaneously, in order to shelter there.  And I think it&#8217;s for that reason that people found themselves without food and water and supplies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odd – even the President knew people were told to go to the Convention Center, which is why the President assumed these people were getting food and water.  Is Mr. Chertoff flat out lying or is he really this clueless?  Either way – it’s time to replace him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/04/times.picayune.editorial/index.html">The Times-Picayune</a> blames the Federal government and notes that New Orleans has many avenues for aid to come in:<br />
<blockquote>Bienville built New Orleans where he built it for one main reason: It&#8217;s accessible. The city between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain was easy to reach in 1718. How much easier it is to access in 2005 now that there are interstates and bridges, airports and helipads, cruise ships, barges, buses and diesel-powered trucks. Despite the city&#8217;s multiple points of entry, our nation&#8217;s bureaucrats spent days after last week&#8217;s hurricane wringing their hands, lamenting the fact that they could neither rescue the city&#8217;s stranded victims nor bring them food, water and medical supplies. Meanwhile there were journalists, including some who work for The Times-Picayune, going in and out of the city via the Crescent City Connection. On Thursday morning, that crew saw a caravan of 13 Wal-Mart tractor trailers headed into town to bring food, water and supplies to a dying city. Television reporters were doing live reports from downtown New Orleans streets. Harry Connick Jr. brought in some aid Thursday, and his efforts were the focus of a &#8220;Today&#8221; show story Friday morning. Yet, the people trained to protect our nation, the people whose job it is to quickly bring in aid were absent. Those who should have been deploying troops were singing a sad song about how our city was impossible to reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only does Jonah Goldberg need to buy a map – it seems those running FEMA also need geography lessons.</p>

                                <p>Yes, I agree that there&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around.  I&#8217;m sure that local authorities made some poor or slow decisions.  But the Bush administration&#8217;s new <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/finally-plan.html">coordinated</a> effort to blame local authorities for the hundreds or thousands of deaths that have happened in Katrina&#8217;s wake is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/04/AR2005090401337.html">despicable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In public statements and even more bluntly behind the scenes, Bush administration officials have questioned local efforts to rescue thousands of people who were stranded for days without food, water and shelter, resulting in death of an unknown number of Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>But in addition to just being despicable, this attempted line of blame-shifting is nonsensical. </p>
<p>Think about it for a moment.  The rescue effort now involves tens of thousands of military personnel, and even with that massive influx of manpower the process is still taking days.  How many police officers did New Orleans have?  A total of just 1500.  Similarly, moving the estimated 100,000 people in New Orleans who did not have a car would have required at least 2,000 buses.  Yet the city of New Orleans possessed just a few hundred.  Obviously there were more buses in outlying communities, but of course those communities also had their own people to move, so that doesn&#8217;t help much.  </p>
<p>My point is simple: even if all local resources had miraculously survived the hurricane intact, and were used to maximum effectiveness (I don&#8217;t know if they were or weren&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s irrelevant) there&#8217;s no way that those resources would have been able to deal with Katrina by themselves, either before or after the storm.  Attributing the disastrous response to Katrina to inadequate efforts by local authorities seems fairly ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason that the federal government has a long history of being the primary responder to major disasters even when they only have a local impact &#8211; local governments simply do not have the resources.</p>

                                <p>The Bush administration has finally put together a plan to deal with the Katrina crisis, reports the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/05/national/nationalspecial/05bush.html">New York Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>White House Enacts a Plan to Ease Political Damage</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 &#8211; Under the command of President Bush&#8217;s two senior political advisers, the White House rolled out a plan this weekend to contain the political damage from the administration&#8217;s response to Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>[The administration] orchestrated visits by cabinet members to the region, leading up to an extraordinary return visit by Mr. Bush planned for Monday, directed administration officials not to respond to attacks from Democrats on the relief efforts, and sought to move the blame for the slow response to Louisiana state officials, according to Republicans familiar with the White House plan.</p>
<p>The effort is being directed by Mr. Bush&#8217;s chief political adviser, Karl Rove, and his communications director, Dan Bartlett. </p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m relieved.  I&#8217;m glad that the Bush administration is now taking firm action to get the government response to Katrina more organized.  And under Rove&#8217;s expert leadership, I&#8217;m sure that the administration response to Katrina will now be efficiently managed.</p>

                                <p>People needed help on Tuesday not this weekend.  Help was slow in coming and criticism of our government was well deserved.  Yet, folks like <a href="http://frum.nationalreview.com/archives/09022005.asp#075132">David Frum</a> “criticize the criticism”, which for those who may have forget was what the Taliban spokesperson whined after 9/11.  Maybe you don’t agree with me that David Frum has zero principles.  Maybe you think we should be totally focused on getting aid to the needy – to which I agree.  </p>
<p>But please read what <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/01.html#a4740">Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_09/007042.php">Kevin Drum</a> have to say about how our government has totally failed in what is it’s important mission.  Stop the excuses and get to work!  American can do better.</p>

                                <p>We awaked this Saturday to see the good news &#8211; help has arrived to New Orleans.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9174806/site/newsweek">Eleanor Clift</a> provides one explanation of why it took so long for the Federal government to get its act together:<br />
<blockquote>This has been a colossal failure of government. President Bush spent Tuesday, the day after Katrina struck, at a Medicare event in Arizona and then he made his way to a San Diego naval base for yet another anniversary tribute to the Greatest Generation. His concession to reality was adding a few words of compassion to his prepared remarks. Meanwhile, the greatest natural disaster in a century was unfolding at sickening speed with television cameras capturing footage of looting reminiscent of the days after the invasion of Iraq. Things were so bad “you almost wonder if Donald Rumsfeld is in charge,” said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst with the Democratic Leadership Council.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair to the DoD Secretary, he is heading to the region and it seems the Army is doing much of what FEMA should have been doing days ago.</p>

                                <p>The NRO econopundits are contradicting themselves once again on monetary policy.  While <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/canto200509020857.asp">Victor Canto</a> is arguing for a commodity price rule, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200509020858.asp">John Tamny</a> seems upset that the market does not decide the money supply.  And the funny part is that these two probably don’t even understand that their positions are inconsistent.</p>
