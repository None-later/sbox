                                <p>A few conservatives are rightfully concerned that the massive General Fund deficit, which is still above $500 billion a year, is too high and are turning on the Bush Administration.  The <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/editorial/editors200509231145.asp">National Review</a> naturally thinks spending is too high and blames Democrats who must be someone making the Republican led government be so irresponsible: </p>
<blockquote><p>We all know the litany that got us to this point: Bush has never vetoed a congressional spending bill, even as Congress has agreed to fund an estimated 14,000 pork projects, up from around 1,000 in 1996; he has presided over a federal spending increase of 33 percent since 2001, with 55 percent of the increase in the last two years unrelated to defense, according to Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation; and he created a new entitlement, signing a $500 billion prescription-drug bill. Conservatives could just manage to swallow all this, when there was the prospect of Social Security reform changing the politics of the nation&#8217;s most important entitlement … A repeal of the prescription-drug bill &#8211; which we opposed at the time of its passage &#8211; is unlikely to happen and would be demagogued by Democrats as paying for Katrina on the backs of the ailing elderly. But President Bush must endorse a serious, realistic set of budget offsets, and the most promising area is corporate welfare.  But President Bush must endorse a serious, realistic set of budget offsets, and the most promising area is corporate welfare. It doesn&#8217;t have a natural base of support, and cuts in it will be much harder for Democrats to oppose. Republicans should have taken it on long ago. Now is a perfect moment. According to the RSC, eliminating corporate welfare would cut $5 billion in 2006 and $50 billion over ten years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s excuse the fact that NRO must be unaware of the fact that the Social Security Trust Fund is actually running surpluses so slashing this program will not reduce the General Fund deficit unless we slash benefits while maintaining the payroll tax at current levels.  After all, NRO has identified something I can agree with even if it addresses about 1% of the issue.  </p>
<p>Senator Hutchison was on the talk shows asking us not to take what I called <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/luskin-moore-katrina-was-not-that-bad.html">Option Six</a>, which would be for the government to do nothing in the Katrina-Rita relief efforts.  So which one of Kash’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/memo-to-congress.html">five options</a> did she endorse.  Not only did she rule out tax increases, she ruled out reducing defense spending, mandatory spending, and even domestic discretionary spending when asked about specifics.  At several points, she was honest enough to say she did not know where we should cut spending, but she also suggested we defer some of our capital investment projects.  Let’s put aside the obvious criticism that we should not defer rebuilding the levees or improving the highways in light of how people had to cope with Katrina and Rita.  I’d rather focus on the fact that the deficit is really a long-term issue.  Deferring spending rather than reducing it or finding taxes to pay for it is more akin to Enron accounting than it is fiscal responsibility.  So in a way, the Senator was advocating Kash’s Option Five – having future generations pay for the Katrina-Rita cleanup and a whole lot more.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: While the best that <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20050926.shtml">Robert Novak</a> has to offer in the way of spending cuts is delaying highway construction and the implementation of Bush’s massive Rx legislation (note deferrals not long-term spending reductions), here is his take on increasing tax revenues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The beleaguered conservatives see all this spending leading inexorably to a tax increase, which would redistribute the tax burden to the disadvantage of the successful and threaten an economic recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin with addressing the economic illiteracy of Mr. Novak?  Let’s see, deficit financing is an increase in taxes over the long-term even if the actual payments to the Treasury are deferred.  As far as Mr. Novak’s fear that a Keynesian recession might emerge from having the “successful” (aka rich) pay more in taxes, let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/reducing_govern.html">Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s said again and again, and this is the latest example, that we can’t raise taxes because that might hurt the economy’s recovery from Katrina and now Rita, so we will have to cut programs to pay for the spending instead. How is it that cutting government spending doesn’t reduce aggregate demand and GDP and hurt the economy in the same way as raising taxes? … Arguments about long-run economic growth and tax rates are being mixed up with arguments about the level of GDP in the short-run. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mark’s point about “arguments about long-run economic growth and tax rates are being mixed up with arguments about the level of GDP in the short-run” is exactly right, but Novak has been mixed up on economics for decades.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Buy or Rent?  That is the question.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, three economists compared buying and renting as part of reaching a conclusion that there is no housing bubble: <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/research/staff_reports/sr218.pdf">Assessing High House Prices: Bubbles, Fundamentals, and Misperceptions</a>.  Dr. Thoma presents a couple of rebuttals: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/housing_bubble__1.html">Housing Bubble or Housing Froth?</a></p>
<p>And two recent articles gave specific examples of the buy vs. rent decision, from the New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/realestate/25cov.html">Is It Better to Buy or Rent?</a> and the San Francisco Chronicle: <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/25/INGAUERPKR1.DTL">Why own when you can rent?</a></p>
<p>Using one of the examples from the NY Times article, I&#8217;d like to illustrate the basic difficulty with this approach.  The NYTimes article has an example of a home in the Bay Area that can be purchased for $1 Million and an equivalent home that could be rented for $2500 per month.  The various costs of ownership are tallied, minus any tax benefits and compared to the cost of renting.</p>
<p>Assuming a 5 year ownership period, I repeated these calculations (my results differ slightly from the NYTimes).  For the homebuyer, the Net Present Value (2005 dollars) of 5 years of shelter is: $254K.  For the renter, the NPV of costs is $98K.</p>
<p>NOTE: The cost of renting is reduced by income from the retained downpayment, as per the NY Times example.</p>
<p>So why does anyone buy with a 5 year ownership horizon?</p>
<p>For homeownership to make financial sense, the difference between the cost of buying and renting (adjusted to 2010 values) is the amount the property must appreciate (plus the future transaction cost must be included in the appreciation).  Without boring readers with all the details, I estimate the property must appreciate 29% to break even (The NY Times estimated 19%).</p>
<p>Now 29% might not sound too unreasonable for 5 years, especially since home prices in the Bay Area have increased 19% in just the last year!  From <a href="http://www.dqnews.com/RRBay0905.shtm">Dataquick</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The median price paid for a Bay Area home was $619,000 last month, a new record. That was up &#8230; 19.0 percent from $520,000 for August a year ago.</p></blockquote>
<p> But here is the problem with this approach (and why I repeated the calculations).  Instead of a $1 Million home, I repeated the calculation with a purchase price of $2 Million.  The house would still rent for $2500 per month.  Adjusting the calculations using the higher purchase price, the house must appreciate 33% over the next 5 years for the homebuyer to break even.</p>
<p>The amount of appreciation required to break even, on a percentage basis, is only slightly higher, even though the price of the house doubled.  So looking at the percentage appreciation required is not really useful.  </p>
<p>Estimating the future value of the house is the basic difficulty with this approach.  If anyone is doing this calculation, it is important to realize that prices might not appreciate at all over the next 5 years.  In fact, home prices might decline and decline substantially.  Dr. Leamer at UCLA <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/08/dr-leamer-housing-has-peaked-recession.html">offered</a> this advice:<br />
<blockquote>If you’ve been shopping for a home, Leamer says you &#8220;need to recognize the risk and do some hard-nosed thinking&#8221; &#8230; he suggests you add up all the monthly costs and benefits (such as tax deductions) of owning versus renting. If buying still makes sense, his advice is: &#8220;Think long term — seven to 10 years. Avoid adjustable rate mortgages. Lock in a low, fixed interest rate.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;If you’re not sure you’re going to be living in the home in two to three years, don’t buy it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  NOTE: On Monday, the National Association of Realtors will release Existing Home Sales for August.  The number of transactions should still be near record levels, but it will be interesting to see if the recent trend of higher inventories continues. And on Tuesday, New Home Sales will be released and might show the first signs of a slowing market.</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong> August New Homes Sales did show signs of weakness!  (<a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/09/august-new-home-sales-1237-million.html">Here for graphs</a>).  Inventories of existing home sales continued to rise &#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Last Sunday on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton’s core political values were put on full display … But did tax cuts for the wealthy really make things worse in the Gulf Coast? Should they be repealed, as some (including Clinton and former presidential candidate John Kerry) have suggested? To answer these questions we should take a careful look at the period of time between the current president’s first tax cut (which cut taxes for the poor and middle class but deferred tax cuts for the wealthy) and the full implementation of his tax cuts for all, which occurred in May 2003 … Comparing the Clinton/Kerry tax regime to the “Bush getting everything he wanted” tax regime reveals a tremendous difference in wealth creation and (more to the point) tax revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s leave aside both the pathetic attempts by Bowyer to challenge Clinton’s core values as well as his usual confusion regarding stocks (wealth) versus flows (income and tax revenues).  Bowyer wants us to believe Bush’s fiscal policy has increased tax revenues with the not so subtle hint that Clinton’s 1993 tax rate increase lowered tax revenues.  So let’s actually take a “careful look” at real tax revenues per capita in this graph showing inflation-adjusted revenues not including payroll contributions to Social Security indexed at unity for December 1996.  It seems real per capita revenues rose dramatically during both of Clinton’s term in office but are currently only slightly higher than they were in late 1996.</p>

                                <p>The memo from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/memo-to-congress.html">Kash</a> to Congress had five options for paying for President Bush’s proposed Katrina relief.  Serious conservatives such as <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/09/index.html#000441">Bill Polley</a> have a sixth as in his “What are our Fiscal Limits”.  For example, Bill notes that the Federal government should avoid Bush’s tendency to reward his cronies with taxpayer funds.  </p>
<p>Even as the Administration wants to use Katrina as another excuse to reward his cronies with taxpayer funds, it appears that the plan to save costs by setting up <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-policy23sep23,0,2491921,full.story?coll=la-home-nation">trailer park housing</a> for the displaced victims.  Even Newt Gingrich is unhappy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even many Republicans wonder why the government would want to build trailer parks when many evacuees are now living in communities with plenty of vacant, privately owned apartments. &#8220;The idea that &#8211; in a community where we could place people in the private housing market to reintegrate them into society &#8211; we would put them in [trailer] ghettos with no jobs, no community, no future, strikes me as extraordinarily bad public policy, and violates every conservative principle that I&#8217;m aware of,&#8221; said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican. &#8220;If they do it,&#8221; Gingrich said of administration officials, &#8220;they will look back on it six months from now as the greatest disaster of this administration.&#8221; Defenders of the president&#8217;s approach say it will help Katrina&#8217;s victims without sticking taxpayers indefinitely with higher costs for social programs. &#8220;Once you begin to expand any entitlement, it&#8217;s very hard to pull back,&#8221; said Grace-Marie Turner, a health policy analyst and president of the conservative Galen Institute.</p></blockquote>
<p>An extreme version of Option Six would be to have no Federal assistance for the area struck by Katrina.  While <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/09/serial_monogamy.html">Brad DeLong</a> has promoted Rich Lowry to the Stupidest Man Alive, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200509160848.asp">Donald Luskin</a> is making a comeback  as wants us to cheer up as the Katrina disaster was not as bad as the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco:</p>
<blockquote><p>The official death-toll in San Francisco in 1906 was 478. But a century of research puts the number far higher. Gladys Hansen, retired chief archivist of the City of San Francisco, who has spent a long lifetime studying the quake, puts the verifiable death-toll above 3,000. Despite early fears that the New Orleans death-toll could reach 10,000, it now appears, thankfully, that the actual count will be only a fraction of San Francisco’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, let me get this straight.  The actual death toll during the San Francisco earthquake was supposedly six times the official death toll, but Luskin knows for a fact that the number who will have died as a result of Katrina must be far less than what has already been reported <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/21/katrina.impact/index.html">here</a>.  His clairvoyance continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Damage from the San Francisco quake and fire is estimated at $400 million, not adjusting for inflation. That represented 1.4 percent of America’s gross domestic product at the time. To exceed that fraction of present-day GDP, damage from Katrina would have to reach $170 billion. Given the current frenzy in Washington, that much money may end up getting thrown at New Orleans over the coming years. But it well exceeds even the wildest estimates of actual damages.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Mr. Luskin realizes that real GDP is substantially higher now than it was in 1906 so 1.4% of GDP today is much higher than 1.4% of GDP in 1906 – even inflation adjusted.  A reasonable assumption is that real GDP today is 25 times what it was a century ago so by Mr. Luskin’s own estimates, inflation-adjusted damages from the 1906 earthquake would be $7 billion.  Even the most optimistic (that is, lowest) estimate of actual damages would put the figure much higher than $7 billion.  But even taking his relative perspective into account, how can he be so sure that “damages” will be less than $170 billion – even if he means only the damage to physical property.  Lost wages from the displacement of the citizens of New Orleans and general human suffering do not seem to be factored into these figures.  </p>
<p>The reference to the 1906 earthquake that hit San Francisco must have motivated this from <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007278">Stephen Moore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all want to see New Orleans rebuilt, but it does not follow that this requires more than $100 billion in federal aid. Chicago was burned to the ground in 1871; San Francisco was leveled by an earthquake in 1906; and in 1900 Galveston, Texas, was razed by a hurricane even more ferocious than Katrina. In each instance, these proud cities were rebuilt rapidly and to even greater glory &#8211; with hardly any federal money. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Mr. Moore should admit that Galveston never returned to its former glory as Houston displaced it as the center of commerce in east Texas.  Moore also seems to think like Luskin that only property was damaged:</p>
<blockquote><p>When President Bush announced last Thursday that the feds would take a lead role in the reconstruction of New Orleans, he in effect established a new $200 billion federal line of credit. To put that $200 billion in perspective, we could give every one of the 500,000 families displaced by Katrina a check for $400,000, and they could each build a beach front home virtually anywhere in America</p></blockquote>
<p>How much will it take to fund to house and feed the displaced and to clean-up the environmental damage is something Mr. Moore does not address. Also see <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001619.html">this comment</a> from Max Sawicky.</p>
<p>Moore also seems to think cutting Federal spending across the board is costless:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congressman Todd Aiken of Missouri complains that Congress was forced to vote on the $62 billion first installment of funds &#8220;even though we knew a lot of the money may go to waste.&#8221; Mr. Aiken and several dozen other House conservatives proposed an amendment to the $62 billion hurricane relief bill that would offset at least some of the emergency spending by cutting other government programs a meager 2.5 cents out of every dollar that federal agencies spend. Was the amendment defeated? No. The Republican leadership would not even allow it to come to a vote, on the grounds that there was no waste which could be easily identified and cut. Dozens of other reasonable proposals to offset Katrina&#8217;s tidal wave of deficit spending have been similarly repelled. Mike Pence of Indiana suggested a one-year delay on the multitrillion dollar new prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. For 220 years, seniors have managed without this give-away; one more year of waiting would hardly be an act of cruelty. </p></blockquote>
<p>And I’m rather shocked that a libertarian is complaining about how people spend their funds – assuming the following is even true:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s only been 10 days since reconstruction funds were voted out of Congress, but there are already stories of misspending. For example, the Louis Vuitton store reported selling two monographed luxury handbags for $800 each, both paid for by women with FEMA&#8217;s $2,000 emergency disaster relief debit cards.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Mr. Moore may be correct that this White House is squandering taxpayer funds to give profits to its favorite companies in no-bid contracts that couple with the “Gulf Coast Wage Cut” (hat tip to <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Joshua Marshall</a>.  But I thought this version of “trickle-down economics” was championed by the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal.  </p>
<p>Mr. Moore is also correct about the devastation caused by the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 as <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/the_galveston_h.html">Mark Thoma</a> notes.  Let’s hope Rita is not so cruel.  Our prayers are with the residents of the Gulf.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/us-current-account-deficit.html">a brief post</a> last week, the BEA has released the most recent figures for the US current account (CA) deficit, which suggests that the CA deficit for the year will be in the neighborhood of 6.5% of GDP.  Yesterday, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/09/external_imbala.html">Brad DeLong</a> continued his excellent ruminations on the sustainability of this amount of borrowing by the US.  The crux: <br />
<blockquote>Is the current situation &#8220;unsustainable&#8221;? For how long could the U.S. continue to run a current-account deficit of, say, 7% of GDP?</p>
<p>Assume&#8230; a constant 7% of GDP current-account deficit, and find that in 2022 the U.S. net foreign asset position crosses -100% of GDP, with a current-account deficit of 7% of GDP, a trade deficit of 3% of GDP, and net income payments to foreign owners of capital of 4% of GDP. A net foreign asset position of -100% of U.S. GDP is conceivable: Britain, after all, had a net foreign asset position of +150% of then-British GDP in 1913. The trade deficit between now and 2022 has to shrink by an average of a little less than a quarter of a percentage point per year. That&#8217;s a very gradual rate of closure of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>&#8230;There is an alternative scenario, one in which foreigners&#8217;&#8211;including foreign central banks&#8217;&#8211;desired holdings of dollar-denominated assets shortly hit the wall, and the asset price shifts that result from desired holdings&#8217; hitting the wall reduce, or do not increase, confidence in the dollar.</p>
<p>&#8230;I am very cautious about declaring that I know a fundamental external imbalance when I see it. But one thing makes me exceptionally nervous&#8211;makes all of us exceptionally nervous right now. The market&#8217;s current prices appear to give a zero weight to the hit-the-wall hard-landing scenario, and 100% weight to the U.S.-acquires-an-enormous-negative-net-foreign-asset position.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have no better insight than Brad about whether the current situation represents a fundamental imbalance.  However, while preparing something for one of my classes this week I put together the following chart.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/5pct_deficits.jpg"></p>
<p>To make this chart I&#8217;ve tried to identify all of the episodes in the past 30 years where an OECD country has run a CA deficit of greater than 5% of GDP for at least one year.  As the picture makes clear, all of these episodes have one thing in common: deficits of that magnitude have never lasted for more than a couple of years.</p>
<p>This means that one of two things must be true: either the US CA deficit will shrink substantially in the next couple of years; or the US experience will be something with no historical precedent.</p>
<p>Three last points about this.  First, I haven&#8217;t gone back further than 1975 to see if there are other historical examples of 5%+ deficits for more than a few years.  There could be some such examples in earlier periods (though none immediately come to mind), and I would be curious to know about them.  </p>
<p>Second, note that one of the important points that those in the &#8220;big deficits can easily continue as far as the eye can see&#8221; school of thought make is that the US is fundamentally different from other countries because it can borrow in its own currency.  Well, most of the countries in the chart above were doing most of their borrowing in their own currency, too.  Despite this fact, one thing or another caused the 5%+ CA deficit to be unsustainable for more than a couple of years in every single case.</p>
<p>Third, if the US experience is not completely anomalous, so that its CA deficit does drop to below 5% of GDP in the next couple of years, the process will probably (though not certainly) involve a significant amount of economic distress for the US.  In particular, US imports will have to fall substantially, and the only plausible ways to acheive that are through a substantial dollar devaluation, a recession, or both.  This is what worries me: I don&#8217;t claim to be able to predict the mechanics of how or why the US deficit will fall&#8230; but if the US <em>does</em> adhere to all historical experience, then the CA deficit <em>will</em> fall, and bad stuff will have happened to make it fall.</p>
<p>One thing seems clear to me from this. If you&#8217;re not worried about the US&#8217;s CA sustainability, then you are necessarily positing that the US experience will be dramatically different from that of other countries &#8211; even other rich countries that, like the US, could borrow in their own currency.</p>

                                <p>One normally thinks of American exports of beef to Japan.  Japan has decided to cease purchases of American beef with a mad cow scare being their excuse for trade protection.  It turns out I had enjoyed a meal this weekend with Kobe beef not even thinking about where it came from.  And now we <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/21/congress.agriculture.ap/index.html">learn</a> that the politicians wish to limit imports of Kobe beef from Japan:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Kobe beef should stay off U.S. menus if Japan won&#8217;t buy American beef, the Senate has decided. Senators retaliated Tuesday against Japan for refusing to lift a mad cow-related ban on U.S. beef. On a 72-26 vote, the Senate adopted an amendment prohibiting importation of Japanese beef until Japan lifts its ban. Japan&#8217;s stalling is unfair, said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, who offered the amendment.&#8221; There have been two cases of mad cow disease in the United States, one from Canada,&#8221; Nelson said in a Senate speech. &#8220;Statistically, it&#8217;s nonexistent, in terms of the millions of head of cattle that are sent to slaughter every year.&#8221; Lawmakers adopted a similar, nonbinding measure by Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colorado, on a voice vote. Once the biggest customer of American beef, importing more than $1.5 billion worth in 2003, Japan has refused to allow the purchase of U.S. beef since the nation&#8217;s first case of mad cow disease was confirmed in Washington state almost two years ago. Japan agreed last fall to lift the ban but still hasn&#8217;t done so.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Senator Nelson may be correct about the Japanese trade restriction, his remedy is a poor idea in my view.</p>

<blockquote><p>Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist sold his stock in HCA Inc., the Nashville-based hospital chain his family founded, shortly before the stock took almost a 9% dive in mid-July. The sale helps minimize allegations that he has a conflict of interest on health-care issues as he considers a run for president. Frist&#8217;s brother, Thomas, is a former chief executive officer and current director of the company.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Senator Frist has noted on health-care issues before July 2005.  Some of the <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_09_18.php#006602">left</a> are asking if Frist had insider information.  The news article quotes a Frist spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frist spokeswoman Amy Call said the senator had no knowledge of when the stock actually sold. He requested the sale June 13, but the execution of the sale was up to the blind trust that manages his holdings. &#8220;Frist had no control over when the stocks were sold. The trustee could have chosen to hold them or sell at any time. Also, we don&#8217;t know when the stock was sold, only when we were notified.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Blind trusts exist to avoid political conflicts of interest, which is a different issue from insider trading.  Joshua Marshall – who understands this distinction &#8211; promises “more soon”.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/21/AR2005092102065.html">Richard Drezen</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>According to Senate ethics rules, Baran said, Frist &#8220;can tell somebody to dispose of all of an asset that was initially placed into the blind trust. As a matter of Senate ethics rules, he is in compliance. The question that remains is, why did he sell the stock at that time? What conflicts arose in June that did not exist beforehand?&#8221; &#8220;For the Securities and Exchange Commission,&#8221; Baran added, &#8220;the answer is probably very important.&#8221; According to Thomson Financial, a reporting service, seven senior HCA executives sold 574,882 shares worth $19,942,610 between May 17 and June 10. A company spokesman, Jeff Prescott, said the executives are entitled &#8220;like other stockholders [to] make personal decisions . . . about when to sell.&#8221; He said the executives complied with &#8220;blackout restrictions&#8221; imposed by the SEC to prevent dealing within a certain period prior to restatements of earnings. An SEC spokesman said it is the commission&#8217;s policy not to comment on investigations, and would neither confirm nor deny that it is probing insider trading at HCA.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001622.html">Max Sawicky</a> reads the latest from the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm849.cfm?renderforprint=1">Heritage Foundation</a> and is very kind:<br />
<blockquote>Tax increases (actually, preventing scheduled phase-out of tax cuts, but no matter) are contractionary. People have less money to spend, less employment results. Government spending cuts are expansionary. People have less money to spend, and more employment results. I have to say that at my age, contractioning can be hard to avoid.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that the folks at the Heritage Foundation are arguing that tax cuts create more aggregate demand, so Max – who does understand what Keynes wrote – is simply pointing out that reducing government spending would tend to lower aggregate demand.  But the source of the confusion from the Heritage Foundation is even deeper than their failure to read the <em>General Theory</em>:<br />
<blockquote>Nationally, however, the fundamental reduction of aggregate supply, mixed with government-back increase in aggregate demand means that generally higher inflation over the next year is a sure thing … The enduring lesson of the Great Depression is that economic policy should not be contractionary in the face of a contraction. That fundamental rule is adhered to by neoclassical economists and is also one of the sacred commandments of Keynesians—a rare point of agreement between the two groups…Making the Bush tax cuts permanent would create 430,000 additional jobs nationally in 2006 alone and an average of 624,000 per year over the next decade, according to our macroeconomic modeling … Congress now has a very tough political decision: whether to make the 2003 tax cuts permanent, to let them to phase out as scheduled, or to repeal them promptly in order to help “pay for” Katrina. There is an alternative to taxing more, and that is spending less. It may be tough politically, but re-prioritizing spending and limiting its future growth is the only way to change fiscal policy without harming the economy. Spending discipline is the path to making tax cuts permanent and creating more jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the one hand, they seem to be arguing that aggregate demand may fall below full employment, while on the other hand, they seem to agree with the David Altig view that we are near full employment.  Now Max does not agree with Dr. Altig – and neither do I.  But most Keynesian economists tend to agree with the classical view that economies do gravitate towards full employment.  As such, reductions in the national savings rate from permanent tax cuts would lead to less investment – not more.</p>

                                <p>It would seem that certain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/national/nationalspecial/21cong.html">House conservatives</a> read the memo from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/memo-to-congress.html">Kash</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 &#8211; Conservative House Republicans plan to recommend on Wednesday more than $500 billion in savings over 10 years to compensate for the costs of Hurricane Katrina as lawmakers continue to struggle to develop a consensus on the fiscal approach to the disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_09/007175.php">Kevin Drum</a> reads the fine print:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, they&#8217;ve identified $100 billion so far. Only $400 billion to go! Aside from the fact that I&#8217;m delighted to see Republicans screaming at each other over this, the whole spectacle is kind of sad. Could we save $500 billion over ten years? Of course we could. That&#8217;s $50 billion a year, about 2% of the entire federal budget. On the other hand, it also shows how ridiculous this whole exercise is. $50 billion in cuts would reduce federal spending from 19.8% of GDP to 19.4% of GDP. Yippee.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if all of these conservative proposals pass, we would still be very far from a path that would put us on a path where Federal debt would start falling as a percent of GDP.  Kevin has a few more suggestions to add to the list including “raise taxes”.  </p>
<p>But let’s not kid ourselves – even if we raised taxes along the lines suggested by John Kerry last year, we would still have a growing debt to GDP ratio.  Didn’t Howard Dean say something about repealing all of Bush’s tax cuts and reducing government spending?</p>
