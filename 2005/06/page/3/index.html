                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_nugent/nugent200506230902.asp">Thomas Nugent</a> provides a very extended “question” that Republican Congressman Ron Paul asked Alan Greenspan and then notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe these politicians simply improvise around the questions their interns write for them. But more than likely they have no clue what they’re talking about. Of course, there’s ample entertainment value to all this. Just look at the faces of the legislators after Greenspan has answered their questions: Their expressions of puzzlement are priceless. Then there are the politicians who use 80 percent of their allotted time to campaign for office, not asking one meaningful question of the chairman.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I agree with Nugent that politicians often have no clue about economics, let me tick off a summary of the various questions Congressman Paul asked – all of which seem to be important to me – even if I happen to disagree with some of the implied “economic principles” where the Congressman does seem clueless:</p>
<p>Q1: Do high interest rates come more from higher government spending as opposed to higher deficits (as in from tax cuts)?</p>
<p>Q2: Does our propensity to lend to foreign entities provide a benefit to us in the form of interest free loans and exporting inflation?</p>
<p>Q3: “when do you anticipate the next currency crisis in the Mexican peso?” – in reference to the premise that Mexico has not reduced its solvency problems even years after the loan we provided to them.</p>
<p>Q4: Why should we worry about higher wages and not worry about higher returns to owners of capital?</p>
<p>Since Nugent forgot to tell us which of these four implied questions he finds amusing, let me suggest I disagree with the premises in Q1 and Q2, but I have seen some of Nugent’s NRO colleagues utter the same misguided notions.  On Q3 and Q4, I think the Congressman has a point.  Rather than mocking the Congressman, maybe Nugent should provide his readers a “civic lesson” on his view of the economic issues relevant to these two questions.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/06/bubble_schmubbl.html">Alex Tabarrok</a> adds to the debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real question is not whether there is a bubble the question is, What are the chances that housing prices will fall dramatically?  Contrary to popular belief, knowledge of whether prices are following fundamentals or a bubble tells us very little about this question.  An efficient market is not necessarily a stable market.  Indeed, an efficient market can be as or even more volatile than a market plagued by bubbles … Since r and g are small a small change in g can have a large effect on the P/E ratio &#8211; so much in fact that it is very difficult to reject a model of stock prices based solely on fundamentals</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s return to this after we follow-up on a small detail related to the update to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/housing-stocks-v-residential.html">yesterday’s post</a>.  AB reader Rich Berger rightfully insists on an apples-to-apples comparison as far as time periods and notes a 67% increase in the number of houses from the end of 1972 to the end of 2004.  The Census also reports that total population increased by 41% over this same time period whereas Kudlow claimed a 75% increase in the number of households over some vague statement of what the time period was supposed to be.  So while the number of housing units relative to the number of households may have roughly stayed the same – assuming Kudlow’s reporting is correct, it would appear that there are fewer people per household.  Unless houses today are smaller than they were 30 years ago, there is more housing space per person.  </p>
<p>Alex Tabarrok’s discussion related to Kudlow’s discussion in the following way.  AB reader Movie Guy notes that the increase in the relative price of housing has occurred only recently.  Alex is noting that the recent fall in interest rates would tend to push up the relative price of housing quite rapidly.  Conversely, a rise in interest rates would tend to lower the price of housing quite rapidly, which would have a dramatic impact on the demand for residential construction &#8211; even if the &#8220;bubbleheads&#8221; are wrong about housing being currently overvalued.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">CalculatedRisk</a> previewed the latest UCLA Anderson Forecast and Dr. Leamer is concerned that residential investment demand will decline – especially in California.  <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200506201040.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> suggests that Leamer and CalculatedRisk are “bubbleheads”.  Kudlow gives a couple of interesting reasons for questioning forecasts of weak residential investment, but he also provides the following strange logic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although year-to-date housing starts have kicked up to 2 million, average new construction since the early 1970s has hovered around 1.5 million to 1.75 million new starts per year. During the same period, the number of American households has increased by 48 million, or 75 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is plain to see that the family demand for homes has far outstripped the supply of newly built residences.  So it should not be shocking that home prices have tended to rise on a steady basis, averaging 6.5 percent price gains over the last 35 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll take Kudlow’s word for his assertion that the nominal price of houses is now nine times what we observed 35 years ago but since the general price-level in 2004 was 4.14 times what it was in 1969, this nominal appreciation amounts to a relative price increase over the past 35 years than less than 120%.  CalculatedRisk has provided lots of informative graphs and discussions on the real estate market with <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/03/california-real-estate-prices-boom-and.html">this one</a> of particular interest.  The relative price of housing in California at least has risen substantially over the past few years but all that can be said about the 1976 to 1998 era was that real housing prices were volatile.  Kudlow, however, seems to be confused over the difference between flows of residential investment versus stocks of houses.  The following graph shows residential investment as a share of GDP and does indicate that the current investment to GDP ratio is not extraordinarily high even if it is above what we had seen in recent years.  The graph also shows residential investment demand is volatile.  But Kudlow’s observation that they are 75% more households today as compared to 35 years ago does not mean that the house to population ratio has necessarily declined for a simple reason – housing once built tend to last a long time.  President Bush was telling some Maryland audience today why we needed to have more pork barrel spending for the energy companies paid for by more tax cuts (ah let our kids pick up those massive deferred tax liabilities) and gave his usual sunny stump speech, which included reminds me of Kash’s post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/bush-takes-credit-for-home-ownership.html">Bush Takes Credit for Home Ownership</a>.  If demand is outstripping supply as Kudlow suggests, then why has the ratio of houses owned to population increased?  I have not done the math necessarily to convert the average residential investment demand to GDP ratio into an annual percentage increase in the housing stock, but let’s suppose the housing stock has grown by about 2% per year for 35 years.  If there are 75% more households but twice the number of houses, then Kudlow’s numbers are not contrary to what Bush said after all.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ri.JPG"></p>
<p>Kudlow also notes that <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/cm.txt">mortgage rates</a> are still modest.  Bush’s insistence on continued long-term fiscal stimulus is certainly not the reason.  I would argue that the continued weakness in labor markets is part of the explanation even as Bush claims employment rose by 3.5 million during his first term (I guess no one ever told him about the BLS footnote in the tables reporting the Household Survey figures).  Kudlow seems to think that appropriately tight monetary policy is the reason why mortgage rates remain modest even though he had earlier <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505110857.asp">criticized</a> tight money even as he claimed the labor market was strong.  </p>
<p>Kudlow also notes that the homebuilder stocks such as <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TOL&#038;t=5y">Toll Brothers</a> have enjoyed significant price increases over the past few years as sales and profits have increased.  Since stock valuations reflect expect expected future cash flows, these high valuations do seem at odds with the forecasts from Dr. Leamer.  Perhaps, the premise that California’s real estate bubble is only regional and not national suggests to Wall Street investors that while those in LA might be wise to <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/macroeconomic_policy_/2005/05/speculative_selling_in_the_la_housing_market.php">sell their house</a>, the fortunes of companies that have economic activities across the nation may differ.  While these stock valuations <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ts/050620/10228808.html?.v=3">declined</a> on Monday, their valuations remain quite high.  However, Richard Suttmeier’s Homebuilders&#8217; Charts Testing Hearts (RealMoney) suggests that they are overvalued.  I have just one question for Mr. Kudlow: are you purchasing or selling shares of companies in this sector?</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Thanks to CalculatedRisk for pointing out that the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/historic/histtab7.html">Census Bureau</a> provides historical data on the total housing inventory.  All units in 1969 were 69.778 million and were 122.187 million in 2004, which represents a 75% increase.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning the US Secretary of Energy, Sam Bodman, offered his analysis of today&#8217;s high oil prices.  Short version: don&#8217;t expect anything to change soon.<br />
<blockquote> WASHINGTON (<a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&#038;storyID=2005-06-22T140240Z_01_N22679983_RTRIDST_0_POLITICS-ENERGY-OIL-BODMAN-DC.XML">Reuters</a>) &#8211; U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said Wednesday it will take years to close the gap between increasing world oil consumption and the ability of oil producers to meet that demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to be measuring this in years, not in months,&#8221; he said in a speech to the National Petroleum Council.</p>
<p>Bodman pointed out that before 2004, world oil demand grew annually at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day. But last year, it rose by about 2.7 million bpd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worldwide, the supply of oil is having considerable difficulty keeping pace with growing demand,&#8221; the energy secretary said, adding that a large part of the increase in oil demand is due to strong economic growth in countries like China and India.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that I disagree with him, except in one crucial respect: his comments seem to imply that he thinks oil prices will fall in coming years as supply catches up with demand, while I think it much more likely that in five years oil prices will be higher than they are today.</p>

                                <p>Brooke Oberwetter’s <a href="http://www.reason.com/hod/bo061305.shtml">critique</a> of Wexler’s Social Security proposal wants us to believe that we can somehow avoid tax increases.  But then there is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has proposed the largest marginal tax increase this country has seen in decades: a 6 percent tax hike on all income over the current $90,000 payroll tax cap. Let us pass over the discussion of how ever-rising marginal tax rates lead to tighter labor markets, reductions in productivity, and declines in reported income. Let us forget in their entirety the issues of tax revenue and solvency and instead try to figure out why, exactly, Democratic lawmakers are so hell-bent on preserving the basic current structure of Social Security. </p></blockquote>
<p>I can see why Oberwetter wants “us pass over the discussion” of general fund <em>solvency</em>, but did Oberwetter mean to suggest an employment tax increase would reduce the current slack in the labor market?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The price of oil is at <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?column=Futures+Movers&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">around $60 per barrel</a> for the second day in a row today.  Note that this is this highest price for crude oil in real terms since the end of 1982.</p>
<p>Naturally, this means that the value of US oil imports will continue to grow from their already high levels.  As the chart below illustrates, the US now spends close to $20 bn per month on imported oil, roughly double the average of just two years ago.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_import0.jpg"></p>
<p>But it is worth noting that US oil imports are growing not just relative to what they were a couple of years ago, but also relative to the US economy in general. The following chart shows the real price of oil, and US oil imports as a % of GDP, from 1978 up through the first quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_import1.jpg"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the portion of US GDP devoted to buying imported oil closely tracks the price of oil.  But the chart also shows that for a given price of oil, the US economy is more dependent on imported oil than at almost any time in history.  In early 2005 a larger share of US income was spent on imported oil than at any time other than the brief period 1979-1982.  And of course, since then, the price of oil has risen by several more dollars per barrel.</p>
<p>This has several implications.  One is simply that the US economy is more susceptible to developments in foreign oil-producing countries than ever before.  Another is that some economists (myself included) may need to recalibrate our mental maps of the world slightly; oil imports matter a LOT to the US economy today. This was not true during the 1990s, when energy imports were a relatively insignificant detail in the overall picture of the US economy.  But today US oil imports make up a giant component of international trade and financial flows (a point <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/06/oil_nuff_said_a.html">Brad Setser</a> has effectively made recently), and are crucial to understanding the US macroeconomy more generally.</p>

                                <p>Southern California is known for its freeways, which are often jammed with traffic.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/19/AR2005061900698.html">Amy Argetsinger and Steven Ginsberg</a> report on our experiment with private toll roads.  As I resident of LA who rarely even uses the public freeways, I did not even know these toll roads were privately owned.  I also certainly did not know that one could pay $7.75 in tolls to drive home.  </p>
<p>On occasion, the opportunity cost of my one-way commute during rush hour on the I-5 was likely much higher.  Did I just made a case that we freeway drivers should be subsidizing the private toll roads?!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Let me apologize for my hiatus last week; it was the result of a nasty virus that took me pretty much the entire week to recover from.  At any rate, I find that my mood is not being improved by reading about the economic situation in Europe.  And apparently I&#8217;m not alone in my disappointment.  Yesterday the Swedish central bank acknowledged the increasingly gloomy economic prospects in Europe for this year when it somewhat dramatically <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/6421b240-e238-11d9-84c5-00000e2511c8.html">cut interest rates</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Sweden’s central bank cut interest rates by a surprisingly large 50 basis points to a new historic low of 1.50 percent on Tuesday and some analysts said the door was open to further easing. </p>
<p>The decision sent ripples through Swedish markets and beyond, into the euro zone government bond market, where traders said the Riksbank had turned the spotlight on Europe’s economic woes and added to pressure on the European Central Bank to cut rates.  Like the ECB, the Swedish central has been under pressure to cut rates to boost sluggish job market with inflation running low.</p></blockquote>
<p>That pressure on the ECB to cut euro-area interest rates does indeed seem to be growing with each passing week.  In response, the dollar has gained surprising strength against the euro in recent weeks, with some observers considering that an exchange rate of $1.10 to one euro is not out of the question <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7fa022ee-e23e-11d9-84c5-00000e2511c8.html">in the near future</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The euro continued to fall in European morning trade on Tuesday amid mounting speculation that the European Central Bank may be preparing the market for an interest rate cut.</p>
<p>A newswire report on Monday, quoting unnamed ECB sources, claimed that the Frankfurt-based bank was starting to consider the prospect of a rate cut, having held rates at 2 per cent for the past two years&#8230;  [A]s Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, pointed out: “Whatever the ultimate monetary disposition of the ECB, interest rate differentials between the United States and the eurozone are likely to widen further as the Federal Open Market Committee continues to move towards a neutral monetary stance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve generally thought that the dollar-euro exchange rate is largely irrelevant to determining the US current account deficit (which is determined principally by national savings balances in my opinion), so I don&#8217;t think this changes the US&#8217;s trade picture much.  But at the very least, if this recent rise in the dollar continues, this certainly does raise the possibility that dollar bears (like Warren Buffett) could be in for some nasty balance sheet surprises in the next few months&#8230;</p>

                                <p>It seems that <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.com/">Andrew Roth</a> of the Club for Growth has an odd flair for the English language as he suggests that Bill Thomas is about to introduce a “MONSTER BILL”.  Part of this bill seems to be the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/demints-recycled-free-lunch.html">DeMint proposal</a> to strip away the Social Security surplus, which will make the unified deficit as large as the general fund deficit.  So how does Thomas plan to address this larger unified deficit?  More tax cuts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another key component of the mega-bill Thomas has in mind would be the tax break at the top of the wish list of many investors: erasing the 2008 expiration date on the 15 percent top income tax rate on capital gains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the GOP does seem to have some strange desire to give us more monsters to insure our children will have a massive future tax bill to pay.</p>

                                <p>The latest Harris Poll is out, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111894638239161666,00.html">courtesy of the WSJ</a> (subscription):</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/Cabinet.gif"></p>
<p>The poll also reports that in answer to the question, &#8220;How would you rate the job President George W. Bush is doing as president – excellent, pretty good, only fair, or poor?&#8221;, 45% responded with either &#8220;excellent&#8221; or &#8220;pretty good&#8221; while 55% answered negatively &#8212; either &#8220;only fair&#8221; or &#8220;poor&#8221;. But that does at least put the president well ahead of the vice president.</p>
<p>When asked a follow-up question about Dick Cheney, &#8220;And how would you rate the job Vice President Cheney is doing &#8211; excellent, pretty good, only fair or poor?&#8221;, only 38% gave a positive response and 56% replied &#8220;only fair&#8221; or &#8220;poor&#8221;.</p>
