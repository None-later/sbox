                                <p>The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">May employment report</a> released this morning by the BLS is quite disappointing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm employment edged up by 78,000 in May following a much larger increase in April, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 5.1 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Payroll employment continued to grow over the month in health care and construction, but was little changed in the other major industry sectors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it still seems that the strong jobs reports that crop up sporadically (like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/april-employment-report.html">last month&#8217;s report</a>) remain more the exception than the rule.</p>

                                <p>The US economy has achieved incredibly rapid productivity improvements over the past few years.  Yet until recently, firms have been able to keep those gains to themselves rather than increasing the compensation they offer their workers.  Over the past year or so, that appears to have started to change.  From today&#8217;s BLS release on <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm">productivity and compensation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Productivity rose 2.9 percent in the nonfarm business sector during the first quarter of 2005, reflecting a 4.0-percent rise in output and a 1.1 percent increase in hours of all persons (table 2).  In fourth-quarter 2004, nonfarm productivity grew 2.3 percent as output grew 3.7 percent and hours increased 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>Hourly compensation increased 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2005. After revision, this measure grew at a 10.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2004&#8211;faster than in any quarter since the first quarter of 2000, when hourly compensation increased 14.5 percent.  When the rise in consumer prices is taken into account, real hourly compensation rose 3.9 in the first quarter of 2005.  Real hourly compensation had increased 6.4 percent in the previous quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a welcome change.  The economic downturn of 2001-03 caused a significant wedge to grow between what workers were producing and what they were receiving in compensation, as the following chart shows.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/prod_comp1.jpg"><br />Source: BLS.</p>
<p>The divergence between productivity and compensation in the period 2001-03 was almost certainly due to the weak US labor market during that period.  As the labor market in the US has strengthened (note that I&#8217;m not saying that the labor market is strong right now, just that it has strengthened relative to where it was during 2001-03) workers have begun to be able to extract higher compensation from their employers.</p>
<p>Two last notes.  First, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that &#8220;globalization&#8221; or &#8220;international competition&#8221; are not likely explanations for the weak compensation growth of the period 2001-03.  The following chart shows one simple measure of international competition on the US: the ratio of imports to total GDP.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/imp_gdp1.jpg"><br />Source: BEA, NIPA.</p>
<p>If greater international competition causes lower labor compensation, then we would have expected to see compensation do poorly during 1998-2000 and 2004-05, when imports were growing rapidly, and for compensation to do well during 2001-03, when imports went down.  In fact, we see just the opposite.</p>
<p>Finally, one should also keep in mind that higher compensation does not necessarily translate into higher take-home pay for most workers.  Much of whatever increases in compensation that workers have received in recent years have been simply in the form of higher health insurance benefits, as the last chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/wages_benefits1.jpg"><br />Source: BEA, NIPA.  Series deflated by the PCE deflator.</p>
<p>Whether or not individuals are actually benefiting in any real sense from their increased compensation is a whole different topic.  Given that much of those compensation gains simply go toward covering large increases in health insurance premiums that yield little or no actual improvements in health care for the average person, I&#8217;d say the answer is no.  For more on this, check out some of our posts under &#8220;The U.S. Health Care System&#8221; on the left of this page.</p>
<p>But at least compensation is starting to rise.  This is a good indicator of some slowly gaining strength in the labor market, and with luck it will continue a bit more before the next economic slowdown&#8230;</p>

                                <p>David Brook’s latest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/opinion/02brooks.html?oref=login">attack</a> on America’s liberals points to European policies and claims that folks with relatively high income are worse off than folks whose income may be low but rising:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anybody who has lived in Europe knows how delicious European life can be. But it is not the absolute standard of living that determines a people&#8217;s morale, but the momentum. It is happier to live in a poor country that is moving forward &#8211; where expectations are high &#8211; than it is to live in an affluent country that is looking back.</p></blockquote>
<p>With U.S. GDP growing at 3.5% per year and China growing at a rate near 9% per year, David’ argument is that we should ignore the fact that China’s real per capita GDP is $5600 versus U.S. real per capita GDP near $40,000.  But then David turns to a comparison of output per person:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Western European standard of living is about a third lower than the American standard of living, and it&#8217;s sliding. European output per capita is less than that of 46 of the 50 American states and about on par with Arkansas.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/">Matthew Yglesias</a> points out a few reasons why David’s argument is “a pretty silly way to think about the problem”.  Those of us schooled in Solow growth model thinking might ask questions such as the level of capital per worker at the end of World War II and how much has each nation invested in new capital each year since.  The U.S. had enjoyed a period of strong savings and investment from 1946 to 1980 – but then the fiscal irresponsibility during the Reagan and Bush43 Administrations have undermined this commitment.  Yet, David does not mention savings and investment at all in his op-ed.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While AB added a trackback to perhaps the best comment on the Brooks op-ed, I’d also like to thank <a href="http://plumer.blogspot.com/2005_06_01_plumer_archive.html#111774072653904277">Brad Plumer</a> for pointing out this statement from Robert Pozen:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gross domestic product has grown at an average rate of 3.3 percent a year in the United States over the last decade, compared to 2.1 percent a year in the EU15. Per capita GDP growth, however, has been very similar: 1.8 percent a year in the United States, 1.7 percent in the EU15. The main factor driving higher U.S. economic growth is not greater productivity gains; it is a more rapidly expanding population.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Rather than go on and on about the nonsense that emanates from the free lunch proponents of Social Security privatization &#8211; or those free lunch supply-side wingnuts who argue “giving people their money back” so they consume more somehow increases economic growth &#8211; let me simply outsource this task to <a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2005/05/29-week/index.html#a000076">Daniel Gross</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How dumb are the free-lunchers? In today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal, Jackie Calmes has a piece about the two South Carolina Senators’ different attitudes toward Social Security reform. Lindsey Graham, the state&#8217;s senior senator, is a representative of the “pain caucus.” He advocates cutting benefits and raising payroll taxes to ensure solvency. (In other words, he advocates solving the problem honestly.) Sen. Jim DeMint, a freshman Senator, is held out as a representative of the &#8220;free lunch caucus.&#8221; His solution? Don’t cut benefits. Instead, as the Journal&#8217;s handy thumbnail sketch puts it: “use remaining Social security annual surplus, to 2017, for private accounts. Cut other government spending to offset the diverted payroll-tax revenue.” Add water, and wait ten years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel follows by challenging the GOP to follow through with the necessary spending cuts.  Maybe I should buy Daniel lunch tomorrow for writing such a very good post!</p>

<blockquote><p>General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the two biggest U.S. automakers, saw sales slip again in May as customers continued to turn away from sport utility vehicles and trucks in favor of models from Japanese competitors.</p></blockquote>
<p>And given the fact that the Bush Administration is for free trade except when trade protection is politically expedient – will “voluntary” export restrictions be the headline story in the next few weeks?</p>

                                <p>Today the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) released its latest estimates of house prices in the US, covering the first quarter of 2005.  Unsurprisingly, house prices <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/1q05hpi.pdf">continue to go up</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – Average U.S. home prices increased 12.50 percent from the first quarter of 2004 through the first quarter of 2005. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.21 percent, or an annualized rate of 8.82 percent. The new data represent the largest four quarter increase since the third quarter of 2004, when appreciation surpassed any increase in over 25 years. The figures were released today by OFHEO Acting Director Stephen A. Blumenthal, as part of the House Price Index (HPI), a quarterly report analyzing housing price appreciation trends.</p>
<p>“The House Price Index shows the rise in house prices continues at an extremely strong pace and raises the potential for declines in some areas later on,” said OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at the national average of house prices makes little sense, however; I think that a much better gauge of the behavior of house prices can be found with regional housing markets.  The following graph shows inflation-adjusted house prices in several metropolitan areas over the past 30 years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/houseprices2.jpg"><br />Note: house prices are deflated by the &#8220;CPI less shelter&#8221; price index.</p>
<p>In many major markets, houses are now roughly twice as expensive as they were in 1995, in inflation-adjusted terms.  And the rate of increase in recent years is&#8230; quite high.  </p>

                                <p>How Machiavellian was the Nixon White House?  The reaction of some of Nixon’s aids to the news that Mark Felt was Deep Throat speaks volumes.  Consider this comment from <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/01/ltm.02.html">Gordon Liddy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I view him as someone who violated the ethics of the law-enforcement profession, in that if he possessed evidence of wrongdoing, he was honor bound to take that to a grand jury and secure an indictment, not to selectively leak it to a single news source.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s remember Liddy’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/liddy.html">role</a> as we also remember that President Nixon along with Haldeman and Ehrlichman were actively engaged in a cover-up that included the firing of Archibald Cox as prosecutor on October 20, 1973.  I’m sure Liddy et al. would have loved it had Mr. Felt limited his actions to the normal channels of the Justice Department.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8060320">Today Show</a> interviewed Charles Colson and Patrick Buchanan.  Buchanan argued that Felt cooperated with the Washington Post because he did not get a promotion and that the Post reporters were nothing but stenographers (as if journalism should be just making stuff up rather than telling one’s readers what your sources really said).  Buchanan also played the criticize the government = defaming the troops card:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, it brings you back to those days, and look, I think the breaking of Richard Nixon and the destruction of his presidency by people who had hated him for a long time &#8211; Nixon gave them the sword &#8211; that resulted in really pouring down a sewer really everything which 58,000 gave their lives in Vietnam. People forget that six months after Watergate, Nixon was at 69 percent, he had won 49 states, the POWs were coming home, every provincial capital was in South Vietnamese hands. Two years later, after he was destroyed, you had a holocaust of a million people dead in Cambodia. So I think that Mark Felt was ashamed at what he did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the argument contradicts itself as Nixon ended our military involvement in Indochina before the Watergate crisis heated up.  But the most disturbing comments came from Colson:</p>
<blockquote><p>My experience with Mark Felt was that he was thoroughly professional each time I dealt with him. I trusted him completely. I was with the President one night and both the President and I talked to him on the phone, and I sensed that the President had a lot of trust in him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Colson went on to suggest that letting the public know the truth about the activities of this incredibly corrupt White House was itself corrupt and a violation of trust.  </p>
<p>I agree with those who say Mark Felt was a hero who helped purge such Machiavellian behavior from the White House, but the benefits lasted for just over a quarter of a century.  The current White House eclipses the Nixon White House in almost every dimension from abusing a war for partisan purposes to destroying anyone who dares to criticize its actions.  So is there a modern day version of Mark Felt?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006763">Peggy Noonan</a> says Mark Felt did a bad, bad thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Mr. Felt helped produce was a weakened president who was a serious president at a serious time. Nixon&#8217;s ruin led to a cascade of catastrophic events &#8211; the crude and humiliating abandonment of Vietnam and the Vietnamese, the rise of a monster named Pol Pot, and millions -millions &#8211; killed in his genocide. America lost confidence; the Soviet Union gained brazenness. What a terrible time. Is it terrible when an American president lies and surrounds himself by dirty tricksters? Yes, it is. How about the butchering of children in the South China Sea. Is that worse? Yes. Infinitely, unforgettably and forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peggy must be confused as to the chain of events that brought about the demise of <a href="http://www.khmerkampongspeu.org/lonnol.htm">Prince Sihanouk</a>.</p>

                                <p>As I start getting reaquainted with the financial press following my 10-day &#8216;vacation&#8217;, the first thing that has caught my attention is the continued fall in long-term interest rates.  The ‘conundrum’ about which Alan Greenspan spoke a few months ago has not resolved itself, after <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/interest-rate-mystery.html">briefly appearing</a> as though it might back in March.  Instead, the mystery has deepened, in the sense that long-term interest rates have fallen noticeably over the past month or two even though the Fed continues to increase short-term interest rates.  (See <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/three-discussions-of-low-long-rate.html">Mark Thoma</a> for a few more recent viewpoints about this puzzle, mystery, conundrum, or whatever you want to call it.)</p>
<p>The following chart shows the essence of the interest rate mystery: short-term rates keep rising, while long-term rates don’t.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum1.jpg"></p>
<p>Of particular surprise to many observers, in recent weeks the bond market has completely reversed the rise in yields that we saw a couple of months ago. This resounding defeat of the bond market bears has been so striking as to convince some of them, like <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050531-tue.html">Stephen Roach</a>, to give up being a bear altogether.</p>
<p>I don’t have any new theories to offer to explain the mystery.  Just to recap, the prevailing theories to explain low long-term interest rates in the US are 1) the bond market expects the US economy to weaken, and thus expects inflation rates and private-sector borrowing needs to diminish; 2) corporate America is simply saving their profits, rather than spending them, thus limiting corporate borrowing needs and adding to current the supply of available savings; 3) there is a global glut of savings, which has driven interest rates down worldwide, including in the US; and 4) foreign central banks have been pushing such vast quantities of funds into the US treasury market that their actions have had a substantial impact on the US treasury market.</p>
<p>Obviously, these theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and the true explanation almost certainly involves some combination of some or all of these factors.  The real question is therefore whether we can gauge the relative importance of these different effects.</p>
<p>Some more data may help to provide some insight into what’s going on in the long-term bond market.  Plus, this is a good excuse for me to flex my slightly out-of-shape graphing muscles.  </p>
<p>First, let’s break the long-term yield into its two components: the portion of the yield that compensates investors for expected inflation over the life of the bond, and the portion of the yield that comprises the real (after inflation) underlying rate of return.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum2.jpg"><br />Note: the real yield is the 10-yr TIPS (inflation-indexed) interest rate, while inflation expectations are the difference between the TIPS rate and the nominal interest rate.</p>
<p>Interestingly, over the past couple of weeks the fall in yields has been almost entirely due to a fall in inflation expectations.  Meanwhile, the real (inflation-adjusted) yield has remained at historically low levels after a brief spike in March 2005. The recent decline in inflation expectations lends some support to hypothesis (1), that there is a growing belief that the US economy (or perhaps the world economy) may be weakening.</p>
<p>What about the idea that low US interest rates simply reflect low worldwide interest rates? The next chart compares long-term interest rates in the US with those of the euro zone:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/conundrum3.jpg"></p>
<p>Over the past six months an unusual gap has opened up between German government bond yields and US government bond yields.  This lends some credence to hypothesis (3), which suggests that today’s low long-term interest rates are a world-wide phenomenon rather than being particular to the US, and reflect a global abundance of savings and/or a dearth in global borrowing by corporations to undertake investment projects.  The gap also suggests that the bears were right and long-term interest rates in the US actually have risen &#8211; when compared to interest rates in the rest of the world.  <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/05/bretton_woods_t_1.html">Brad Setser</a> makes this point in a recent post.</p>
<p>My own particular take on this data is that I&#8217;m becoming more convinced that there is a growing sense in financial markets (at least the bond market) that economic growth is slowing, perhaps both in the US and in the rest of the world.  I’ve been a firm believer in the impact of Asian central bank reserve accumulation on US interest rates, as well, and I&#8217;m sure that CB purchases of US government bonds have exacerbated the interest rate mystery.  But I am becoming more and more convinced that there are other forces at work here than just that one.</p>

<blockquote>I also believe that columnists are entitled by their mandate to engage in the unfair use of statistics, the misleading representation of opposing positions, and the conscious withholding of contrary data. But because they’re entitled doesn’t mean I or you have to like it, or think it’s good for the newspaper. </p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Columnists are &#8220;entitled by their mandate&#8221; to mislead and deceive in the New York Times? Clearly, it&#8217;s not the role of the just departed public editor to, well, act in the interests of the body public and guard it from deception bearing the Times&#8217; imprimatur.(*) But shouldn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.nytco.com/company-executives-gcollins.html">the actual OP/Ed editor</a> care about such things?</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) I&#8217;m not claiming that some editorial columnists don&#8217;t lie and deceive all the time in the Op/Ed pages. But until now I had figured that the editors were for the most part too lazy, and occasionally too stupid, to see what was slipping past them. Apparently, noble geniuses that they are, opinion editors (and public editors) are fully aware of the deceptions by those that they employ, but &#8212; alas and alack! &#8212; are powerless before the awesome power of writers entitled by their mandates.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Do see Somerby for <a href="http://dailyhowler.com/dh060105.shtml">a nice dissection</a> of Okrent.</p>
