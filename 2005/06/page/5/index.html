                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Heritage Foundation lists <a href="http://www.heritage.org/About/Staff/TimKane.cfm">Tim Kane</a> as its expert on labor economics.  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,158745,00.html">Fox News</a> shows once again that “fair and balanced” reporting means Bush cheerleading:</p>
<blockquote><p>Leave aside the fact that jobs are only one of the measures of economic performance. The rapid growth rate in GDP, stable inflation, a housing boom, and world-beating productivity growth are all just as important and are clearly successes for Bush. But even if jobs are the sole measure, Bush’s first term is still one of the best ever.  First off, the Bush years ended with more Americans working than ever before. The answer is clouded, however, by a lingering controversy over which of the two Labor Department surveys mentioned above is the best measure of job creation. The payroll survey, which polls employers, indicates a razor-thin gain of 120,000 jobs between January 2001 and January 2005. The household survey, which contacts workers directly, indicates a net increase of roughly 2.5 million employed. Which is correct?</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, average annual real GDP growth of only 2.5% is weak especially if labor productivity growth has been strong.  With high productivity growth but weak output growth, one would expect a weak labor market.  Kane continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2002 and 2003, payrolls were stuck in a “jobless recovery” while the number of working Americans grew by 2 million, according to the household survey. Last summer, the disparity between surveys was so big that the Labor Department had to publicly defend its payroll survey. The household survey said employment was up by 629,000 in July 2004, while payrolls grew a meager 32,000 … Payrolls began their recovery in August 2003, and since then the two surveys seem generally in sync. This doesn’t mean the controversy is over. Something important happened to make the two surveys diverge before August 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kane wants us to believe that the payroll survey is a poor measure of employment growth, while the only problem with the household survey is short-term noise.  Odd that he forgot to mention that the 629,000 jump in the household survey figure in July 2004 was simply amending for the low reported growth even as the payroll survey showed strong month-to-month growth.  Both series showed 1.1 million new jobs from January 2004 to July 2004.  </p>
<p>As far as “something important happened to make the two surveys diverge before August 2003&#8243;, consider the following.  Reported employment appears to have jumped by more than 1 million from December 2002 to January 2003.  However, the employment to population ratio barely increased from 62.4% to 62.5%.  Reported population jumped by 1.156 million from December 2002 to January 2003.  It seems that Kane has also ignored this footnote in the BLS table that reports the Household Survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, and January 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also note that the employment to population ratio was 64.4% in January 2001 and was only 62.4% in January 2005.  Given the attention we have paid to this problem as far as using the Household Survey to gauge employment growth over the years, how can anyone who purports to an authority on labor economics ignore this point?</p>
<p>For more of his writings on this issue, see <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/wm647.cfm">this paper</a>, which includes this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The big shock today was the drop in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent, an excellent indicator of real strength in U.S. labor markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does Kane not realize how much the labor force participation rate has declined?  We could have turned to the nitwits from the National Review for a better discussion than this.  But then an honest analysis would no more likely be aired on Fox News than it would be accepted for publication in the National Review.</p>

                                <p>MMerrill Lynch and Cap Gemini released their 2005 World Wealth Report (pdf <a href="http://www.ml.com/media/48237.pdf">here</a>) this week. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have more to say when I&#8217;ve read the full report; in the meantime, here are some highlights from <a href="http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_7696_8149_46028_48149_48228">the press release</a>:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;The number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) — individuals with a net worth of at least U.S. $1 million, excluding their primary residence — grew by 7.3 percent to 8.3 million, a net increase of 600,000 worldwide. North America led with a nearly 10 percent growth rate to 2.7 million HNWIs, surpassing the 2.6 million in Europe. Asia-Pacific’s growth rate of over 8 percent — to 2.3 million HNWIs — was twice that of Europe.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>As wealth continues to grow, the report notes that HNWIs with financial wealth between $5 million and $30 million are facing particular challenges in managing their increasing net worth. “Those HNWIs, whom we have termed the “Mid-Tier Millionaires” tend to respond to the paradox they are facing, added complexity and their desire to have customized solutions, by increasing the number of specialist providers to manage their wealth,” stated Petrina Dolby, vice president of Capgemini’s Global Wealth Management Practice. “This, as well as the increase in cost of maintaining their lifestyle over all, places additional pressures on performance expectations&#8230;&#8221;
</li>
<li>&#8220;HNWIs continued to benefit from tax reform, with protection from estate taxes steadily rising through the end of the decade, before “sunsetting” by the end of 2010.&#8221;
</li>
<li>&#8220;A combination of factors, including rising inflation and interest rates, is expected to slow global growth and affect the value of financial assets. As a result, global high net worth wealth is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.5 percent over the next five years, reaching U.S. $42.2 trillion by 2009.&#8221;

<blockquote>When I learned that Ohio Republicans had (cough) “invested” $50 million of public funds in rare coins and collectables controlled by a highly connected Republican fundraiser, I thought, this doesn’t look good. When it turned out that <a href="http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/news/state/11844849.htm">$10 to $12 million was missing</a> from the rare-coin kitty, I had similar thoughts. Then, when I saw that the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation had agreed to turn their long-bond fund into a highly-leveraged hedge fund, <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050609/NEWS24/50609003">which ended up losing $225 million out of $350 million</a>, I thought, this is a real problem. The fact that Governor Taft’s office had been informed in October, and was apparently waiting for the $225 Million Fairy to fill the hole, didn’t help&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The disinformation on the alleged free lunch from privatization continues.  <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.com/"> Donald Luskin</a> is asking folks to read <a href="http://www.freemarketproject.org/specialreports/2005/socialsecurity/socsec3.asp">this piece</a> by Amy Menefee.  She tries to claim some sort of leftie bias in the media. She also stumbles when she talks economics:</p>
<blockquote><p>In reality, the president’s plan for personal accounts would operate much like the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a voluntary retirement savings system established in 1986 and used by more than 3.4 million federal employees including Congress. Social Security typically returns just 2 percent or less on payroll taxes paid into the system. In contrast, the Thrift Savings Plan has paid returns averaging 7 to 8 percent over the last 10 years. While it offers more freedom than traditional Social Security through voluntary individual savings accounts, it is designed to minimize risk. “You can’t hurt yourself there if you try,” Donald Luskin said of the TSP. Luskin, chief investment officer for the economic research firm Trend Macro, has written about investing and writes about media coverage of economics for National Review.  With the TSP, “the two biggest mistakes investors make are impossible,” Luskin said. He said investors hurt themselves when they fail to diversify their portfolios and when they choose funds with high fees that eat away at their gains. The individual accounts in the TSP are invested in diversified funds with low fees, and Bush’s plan is modeled on that idea … “What they don’t tell you is you can’t avoid that risk by pooling together and everybody paying for everybody else,” Luskin said. “The least risky thing is to go it alone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I know how to avoid risk – buy indexed government bonds.  But their real return is less than 2%.  Luskin wants us to believe one can get an 8% return risk-free?</p>

                                <p>The GOP was pushing for drilling in ANWAR even when the world market price for crude oil was less than the estimated extraction cost for getting crude oil out of ANWAR.  Currently, the market price for crude is about twice this extraction cost and some analysts expect world prices to remain high.  One <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8154199">Saudi official</a> has a very different view:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saudi Arabia has plenty of oil &#8211; more than the world is likely to need &#8211; along with an increasing ability to refine crude oil into gasoline and other products before selling it overseas, a top Saudi official says. “The world is more likely to run out of uses for oil than Saudi Arabia is going to run out of oil,” Adel al-Jubeir, top foreign policy adviser for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah, said Wednesday … “If we send more oil to the United States and you can’t refine it, it’s not going to become gasoline,” al-Jubeir said. The United States has not built a refinery since the 1970s, and other markets have similarly outmoded or limited refining capacity.</p></blockquote>
<p>He seems to agree with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/increase-in-gasoline-prices-robert.html">Robert Novak</a> on the refinery issue, but <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/cato-conservatives-telling-fairy-tales.html">Mark Thoma</a> informs us that the good folks at <a href="http://www.cato.org/research/articles/taylor-050603.html">Cato</a> do not agree.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Why do people take out an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) when buying or refinancing a house? Many economists would probably argue that it should depend primarily on one&#8217;s expectations for future interest rates: if you think interest rates are very low and are likely to rise, you should lock them in with a fixed rate, while if you think they are likely to fall in the future then an ARM makes more sense.</p>
<p>But there is another possible reason that people may prefer an ARM, in a world where people are credit-constrained: ARMs charge a lower rate of interest, at least initially, and thus enable one to pay more money for a house for a given a monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, take a look at the following chart. The dark and light blue lines show the average interest rate charged on 30-year fixed and 1-year adjustable rate (AR) mortgages since January 2002. Meanwhile, the orange line (measured against the right axis) shows the percent of new mortgages taken out that have an adjustable rate.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/mba_data.jpg"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.mortgagebankers.org/marketdata/index.html">Mortgage Bankers Association</a> data on new mortgage applications.  Data represents the average of the second and third weeks of each month.</p>
<p>Clearly the proportion of ARMs jumped in the summer of 2003, and again the spring of 2004, in response to jumps in fixed interest rates. But the odd thing is that after both jumps in the 30-year fixed interest rate, it then subsquently fell, nearly back to where it started. Yet the proportion of borrowers choosing ARMs over fixed rate mortgages did not fall. The result is that, even though the interest rate on ARMs is about the same as it was in the second half of 2002, and the interest rate on 30 year fixed mortgages is lower than it was then, a far larger portion of mortgages today are ARMs.</p>
<p>In other words, it seems that there has been a secular underlying trend toward ARMs. Now we come back to my opening comments in this post. I would suggest two possible reasons for this trend toward ARMs and away from fixed-rate mortgages: either expectations about future interest rates have changed, or increasing numbers of people have decided to pay more for their house than they can afford with a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t really believe that interest rate expectations have changed that dramatically since early 2003. (Reasonable people could differ on this point, however.)  So to me, the orange line in the chart above tells the story of millions of home buyers who are spending more than they could afford at an interest rate of 5.5-6.0%.  After all, if they could afford their house at 5.5%, and if they don&#8217;t expect interest rates to fall dramatically, then they would have chosen the fixed rate mortgage, not the AR mortgage.</p>
<p>This is bad news, because an interest rate of 5.5-6.0% is not that high&#8230; and yet it&#8217;s too high for many recent home buyers. If 1-year interest rates to rise by just 1.5%, millions of recent home buyers will find their mortgage payments unaffordable. Yet there are plenty of reasonable scenarios that raise 1-year interest rates by that modest amount in the next year or two&#8230; which means that we shouldn&#8217;t find it surprising if millions of recent home buyers soon find themselves unable to afford to live in their own houses.</p>

This economist was likely thinking about <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/09/news/economy/fed_greenspan_testimony/index.htm?cnn=yes"> monetary policy </a>, which has been concerned about the alleged tightening of labor, which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/is-labor-market-strong-or-weak.html">Kash</a> also discussed on Friday.  </p>
<p>If Kash is the Jedi Master of charts, I’m likely the Padawan.  Kash has been busy graphing not just the average workweek and real wages but also real compensation versus productivity – as well as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/are-earnings-rising-or-stagnant.html">this discussion</a> on the various measures of real earnings.  All that is left to the Padawan is to update <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/unchanged-unemployment-rate.html">my chart</a> on why I put less stock in the unemployment rate than the population ratio.   Notice, however, that the employment-to-population ratio did rise a bit last month as the Household Survey showed a much larger employment increase than the Establishment Survey (which was also picked up by one of the National Review’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200506031253.asp">pseudoeconomists</a> who only think they know more economics than Paul Krugman).  Note also that this ratio is still far below the levels enjoyed five years ago.  While I can understand the FED’s reasoning for tight money five years ago (although why George W. Bush and Lawrence Lindsey were proposing fiscal stimulus back then puzzled me), I’m in the camp of those who would argue against tight money now as the labor market still appears weak to me.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ep.JPG"></p>
<p>Kash also noted that DeLong-Samwick dialogue how to read the employment-to-population ratio and the decline in the labor force participation rate – with Brad’s contribution being that compensation has not increased as fast as productivity, which he interprets as a signal that the demand for labor curve has shifted downwards versus Andrew’s implied suggestion that the supply curve has shifted inwards.  In addition to Kash’s charts, let me add this chart of real wages and real fringe benefits using the data source suggested by Brad.  Whether real wages have risen slightly in the last couple of years (Kash’s chart) or fallen slightly (my chart) depends on which subsector we are talking about (albeit<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_05_29_corner-archive.asp#065051">Lawrence Kudlow</a> would have the non-supervisory employees rejoice in the fact the nominal wages rose at all), but the main message seems to be that much of the increase in real compensation comes from fringe benefits such as health insurance premiums, which Kash claims “yield little or no actual improvements in health care for the average person”.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rc.JPG"></p>
<p>Kash later notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But let me reiterate the point that I have made several times now: just because real compensation is rising, that doesn’t mean that people are better off, particularly if nearly all of the gains are just going to paying higher health insurance premiums. This data persuasively illustrates that nearly all of our real compensation gains today (and I do think we&#8217;re seeing them) are being eaten up by the monster that we call a health care system in the US. Until we address the profound inadequacies of our health care system, this trend will only get worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash <em>has</em> made this point several times.  I would like to add a couple of items – one being the implications of this insight for the labor demand / labor supply debate and the other being an attempt to offer a wee bit of empirical evidence drawn from BLS data on Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.  In various papers on the effect of minimum wages, <a href="http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=32&#038;group=mw">Walter Wessels</a> has argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>when employment costs rise, employers may eliminate some fringe benefits such as training, paid insurance, transportation, or parking, so that the total compensation of workers does not rise even though wages increase. Employers may also raise their expectations of workers, including requiring greater work effort, punctuality, and less absenteeism in the workplace.</p></blockquote>
<p>His labor demand = labor supply model asserts that labor demand depends on the cost of the employee compensation package, while labor supply depends on the value to the worker.  Kash is arguing that an increasingly inefficient health care system has drives a wedge between the demand for labor curve and the supply of labor curve.  In other words, there is an adverse supply-side shock from unfortunate policy decisions that have let the health care system become even less efficient.  </p>
<p>The beginning point of my empirical comment comes from the paper by <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1abs.htm">Joseph R. Meisenheimer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paid leave and health insurance benefits also compose large shares of employers’ total compensation costs, with each type of benefit accounting for 6.5 percent of the total cost in December 2003. Increases in health insurance costs have received considerable attention in recent years from both employers and workers. From December 2002 to December 2003, the Employment Cost Index for private-sector health insurance rose 10.5 percent (not adjusted for consumer price inflation). In the prior year, employers’ health insurance costs rose 10.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>While a 20% nominal increase over two years is quite substantial, note that health insurance costs are only a portion of overall fringe benefits.  The following table breaks down real compensation costs (2000$ using BEA’s PCE deflator) into wages, health insurance costs, and other fringe benefits for 2002QI versus 2004QIV.  The reported Real wage increases were a mere 1.4%, while the increase in real health insurance costs was 17.2% even though workers may have received less insurance.  Also note, however, that the real cost of other fringe benefits appear to have increased by 8.3%.  Of course, higher costs are not necessarily an indication of greater value.  Kash’s inefficiency effect appears to be part of the growing wedge between real wages and real compensation cost and possibly a reason for us natural rate of employment-population ratio = 64% types to be more humble in our estimates of how large the Keynesian output gap is.</p>
<p>Alas, the Federal Reserve cannot control the ill-advised actions of our Congress and the White House (although a few of us wish its Chairman would refrain from campaigning for some of these ill-advised proposals).  Those who have to set monetary policy on the basis of whether we are near full employment might wish to ascertain whether the natural rate of the employment-to-population ratio is as high as 64% level I have suggested versus whether this natural rate has declined.  I doubt that the natural rate has declined to 62.7% but I could be wrong.  What I will continue to argue, however, is that looking at the unemployment rate as one’s guide is strange unless one is sure that the labor force participation rate would be once we reach full employment.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>When are the folks at the <em>National Review</em> ever going to understand what this footnote in the BLS Household Survey report on employment means:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, and January 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ask because of who received the first “Jayson Award” from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200506080914.asp">Donald Luskin</a>.  David M. Kiriazis (chairman of the economics department at Frostburg State University in Frostburg, Maryland) writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless nothing else changed, a decline in the unemployment rate could not possibly be explained “entirely” by people dropping out of the labor force. In fact, from June 2003 to Feb 2004, the labor force did decline from 147 to 146.5 million, but the number of unemployed declined from 9.2 to 8.2 million. Hence, the decline in the unemployment rate was mainly the result of more people finding jobs.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, BLS’s reporting for the civilian noninstitutional population had it at 222.509 million for December 2003 but only 222.161 million for January 2004.  Unless one believes that the U.S. adult population declined by about 350 thousand in one month, Kiriazis’s calculations are suspect.  As far as the number of people finding jobs, the employment to population ratio fell from 62.3% in June 2003 to 62.2% in February 2004.  I hope Kiriazis understands our population tends to grow over time so that adding 125 thousand new jobs per month is not going to get us back to full employment very soon. </p>
<p>Since the Jayson Award is dedicated to someone who allegedly caught Krugman in a lie, let’s remember that he was referring to the labor force participation rate, which fell from 66.5% in June 2003 to 65.9% in February 2004.</p>

                                <p>In a comment to Kash&#8217;s post, <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Mark Thoma</a> provided a link to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/opinion/08schumer.html?">op-ed</a> by Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham:</p>
<blockquote><p>DISMAYED by China&#8217;s failure to play fair on free trade, we have offered legislation to impose a tariff on Chinese exports to the United States if Beijing continues to keep the value of its currency, the yuan, artificially low compared with the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3794">Stephen Hanke</a> makes a good case for opposing the tariffs but goes a bit astray with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Washington&#8217;s modern-day mercantilists believe trade deficits can be managed by altering exchange rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is the Chinese Central Bank managing the exchange rate, but Hanke sort of concedes the point arguing that allowing the yuan to float will likely have only a modest impact on relative prices.  <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/06/renminbi_revalu.html">David Altig</a> has more on this issue.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: AB reader Elaine points out <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/08/content_3058361.htm">this story</a> from Xinhua, a Chinese business news organization:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush administration&#8217;s effort to increase pressure on China to overhaul its currency regime got less than rave reviews from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and key central bankers from China, Europe and Japan. Greenspan disputed the contention of U.S. manufacturers that a revaluation of China&#8217;s yuan would make a significant impact on America&#8217;s soaring trade imbalances.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe we should also outsource the reporting of business news to China!</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/how-should-us-respond-to-chinas-peg.html">Mark Thoma</a> continues this discussion and refers to a comment from <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/052005.html">Paul Krugman</a>.</p>
