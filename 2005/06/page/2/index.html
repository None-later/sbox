                                <p>I wish to amend for two errors of omission in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/andrew-roth-lawrence-hunter-explain.html">this post</a>.   The first was not mentioning the same day op-ed from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/pfeiffer/pfeiffer200506230750.asp">Eric Pfeiffer</a>.  While I disagree with much of what Mr. Pfeiffer wrote, I appreciate the fact that his definition of the Social Security surplus included interest income.  The second was my failure to mention that Lawrence Hunter’s coauthor was Phil Kerpen who also wrote <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kerpen200506280918.asp">this op-ed</a>.  </p>
<p>While Hunter-Kerpen omitted the Trust Fund’s interest income, Kerpen now shows the impact of including the interest income.  Alas, Kerpen is not officially conceding that Hunter-Kerpen erred. Instead, he is saying that an analysis the DeMint plan should exclude this income as if DeMint is implicitly proposing to default on the accumulated bonds in that file drawer.  If that is what Senator DeMint is really suggesting, then I can understand how his proposal would reduce the General Fund problem – by diverting assets and the associated interest from the Social Security Trust Fund, which would implicitly be either a benefit cut its proponents do not admit to or a move that would increase any alleged insolvency issue.</p>
<p>We have seen lots of this kind of bait-and-switch accounting from the privatization crowd.  Of course, we have seen lots of bait-and-switch discussions on asset returns such as what we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/kudlow-on-value-of-bonds-in-soc-sec.html">yesterday</a>.  I’m sure Mr. Kudlow knows that a 9% nominal return is not superior to a 3% real return if inflation is 6%.  Alas, the writing from the free lunch crowd seems to be based on the premise that their readers do not know the difference.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Phil Kerpen emailed me asking me to take a look at the document labeled “Stop the Raid – Start the Accounts…Without Adding to the Deficits”, which can be found <a href="http://freeenterprisefund.org/policy.php?polid=2">here</a>.  Notice this document begins by saying the Social Security surpluses are only $69 billion per year, which excludes the interest income.  Mr. Kerpen says the DeMint proposal would not include the current Trust Fund assets, which basically means DeMint is proposing to worsen the solvency issue – not improve it.  Also note that this document is proposing to reduce government spending by over $140 billion per year.  It’s fine for a private citizen to HOPE the GOP led Federal government would be so fiscally responsible – but there is no evidence that President Bush and the House leadership has any intent to follow these proposals.</p>

                                <p>On occasion, <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/">Lawrence Kudlow</a> produces an interesting tidbit of information.  Take the chart at the bottom of his “Stop the Raids, Start the Accounts”, which shows the total nominal return one would have earned on ten-year Treasury bonds had one invested $1000 in 1977.  While the amount of nominal wealth as of 2002 looks very impressive, one should realize that the increase in real wealth would have been less.  </p>
<p>Kudlow writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The accounts would create ownership and much higher retirement investment returns than the current system will provide. Over the very long run Jeremy Siegel’s work shows about a 5 percent annual return for Treasury bonds. Interestingly, since 1977 that return has climbed to nearly 9 percent yearly. Of course these are risk-free bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. It’s a great way to start personal savings accounts. Under current law Social Security surpluses are exchanged for non-marketable Treasuries placed in the Social Security Administration account. The Supreme Court has ruled that we don’t own them. However, by placing marketable Treasuries in a personal IRA we will own them and we will get a better yield for retirement.</p></blockquote>
<p>His odd appeal to the <em>Flemming v. Nestor </em>canard notwithstanding, the bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund earn the same return as marketable bonds held by the public – and they have the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  So any claim of a “better yield” just does not square with the facts.  </p>
<p>Even if Kudlow confuses nominal return with real return (which seems to be his norm), his chart does suggest that the bonds in the current Trust Fund are accumulating value, which is something his Club for Growth colleagues are trying to deny.</p>

                                <p>Is it “Dishonest Dick” or “Deferment Dick”?  I’ll spare you my sermon on how Cheney smeared Senator Hagel as <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/6/26/18480/0163">Kos</a> covers this perfectly.  Kos is rightfully frustrated with this write-up from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/06/23/cheney.interview/index.html">CNN</a> but note this sentence about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They&#8217;re living in the tropics. They&#8217;re well fed. They&#8217;ve got everything they could possibly want,&#8221; the vice president said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same sentence appears in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8357196/">this story</a> along with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The House delegation ate lunch with troops &#8211; the same meal of chicken with orange sauce, rice and okra that detainees were served.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really do not get the point of the second story – of course our Congressional delegation saw no prisoner abuse during their scheduled visit.  And it seems that the stories about Gourmet Gitmo all involve some recipe for chicken.  Is Gourmet Gitmo using a cookbook from the former wife of <a href="http://www.thebaseballpage.com/past/pp/boggswade">Wade Boggs</a>.  Since Mr. Boggs rewarded his clever wife by abandoning her, maybe the DoD should pay her royalties for the use of her recipes.  In the meantime, let’s stop all this nonsense that the detainees are living the good life.  Hopefully, all instances of abuse have ceased but to pretend prison is a tropical vacation is just silly.</p>

                                <p>Some have suggested that the recent surge in home prices could be explained by the drop in interest rates. Recently Dr. Rosen, Senior Economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, made this argument in a Fed Letter &#8220;<a href="http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/fedletter/cfljuly2005_216.pdf">Explaining recent changes in home prices</a>&#8220;. UCSD Economics Professor Dr. Hamilton, of Econobrowser, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/06/what_is_a_bubbl.html">suggested</a> another possible interest rate based model for home prices.</p>
<p>When these models are back tested to older housing data they appear to fail. Historically there are periods of concurrently rising interest rates and home prices and periods of falling interest rates and falling home prices. Does this mean that buyers were making irrational decisions during those prior periods?  Or are the interest rate based models flawed.  The answer may shock some people: Historically interest rates have been largely irrelevant to the price of a house.</p>
<p><strong>An Automobile Example</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you are going to purchase a new car that typically sells for $30 thousand. Maybe you are going to finance the car; maybe you are going to pay cash. Now suppose the dealer offers you a lower financing package. Would you be willing to pay more for the car? If you still decide to pay cash, you wouldn&#8217;t pay more. And if you decide to take the financing you will pocket the savings, buy a nicer car, or add more features.</p>
<p>The interest rate is irrelevant to what you are willing to pay for a particular car.  The same is true for housing.</p>
<p>But the lower interest rate does indirectly have a small impact on pricing, not because it lowers the monthly payment, but because it increases demand.  The lower financing package will attract some potential buyers of less expensive cars to move up. It will also make new cars more attractive to some used car buyers. So the more attractive financing will probably increase the demand for the $30K car and that might increase the price slightly.</p>
<p>Some renters might decide to buy a home due to lower financing costs, just like the example of some used car buyers purchasing a new car. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of American households renting decreased by 1.4 million from 2001 to early 2004. These households have migrated to homeownership probably because of the lower interest rates.  During the same time period over 800K apartment units were removed from the market (probably mostly condo conversions) so the actual increase in demand was about 200K units per year.  </p>
<p>The supply curve for housing is fairly steep so it seems reasonable that the temporary additional demand contributed to the initial increase in home prices.  The home builders responded to this surge in demand by adding more construction.  And, according to the census bureau, the migration from renting to buying ended over a year ago.  Now there appears to be more than adequate supply of new homes and the demand has returned to normal.  So why haven&#8217;t prices flattened out or even decreased?</p>
<p><strong>A Bubble Model</strong></p>
<p>A couple of months ago I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-speculation-is-key.html">suggested</a> a model of how speculation was causing the housing bubble.  The surge in homeownership demand from renters contributed to the initial price increase.  Then speculators started chasing the appreciating assets leading to even higher prices and more speculation.  I suggested there were two types of speculation: Speculation as storage and excessive leverage as speculation.  Buyers that only consider the monthly costs are using excessive leverage, speculating that the price will continue to increase into the future.</p>
<p>My automobile example suggests that what people are willing to pay is more likely based on their household income than their monthly payments.  We can test this hypothesis: here is a graph of household income vs. house prices since 1976:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/IncomeHouse.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/IncomeHouse.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>House prices are from the OFHEO <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPIRegion.asp">House Price Index</a>. Household Income is the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h01ar.html">60% percentile</a> income from the Census Bureau.  The Census data is not available for 2004.</p>
<p>Sure enough, historically house prices have correlated well with household income.  Two previous housing bubbles, the early &#8217;80s and the early to mid &#8217;90s, are clearly shown on the graph.  It took several years to unwind the early &#8217;90s bubble (see: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Housing After the Boom</a> for a short review of the &#8217;90s bust).</p>
<p>UPDATE: My initial graph was to intended to show that housing prices move with household income (as opposed to interest rates).  This additional graph shows the ratio between house prices (1976 = 1) and household income (1976 = 1).  If this is a measure of a &#8220;housing bubble&#8221;, then this graph shows the relative sizes of the previous housing bubbles (early &#8217;80s and early to mid &#8217;90s) compared to today.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/Ratio.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/Ratio.jpg"></a></p>
<p>BACK TO ORIGINAL POST:</p>
<p>Any house price model would have to detect the housing bubbles of the early &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s.  It appears that models based on interest rates fail, whereas housing price models based on actually fundamentals like household income are historically better predictors of house prices.</p>
<p><strong>Future question: Who are the Bagholders?</strong></p>
<p>Professor Hamilton asks this question, If there is a housing bubble, &#8220;[W]hy are banks making loans to people who aren&#8217;t going to be able to pay them back?&#8221;  This is a very interesting question about market failure and moral hazard.  Will it be the American taxpayers again left holding the empty bag like in the S&#038;L crisis?  I will speculate on the answer in the near future &#8211; suggestions are welcome!  Along these lines, from John Maynard Keynes:<br />
<blockquote><em>&#8220;A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, my friend Mike Shedlock is hearing &#8220;<a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/06/warning-bells-from-homebuilder.html">Warning bells from homebuilder suppliers</a>&#8220;.   </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200506240838.asp">John Tamny</a> claims that 10-year Federal bonds are overvalued in what may be the oddest NRO oped on record.  It is true that the recent decline in long-term interest rates is a conundrum, but the market price for bonds is readily explained by its payout structure over its term compared to market yields on similar bonds.  For example – if a 10-year bond is issued today promising to pay $4 per year for 10 years place a face value of $100 at the end of the term and if market yields today are 4%, then this bond’s price today would equal $100.  If market yields in a week decline, the market price of this bond will increase.  Tamny not only suggests Treasury bonds are overvalued, but he also tries to suggest there is some tie to the price of gold, which I simply do not get.  </p>
<p>You might prefer to check out the op-ed from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/carter200506240838.asp">Edward Carter</a> as to what it concedes.  Carter admits that government spending during the first term of President Bush did not decline from 18% of GDP to 16.6% of GDP but actually increased as a share of GDP.  He also concedes that tax revenues declined as a share of GDP.  Yet Carter wants us to believe that fiscal policy will be much more responsible during Bush’s second term.  Again, the reasoning for this claim is something I simply do not get.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Let’s compare Carter’s statement “All it required was holding the average real growth rate of federal spending at 1.2 percent a year through 2006” to what President Bush said on February 27, 2001: “We&#8217;ve increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation”. If real Federal spending grew by 4% per year, the spending to GDP ratio would increase – not decline.  But one could read this sentence they way Trent Lott did the morning after this State of the Union Address: 4% nominal increase translated into a 1% real increase assuming 3% inflation.  But Bush was referring to discretionary spending – not total spending.  So it seems the bait-and-switch was on from the very beginning of Bush’s Presidency.</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200506270902.asp">Michael Darda</a> goes far beyond the claims of Mr. Carter arguing that the Bush tax cuts will increase long-term growth rates by 0.85%.  His evidence seems to be some unidentified analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic analysis of the Bush tax cuts shows that long-run growth could be lifted by 0.85 percentage points as long as the lower-tax schedules on capital and labor remain in place. Ceteris paribus, an additional 0.85 percentage points of growth would augment revenues by $1.5 trillion during the next decade. The rebound in real economic growth since 2003 also suggests the fiscal deficit should fall to no more than 2 percent of GDP during the next year, less than the historical average going back to 1960. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The rise in the global saving rate is more than accounted for by a higher saving rate in emerging economies, particularly in Asia.

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Dan Bartlett went on the morning talks shows to explain that Rove’s speech included this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war; <em><strong>a few</strong></em> liberals <em><strong>extremists</strong></em> saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I put two key parts of this in italics because I received an email from John Kerry that repeats the version of this sentence that our liberal media puts out where the words I put in italics are not included.  As a liberal Democrat – I agreed with what Bob Kerrey said about wishing the DeLenda Plan had been executed in the spring of 2001 (that is as soon as President Bush knew bin Laden was responsible for the Cole bombing) rather than the fall of 2001.  If Bartlett’s version of what Karl really said is correct, then I’m relieved he was not attacking my philosophy.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Let’s turn the microphone over to Senator Kerry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make America Safe, Not Divided (Excerpts of remarks by Senator John Kerry on the Senate floor on Thursday, June 23)</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us here will ever forget the hours after September 11&#8230; and the remarkable response of the American people as we came together as one to answer the attack on our homeland&#8230;. [I]t brought out the best of all of us in America. <br />That spirit of our country should never be reduced to a cheap, divisive political applause line from anyone who speaks for the President of the United States. <br />I am proud, as my colleagues on this side are, that after September 11, all of the people of this country rallied to President Bush&#8217;s call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats, there were no Republicans, there were only Americans. That is why it is really hard to believe that last night in New York&#8230; the most senior adviser to the President of the United States [was] purposely twisting those days of unity in order to divide us for political gain. <br />Rather than focusing attention on Osama bin Laden and finding him or rather than focusing attention on just smashing al-Qaida and uniting our effort, as we have been, he is, instead, challenging the patriotism of every American who is every bit as committed to fighting terror as is he. <br />Just days after 9/11, the Senate voted 98 to nothing, and the House voted 420 to 1, to authorize President Bush to use all necessary and appropriate force against terror. And after the bipartisan vote, President Bush said: &#8220;I&#8217;m gratified that the Congress has united so powerfully by taking this action. It sends a clear message. Our people are together and we will prevail.&#8221; <br />That is not the message that was sent by Karl Rove in New York City last night. Last night, he said: &#8220;No more needs to be said about&#8221; their &#8220;motives.&#8221; <br />I think a lot more needs to be said about Karl Rove&#8217;s motives because they are not the people&#8217;s motives&#8230; They are not the motives of a nation that found unity in that critical moment&#8211;Democrat and Republican alike, all of us as Americans. <br />If the President really believes his own words, if those words have meaning, he should at the very least expect a public apology from Karl Rove. And frankly, he ought to fire him. If the President of the United States knows the meaning of those words, then he ought to listen to the plea of Kristen Breitweiser, who lost her husband when the Twin Towers came crashing down. She said: &#8220;If you are going to use 9/11, use it to make this nation safer than it was on 9/11.&#8221; <br />Karl Rove doesn&#8217;t owe me an apology and he doesn&#8217;t owe Democrats an apology. He owes the country an apology. He owes Kristen Breitweiser and a lot of people like her, those families, an apology. He owes an apology to every one of those families who paid the ultimate price on 9/11 and expect their government to be doing all possible to keep the unity of their country and to fight an effective war on terror. <br />The fact is, millions of Americans&#8230;are asking Washington for honesty, for results, and for leadership&#8211;not for political division. Before Karl Rove delivers another political assault, he ought to stop and think about those families and the unity of 9/11. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This week&#8217;s bid by a Chinese oil company (CNOOC) to buy an American oil company (Unocal) has provoked some interesting reactions in Washington.  Despite the fact that 70% of Unocal&#8217;s oil reserves are in Asia, that it supplies just 1% of US oil needs, and that oil is highly fungible (meaning that oil from one source can and will be replaced by oil from another source at virtually the same price if necessary), it seems rather silly to worry about the US becoming more economically dependent on China if the deal goes through.  Which means, I suppose, that I find many on Capitol Hill to be rather silly right now&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062302065.html">The Washington Post</a>: &#8220;House and Senate members demanded an administration review of the bid, required under the Defense Production Act, to determine potential economic and security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/business/worldbusiness/24china.html?pagewanted=1&#038;ei=5094&#038;en=47904fac77c52d73&#038;hp&#038;ex=1119672000&#038;partner=homepage">The New York Times</a>: &#8220;Two Republican congressmen, Richard W. Pombo, chairman of the House Committee on Resources, and Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote to President Bush last week, saying that &#8216;such an acquisition raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security.'&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=877682">A.P.</a>: &#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s not a business transaction at all,&#8217; said C. Richard D&#8217;Amato, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory panel. &#8216;This is not a free market deal. This is the Chinese government acquiring energy resources.'&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose that most of the reason that this deal is provoking such reactions among US politicians (compared to what would be the case if it was, say, a Brazilian company offering to buy a US company) is the idea that this deal would make the US more economically dependent on a country that may someday be an &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the US in some sense.  </p>
<p>Whether it is indeed likely that China will someday be an &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the US is a subject for another day (personally, I&#8217;m skeptical).  But even if you take that assumption as true, the fact is that this deal has virtually no macroeconomic relevance, and that this revelation about US economic dependence on China is coming very, very late. </p>
<p>Given that China&#8217;s government already controls hundreds of billions of dollars of US Treasury bonds &#8211; easily enough to wreak substantial havoc in US financial markets whenever they want to &#8211; the US economy is already extremely vulnerable to decisions made by the Chinese government.  China&#8217;s acquisition of one billion barrels of oil reserves in Asia is nothing compared to the economic influence over the US that they already wield.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why what really worries me about the sentiments coming out of Capitol Hill right now is simply the astonishing economic naivety that they display&#8230; and that these misconceptions have a good chance of leading to bad policy-making. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/well-need-demint-to-pay-for-this.html">Mark Thoma</a> does a nice job of reviewing Andrew Roth’s argument for the DeMint Social Security proposal.  To be honest, I have stopped saying much about these free lunch fallacies as Mark has in general been doing a wonderful job explaining these issues.  </p>
<p>But let me add that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/hunter_kerpen200506230903.asp">Lawrence Hunter</a> makes a <em>little</em> more sense than Mr. Roth:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gradual phase-in of personal accounts funded by the surplus would force Congress to cut spending by the amount it currently takes from the surplus &#8211; about $85 billion a year, or roughly 3 percent of the total $2.5 trillion federal budget. This is easily done if Congress gets serious about spending restraint. Citizens Against Government Waste, the taxpayer watchdog group, recently issued a report identifying $27 billion in pure political pork added to this year’s budget that could easily be tossed over the side in future years.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Hunter has his math all wrong.  3% of $2500 billion is $75 billion – which is about 3 times the amount of pork he mentions.  And his statement about the Social Security surplus being only $85 billion per year seems to be at odds with the accounting provided by <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2093707">Daniel Gross</a> as he points to the last line of table 8 from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/summarytables.html#table8">this document</a>.  Even if Congress had the will to eliminate all of this alleged pork, that pays for only ten cents on the dollar.</p>

                                <p>Greenspan made some reasonable points about US trade with China during his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee today.  First, he said that a yuan revaluation against the dollar probably will do next to nothing to rescue US manufacturing.  Second, he pointed out that tariffs on Chinese products will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Greenspan-China.html?">equally ineffective</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, said some &#8220;mistakenly believe&#8221; that a marked increase in the value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, relative to the U.S. dollar &#8220;would significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of no credible evidence that supports such a conclusion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Some lawmakers in Congress want to impose hefty 27.5 percent tariffs on Chinese goods flowing into the United States if Beijing doesn&#8217;t move to a more flexible currency system.</p>
<p>Greenspan said such tariffs, if implemented, would lower imports from China but would also raise imports from other &#8220;low-cost&#8221; sources of supply in other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. imports of textiles &#8230; assembled computers, toys and similar products would in part shift from China as the final assembler to other emerging-market economies in Asia and perhaps in Latin America, as well,&#8221; Greenspan said. &#8220;Few, if any, American jobs would be protected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I actually have to agree with Greenspan on this one.  I find it hard to believe that even a large change in China&#8217;s exchange rate &#8211; say 30% to 50% &#8211; will suddenly enable US manufacturers of labor-intensive goods to compete with Chinese labor costs.  Likewise for a tariff of 27.5%.  Each of those events may shift the composition of US imports somewhat, away from China and toward other developing countries, and each would make US consumers a bit poorer in terms of purchasing power&#8230; but neither would do much to stop the ongoing transformation of the US economy away from manufacturing and toward other types of production.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, a little more attention to helping those who are losing out in this economic transformation would be most welcome&#8230; though I&#8217;m not going to hold my breath.  </p>
