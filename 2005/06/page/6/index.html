                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I think there&#8217;s some validity to these concerns voiced by the head of Toyota:<br />
<blockquote> OSAKA, Japan (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&#038;storyID=8730854">Reuters</a>) &#8211; The outspoken chairman of Toyota Motor Corp.  said on Wednesday he feared the possibility that U.S. policy could turn against Japanese auto makers if local giants such as GM and Ford were to collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people say the car industry wouldn&#8217;t revisit the kind of trade friction we saw in the past because Japanese auto makers are increasing local production in the United States, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that simple,&#8221; Hiroshi Okuda told a news conference. &#8220;General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are symbols of U.S. industry, and if they were to crumble it could fan nationalistic sentiment. I always have a fear that that in turn could manifest itself in policy decisions,&#8221; he said, speaking as the head of the nation&#8217;s biggest business lobby, the Japan Business Federation.</p></blockquote>
<p>One likely policy change that I could imagine in the face of a potential collapse of GM or Ford would be a government bailout along the lines of the Chrysler bailout.  But I think that Okuda was referring to other types of &#8220;policy changes&#8221; &#8211; e.g. tariffs and quotas on Japanese cars, or even on other Japanese goods.  Such trade protection would be of limited use in the car industry, since so many Japanese cars are now made in the US&#8230; but perhaps they would be combined with higher local (i.e. US) content rules as well.  Of course, a large fraction of Ford, GM, and Chrysler cars are produced outside of the US as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Most worrying of all, however &#8211; and not at all out of the question if a GM or Ford fails &#8211; might be the imposition of across-the-board import tariffs by the Congress.  Such import tariffs would do nothing to help the US current account deficit, but they <em>would</em> help US firms that compete with imports, while at the same time reducing economic growth both at home and abroad&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/frum/frum-diary.asp">Frum</a> argues that Africa does not need financial assistance but might benefit from free trade within the Western Hemisphere:</p>
<blockquote><p>African aid relief is the same. Jeffrey Sachs may imagine that he knows how much it will cost to pull Africa from poverty, but almost nobody outside the UN apparatus and the world of pop culture believes him … Meanwhile, there is something practical that can immediately be done to fight poverty right on America&#8217;s doorstep: Pass the embattled Central American Free Trade Initiative through Congress. But because CAFTA is premised on the unglamorous idea that poverty will be defeated by work and trade, not guilt-induced donations, none of its advocates have ever picked up a guitar in their life. </p></blockquote>
<p>Who to believe – “an internationally renowned economist” (Frum’s words) – or someone who confuses Latin America with Africa?  OK – Frum’s concern seems to be poverty in Latin America but free trade is not a sufficient condition for addressing abject poverty.  If Frum spent less time <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article.asp?aid=11906073_1">criticizing</a> Sachs and more time actually reading what Sachs has written, maybe he’d understand.  And yes, $0.7 billion in new U.S. aid is a far cry from sufficient or being generous.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/7/10421/39349">bgreer</a> comes this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/06/AR2005060601715_pf.html">Washington Post</a> story:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past three years, the Air Force has described its $30 billion proposal to convert passenger planes into military refueling tankers and lease them from Boeing Co. as an efficient way to obtain aircraft the military urgently needs. But a very different account of the deal is shown in an August 2002 internal e-mail exchange among four senior Pentagon officials. &#8220;We all know that this is a bailout for Boeing,&#8221; Ronald G. Garant, an official of the Pentagon comptroller&#8217;s office, said in a message to two others in his office and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Wayne A. Schroeder. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we just bite the bullet,&#8221; he asked, and handle the acquisition like the procurement of a 1970s-era aircraft &#8211; by squeezing the manufacturer to provide a better tanker at a decent cost? &#8220;We didn&#8217;t need those aircraft either, but we didn&#8217;t screw the taxpayer in the process,&#8221; Garant added, referring to widespread sentiment at the Pentagon that the proposed lease of Boeing 767s would cost too much for a plane with serious shortcomings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is leasing more efficient than purchasing?  I guess that depends on how much the annual lease payment is relative to the market price for the old aircraft that was converted into a refueling tanker.  Of course, the most efficient thing would have been to avoid paying Boeing anything for equipment that was apparently not needed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: The financing of this lease deal has an Enron-like <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/030908/8boeing.htm">special purpose entity</a> flavor to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tanker deal isn&#8217;t like most projects, in which the military buys what it needs. It is structured as a lease because the Pentagon didn&#8217;t have enough money to buy both new tankers and expensive new fighter planes. Boeing, for its part, didn&#8217;t want to lease the planes directly to the Air Force &#8211; that would have put too much debt on its books. So the company and the Air Force plan to set up a &#8220;special purpose entity&#8221; to serve as middleman in the transaction. It will collect money from outside investors, use the funds to buy the planes, and then rent the tankers to the Air Force. The result: Boeing gets to book the sale it wants and the Air Force gets its lease. Such complicated financing was alien to Air Force officials. Boeing&#8217;s documents make clear that in crafting the financing plan, the Air Force played student to its contractor. &#8220;The USAF clearly does not understand financing and has asked for our help to educate them (in layman&#8217;s terms),&#8221; wrote Robert Gordon, the vice president of Boeing Capital Corp., in an E-mail message in December 2001. Indeed, Gordon noted, an Air Force general &#8220;made a special comment to thank Boeing for all its work over the past months to try and help this leasing proposal make sense&#8221; to the government. Investigators with the Commerce Committee, however, are not as awestruck. They are examining the financial vehicle that&#8217;s the linchpin of the deal. &#8220;It&#8217;s an Enron-like entity,&#8221; says McCain. For one thing, U.S. News finds, there is a built-in conflict of interest in the arrangement because, documents indicate, it gives Boeing oversight of its own deal. Boeing and the Air Force have sold the deal to Congress as a way to save money, but lease terms mean it&#8217;s impossible to say today how much the government will pay tomorrow. </p></blockquote>
<p>So we elect an MBA President and this is how the government does business?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Greenspan made <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050606/default.htm">some remarks</a> about the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/long-term-interest-rate-mystery.html"><em>Interest Rate Mystery</em></a> during a conference yesterday in Beijing.  Slightly disconcertingly, none of the prevailing theories as to why long-term rates are so low right now are convincing to him&#8230; so he&#8217;s left admitting that he doesn&#8217;t really have an explanation for it.<br />
<blockquote>The pronounced decline in U.S. Treasury long-term interest rates over the past year despite a 200-basis-point increase in our federal funds rate is clearly without recent precedent&#8230;</p>
<p>In March of this year, market participants&#8230; bid up long-term rates, but as occurred last year, forces came into play to make those increases short lived. But what are those forces? Clearly, they are not operating solely in the United States. Long-term rates have moved lower virtually everywhere. Except in Japan, rates among the other foreign Group of Seven countries have declined notably more than have rates in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>So exactly why does Greenspan say that none of the prevailing theories explain the mystery?  Here&#8217;s the summary:
<ol>
<li><em>Low long-term rates signal expectations of future economic weakness.</em>  Perhaps this is part of the story, but Greenspan&#8217;s not convinced: &#8220;periodic signs of buoyancy in some areas of the global economy have not arrested the fall in rates.&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Pension funds are scrambling to make up for unfunded liabilities by dumping money into long-term bonds.</em>  This explanation also seems insufficient: &#8220;world demographic trends are hardly news, and recent adjustments to funding shortfalls do not seem large enough to be more than a small part of a complete explanation.&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Asian central bank (CB) accumulation of dollar assets has pushed down long-term yields.</em>  Greenspan finds this only a partial explanation: &#8220;given the depth of the market for long-term Treasury instruments, the Federal Reserve Board staff estimates that the effect of foreign official purchases has been modest. Furthermore, such purchases seem an implausible explanation of why yields on long-term <em>non</em>-U.S. sovereign debt instruments are so low.</li>
<li><em>Economic integration has reduced worldwide inflation expectations and, through increased international capital flows, increased the pool of savings going toward long-term debt instruments.</em>  Because this phenomenon is not new to the last year, Greenspan is again unconvinced: &#8220;Although this explanation contributes to an understanding of the past decade, I do not believe it explains the decline of long-term interest rates over the past year despite rising short-term rates.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>So what&#8217;s his conclusion?<br />
<blockquote>The economic and financial world is changing in ways that we still do not fully comprehend. Policymakers accordingly cannot always count on an ability to anticipate potentially adverse developments sufficiently in advance to effectively address them.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, this isn&#8217;t a terribly reassuring comment from the world&#8217;s most important central banker, but at least it&#8217;s honest.  Personally, I find theories #2 and #4 completely unconvincing as well, since those both describe long-term trends, not things that have changed in the past 12 months.  So I suppose I&#8217;d guess that forces #1 and #3 may be acting together, each contributing part of the explanation.  </p>
<p>Let me mention one possibility worth thinking more about in defense of theory #3 in particular: if long-term bonds of the US and other countries are fairly good substitutes for each other, and if Asian CB purchases of US bonds are driving down US interest rates, then this would also be expected to indirectly drive down interest rates in other countries by inducing private capital flows into non-US government bonds.  Of course, in order to have a significant effect on worldwide long-term rates the flows from Asian CBs would have to be sizeable compared to the <em>worldwide</em> bond market, not just compared to the US treasury market.  Five hundred billion dollars per year is a lot, but is it enough to move interest rates around the world?  Maybe.  But it&#8217;s a harder case to argue.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, I think we should keep trying to come up with some other possible explanations for the <em>Interest Rate Mystery</em>&#8230; </p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This question is not as easy to answer as it may first appear.  In working on various posts last week I came across an apparent contradiction in the official data on compensation: some series show it rising in real terms, while others show it barely able to keep up with inflation.  This discrepancy was also noted by a few readers, who deserve credit for their sharp eyes.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d take a bit of time to sort out these conflicting data series for myself.  Here’s what I found.  (A warning and apology here: what follows is a relatively econ-geeky post about data details that many may find uninteresting&#8230; and I won&#8217;t be offended if you stop reading here.)</p>
<p>There are three major sources for time series data on earnings:  “Hourly Compensation,” from the BLS’s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/lpc/home.htm">Productivity and Costs</a> (P&#038;C) dataset; the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/ncs/ect/home.htm">Employment Cost Index</a> (ECI), which provides compensation series broken into the two sub-categories of wage/salary earnings and benefits; and the “Average Hourly Earnings” provided in the monthly employment report as part of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/ces/home.htm">Current Employment Statistics</a> (CES).  The following two charts show the behavior of these different series since 1990.  All series express hourly compensation rates in real terms.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_fig1.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_fig2.jpg"><br />Note: all series are expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms using the PCE deflator.</p>
<p>What explains the sometimes substantial differences between these series?  There are several factors that contribute to the discrepancies, but let me point out the most important ones.  (For a more complete description of their differences see <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1abs.htm">this paper</a> by Joseph Meisenheimer in the May 2005 issue of the <em>Monthly Labor Review</em>.) </p>
<p>First of all, two of the series – the CES series and the “ECI: wages and salaries only” series – do not include benefits that workers receive.  In the charts, those are the pink and green series.   Comparing the two ECI series shows that in the past three years or so, a significant gap has opened up between workers’ take-home pay and the amount of compensation that employers are paying, including benefits.  I would argue that this is directly attributable to the soaring cost of health insurance since about 2000.  Even if workers’ pay has been rising in real terms, nearly all of the increases have been going to pay higher health insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Secondly, the different series include and exclude different types of income and different types of workers.  The table below summarizes the different types of workers and income that each series excludes.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_table1.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the ECI differs from the other series in that it comes from a survey that is intended to compare the wage rate in a particular <strong><em>job</em></strong> over time, not the wage rate of a person.  (The sample is 35,000 specific jobs across the country.) In other words, the survey compares what each job in the sample pays at one point in time to what it used to pay earlier.  Furthermore, in constructing the average wage rate across the economy, the ECI holds the number and types of jobs constant at the proportions in the base year (which I believe was just changed from the year 1990 to the year 2000).  What this means is that the ECI will not accurately reflect how a change in the composition of jobs in the economy might affect average wages.</p>
<p>Each of the series thus has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there’s no right answer as to which series is best.  They each tell us slightly different things, and the differences between them tell us still more.  For example, the surge in the P&#038;C measure during the period 1998-2001 probably reflects the large-scale adoption of payments through stock options.  The divergence between the wage/salary series and the total compensation series reflects the growing burden of health insurance.  And the recent rise of the P&#038;C measure compared to the ECI measure may reflect higher rates of compensation growth in for-profits firms compared to non-profit firms, or large increases in the compensation of self-employed business owners, or a change in the composition of jobs in the economy that the ECI hasn’t caught up with.</p>
<p>A note about income inequality: to the degree that some of the excluded groups (in the table above) may have different levels of income than others, the differences between the series may also suggest something about changes in income inequality.  A word of caution about that, however: if you want to find evidence of income inequality, I think there are much better measures (such as the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income.html">Census Bureau’s income data</a>) than these compensation measures.  There is too much else going on in these series to be able to safely attribute anything on the charts above to changes in income inequality.</p>
<p>So what’s my answer to the title question of this post?  Personally, if I had to choose just one series to use it would be the P&#038;C series.  In addition to being arguably the most complete series, it seems to have done the best job of matching my sense about how the economy has done over the past 20 years.  When asked, I think that most people would agree that income growth was indeed much lower during 2002 and 2003 than it had been during the late 1990s; the P&#038;C series bears that out, while the ECI series doesn’t.  Meanwhile, the CES series excludes benefits, which I think are a major part of the story today.</p>
<p>But let me reiterate the point that I have made several times now: just because real compensation is rising, that doesn’t mean that people are better off, particularly if nearly all of the gains are just going to paying higher health insurance premiums.  This data persuasively illustrates that nearly all of our real compensation gains today (and I do think we&#8217;re seeing them) are being eaten up by the monster that we call a health care system in the US.  Until we address the profound inadequacies of our health care system, this trend will only get worse.</p>

                                <p>Yale Economics Professor Dr. Shiller <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/06/shiller-on-npr.html">expressed</a> concern on Friday that the bubble is spreading:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the enthusiasm is infectious and it is starting to spread all over the place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How widespread is the housing bubble? Looking at the OFHEO House Price Index <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/1q05hpi.pdf">data</a> released last week:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/bubble.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/bubble.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>NOTE: The OFHEO provides data for nine regions. <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/censusdefinitions.txt">Here</a> are the states in each region. To make the graph more readable, I reduced the regions to six by combining NE/Mid Atlantic, West and East North Central, and West and East South Central. In each case the trends were very similar.</p>
<p>New England, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific and South Atlantic regions have been partying for some time.  In the last couple of years, the Mountain region has joined the festivities and the South Atlantic region has become one of the party&#8217;s sparkplugs.  Party On!  Now it appears the stodgy regions are starting to perk up.  I wouldn&#8217;t call it a full block party &#8230; yet.  But this is a wild one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not looking forward to the hangover.</p>

                                <p>Christopher Cox (R-CA) represents the district where <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/06/budget-deficit-improves-only-588.html">CalculatedRisk</a> lives.  I suspect both of us are mulling over whether he is the best choice to be the new SEC chairman.  <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2005.06.04.html">Robert Novak</a> does not make a good case for this Presidential nomination.  Just as gets the issues in the Andersen litigation wrong, he tries to make whether we have transparent and honest accounting a partisan issue.  Shorter Novak – Republicans support dishonest CEOs as they are the only ones who can create new jobs.  I think this is unfair to many Republicans who likely agree with Al Hunt.  The close of their debate was classic:</p>
<blockquote><p>NOVAK: I&#8217;m going to send you some editorials from your old publication, &#8220;The Wall Street Journal,&#8221; showing what a danger and what a threat to corporate America and &#8211; who create the jobs. You guys don&#8217;t create the jobs; the corporations do.<br />HUNT: And Bob, I will then send you some very good news stories from &#8220;The Wall Street Journal&#8221; that were frankly &#8211; hope would inform and edify you, because they really are far more in-depth and far more substantive, and that is the last word.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200506031306.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> makes a better case for this nomination that included the following statement, which will likely be controversial:  </p>
<blockquote><p>While the Californian will certainly not roll back the anti-fraud Sarbanes-Oxley provisions designed to tighten corporate accountability and financial management, he is likely to reinterpret some SEC rules in a much more investor- and business-friendly manner than did his predecessor William Donaldson. At times, Donaldson appeared to be contributing to an overly hostile regulatory climate for business. Watch Cox reverse this environment in his first 100 days. That said, Cox will insist on honest accounting and complete accountability from chief executive and chief financial officers. There will be no opening the door to number-fudging under Cox. But just as surely, a number of costly paper-work burdens will be reduced.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the spirit of Sarbanes-Oxley was clearly needed, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/05/sarbanesoxley_t.html">David Altig</a> has been arguing that the Big Four accounting firms have perverted this spirit in creating a fee generating regulatory burdens.  Rent-seekers of the world unite?  </p>
<p>Alas, Kudlow had to spoil an otherwise interesting NRO op-ed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>He’s also no friend of the immediate expensing of options. Instead he believes that free markets are efficient and are constantly pricing in options expenses. Black-Scholes-type option-pricing models are Sarbanes-Oxley overkill. Cox has little sympathy for them, according to Washington analyst James Lucier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, investors factor in publicly available knowledge of revenues and expenses in the pricing of stocks.  But that is the whole point in calling for honest and transparent accounting.  Enron’s stock price factored in the known obligations of the company.  Halliburton’s stock would have been properly valued had the accountants for Richard Cheney’s company known about the change in the accounting method.  And the whole point behind SFAS 123 was to provide investors with timely and reliable estimates of the cost of issuing stock options.  FASB lost the first battle to mandate that these expenses be placed on the income statement, but the 10-K footnote option provides the savvy investor with information at least on an annual basis.  While most financial economists would agree that the textbook version of Black-Scholes tends to overstate the true value of employee stock options, SFAS does not mandate the textbook version be used.  I just hope Cox has a clearer understanding of this issue better than Kudlow.</p>

                                <p>Senator <a href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/05speeches/cr-judicial-nom0510.htm">Feinstein</a> described the role of the Senate in selecting judges on May 10, 2005, which included:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1795, President George Washington nominated John Rutledge to be Chief Justice. Soon after his nomination, Rutledge assailed the newly negotiated and popular Jay Treaty with Britain. Even as Rutledge functioned as Acting Chief Justice, the Senate debated his nomination for 5 months, and in December 1795 the body rejected him 14 to 10, illustrating from the first administration that the Senate has always enjoyed a strong prerogative to confirm or reject nominees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rutledge received his up or down vote but not Stanley Matthews:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, use of procedural delays throughout history has prevented nominees from receiving an up-or-down vote. The claim that it is unprecedented to filibuster judicial nominations is simply untrue. In 1881, Republicans held a majority of seats in the Senate but were unable to end a filibuster to preclude a floor vote on President Rutherford B. Hayes&#8217;s nomination of Senator Stanley Matthews to the Supreme Court. Matthews was renominated by incoming President James Garfield, and after a bitter debate in the Senate, was confirmed by a vote of 24 to 23. This has been described as the first recorded instance in which the filibuster was clearly and unambiguously deployed to defeat a judicial nomination. </p></blockquote>
<p>Feinstein continues with the Fortas filibuster, the Paez filibuster, and the other tactics employed by Orin Hatch et al. to deny up or down votes to President Clinton’s judicial nominees.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20050602-085745-9793r.htm">Lawrence Lindsey</a> wants the next assistant attorney general for antitrust to be an economist.  Like <a href="http://%20economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/should-next-assistant-attorney-general.html">Mark Thoma</a>, I have a mixed reaction to this op-ed.  Let’s start with this rightwing Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc canard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two of the precipitating events for the NASDAQ bubble collapse in the spring of 2000 were the antitrust division&#8217;s suit against Microsoft and the declaration by political leaders that human genome research was the common heritage of mankind.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mark does a nice job of addressing the innovation issues in regards the antitrust litigation pertaining to Microsoft, let’s not forget that the deputy assistant attorney general at the time was an <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd">economist</a> with impressive credentials who co-authored <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Profile/publications/FisherRubinfeld_USvsMicrosoft.pdf">this paper</a> with Franklin Fisher.  </p>
<p>If Dr. Lindsey wants to attribute stock market valuations exclusively to actions of the government such as how human genome research is funded, then let’s consider how the shareholders of two <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AMGN&#038;t=my">biotechnology</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CHIR&#038;t=my">giants</a> have fared.</p>
<p>Dr. Lindsey is on much stronger footing with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we live in a global economy in which a record share of our consumption is produced abroad, and the ease of entry of foreign producers into the United States has never been greater … Second, a much larger share of our economy is idea-based, which makes innovation and new entry easier, and also makes the obsolescence of existing market power happen faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this reasoning far superior to how <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2003_03_02_chronArchive.asp#90408672">Donald Luskin</a> defended the proposed <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/03/dreyers.htm">merger</a> of Nestlé Holdings and Dreyer&#8217;s Grand Ice Cream:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, even granting that the government ought to be concerned with such matters at all, none of it means a thing in this case unless you accept the idea of &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; as a meaningful reality. Who&#8217;s to say that&#8217;s a market of any importance? Who&#8217;s to say that market needs the government to interfere with private business decisions to be sure that there&#8217;s a certain amount of competition in it &#8212; or any competition at all? Let&#8217;s say that there were so little competition in &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; that choice was narrowed to a single brand and prices became astronomical. What if &#8220;the market for superpremium ice cream&#8221; vanished from the face of the earth altogether? So what?</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, Mr. Luskin does not care whether the market quality ice cream is competitive, but my waistline is testimony that I care.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The debate between <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/05/a_defender_of_d.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/05/re-critiquing-krugman-with-friends.html">Andrew Samwick</a> could be characterized as a question of how strong the labor market really is.  </p>
<p>Samwick argues that some ancillary statistics that the BLS reports about the strength of the labor market (e.g. the numbers of discouraged workers, and those who otherwise do not have jobs but would like one) agree with the major statistics that the labor market is improving, and that there are not an unusually large number of people involuntarily out of the labor force.  </p>
<p>DeLong, on the other hand, argues that there are other types of evidence that suggest that the labor market has been very weak for years now, and that Occam&#8217;s Razor therefore suggests that the labor force participation ratio is low because of this weak labor market &#8211; i.e., because people have been involuntarily excluded from the labor market.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/may-jobs-report.html">Today&#8217;s employment report</a> gives me a chance to insert a couple of other bits of evidence into the mix.  The first is the amount of work that people currently holding jobs are being asked to do by their employers: average weekly hours worked.  The second is the real hourly wage that workers are earning.  Both series are shown in the chart below.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/jobs_may05c.jpg"><br />Note: Both series are for nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls. Hourly wage deflated by the PCE deflator. Source: BLS.</p>
<p>Hours worked has not risen much from the low levels of early 2003, and real hourly wages have been stagnant.  Both of these series therefore support the idea that the labor market has been and remains quite weak.  </p>
<p>I therefore think that it is time to accept these two stylized facts:
<ol>
<li>The labor market is indeed weak, by any number of measures.  The demand for labor is unusually low for this point in the business cycle.</li>
<li>According to household surveys, relatively few people consider themselves to be &#8220;unemployed&#8221;, and surprisingly few non-working people say that they would like to work if they could.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we just need to reconcile these two apparently conflicting facts.</p>
