                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>My only request to Santa this year was for us to see an intelligent discussion of the Social Security issue on <em>Meet the Press</em>.  When Tom Brokaw and Ted Koppel decided to grace the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10531436">show</a> yesterday morning, I had thought for a moment that Santa had granted my wish:  <br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT:  Is there a story that you think was underreported this year?<br />MR. BROKAW:  Yes, I do.  I think a big story that was underreported within industrial foundation of America, General Motors may not survive.  That has been the cornerstone of American industry, all those manufacturing jobs in Detroit, the automobile industry defined who we were.  And at the secondary level of that story is &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen with pensions in America and companies and corporations?&#8221;<br />MR. RUSSERT:  A thousand companies&#8230;<br />MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.<br />MR. RUSSERT:  &#8230;have failed pensions.<br />MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.  And the arithmetic is pretty simple.  We&#8217;re either all going to pay for it at great expense or a lot of people are going to get to age 65 and not have the money that they expected to have there. </p></blockquote>
<p>But then Russert said something that had me thinking that he had too much eggnog:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT:  Ted Koppel, I was reading a Government Accountability Office report.  $20 trillion in government liabilities in 2000.  It&#8217;s now $43 trillion in 2004 &#8211; Medicare, Social Security, pensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe Russert was giving another gift to <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=russert+and+%22social+security%22&#038;sa=Google+Search&#038;cof=AH%3Acenter%3BAWFID%3Ac32a032061318778%3B&#038;domains=dailyhowler.com&#038;sitesearch=dailyhowler.com">Bob Somerby</a>. Thankfully, Koppel bailed Russert out with:<br />
<blockquote>But, you know, to follow up on Tom&#8217;s point.  I think the medical care, which is a function of what we&#8217;re talking about &#8211; yes, we have been priding ourselves on having the best medical care in the world&#8211;and you know something?  You can get the best medical care in the world, he can get the best medical care in the world, I can.  Most Americans can&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, most of this alleged $43 trillion long-run shortfall comes from the assumption that Medicare spending has no tax base.  But why not also assume that defense spending has no tax base?  Defense spending is currently running at approximately 4.75% of GDP or $600 billion a year.  Let’s assume a steady state model where real defense spending rises at 2.5% per year and the real interest rate 4%.  By golly, the present value of these expenditures is $40 trillion.</p>
<p>The real problem is that this Administration dramatically reduced taxes even as it was increasing defense spending and enacting a prescription drug benefit.  I guess Russert’s attempt at a point is that we can afford a low tax regime with high defense spending only if we eliminate Medicare.  But we could also afford a low tax regime with the current Medicare program if we eliminate the defense department.  Of course, national security concerns mandate that we maintain at least some level of defense spending, but why can’t Russert even utter the possibility that we increase the tax base?  I guess viewers of <em>Meet the Press</em> will have to wait for a new moderator before we are granted our wish for an intelligent discussion of the Social Security issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_12_25_corner-archive.asp#085452">Tim Graham</a> at NRO’s <em>The Corner</em> must have watched a different episode of Meet the Press than I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>it was a predictable hour of liberal sermonizing. It&#8217;s a scandal that America won&#8217;t raise taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>No Tim – it’s a scandal that the writers at the National Review refuse to admit to their readers than massive Federal deficits are nothing more than deferred tax liabilities that our children will have to pay someday.</p>

                                <p>A recent <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0601.wallace-wells.html">Washington Monthly profile of Kos</a> stirred a debate over the merits of, well, the bulk of what we do here at Angry Bear.</p>
<p><a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_12_18_atrios_archive.html#113528562485802439">Atrios writes</a> that facts, charts, and the like are to some extent pointless in the current environment:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve said this before, but there&#8217;s just little point in detail-oriented grand policy proposals when Bush and Republicans are in office. Just about everything their side offers up involves tax cuts, corporate pork, or cuts to programs that help keep granny from freezing to death in winter. The rest are complete disasters for obvious reason, like the Medicare drug plan, and there&#8217;s really not much to discuss.</p>
<p>If our team actually had some power we could be debating the merits of various universal health care proposals, or considering just how large a minimum wage increase might be appropriate, or various other wonky things. It would be good fun. But we live in an unserious age where the people running the government have no interest in policy and the people not running government have no ability to get anything passed without having anything good about it destroyed by the<br />Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, we spend more time on debunking than &#8220;grand policy proposals&#8221; per se here, because there&#8217;s so much debunking to be done and there is in fact little likelihood of grand proposals going anywhere in the near term.</p>
<p>Kevin Drum offers <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_12/007835.php">a modest defense</a> of the value of wonkery:<br />
<blockquote>My own view is that in addition to activism, which blogs obviously excel at, blogs can also be very good at what I call &#8220;policy-lite&#8221; — short but serious takes on policy issues leavened with enough red meat to make it entertaining. It&#8217;s not the same thing as a Brookings white paper or even a 5,000-word Washington Monthly article, but blogs do provide a forum to educate and inform at a non-expert level in between all the snarkiness and partisan catcalling.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Policy &#8211; Lite&#8221;? Not exactly flattering, but not exactly inaccurate, either</p>
<p>Henry Farrel chimes in with <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2005/12/22/wonkery-or-wankery/">this more vigorous defense</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Not only is a certain amount of wonkishness on the left a good thing in itself, but it can be an important political weapon. Looking back to the Social Security debate, left-of-center blogs played a real role in helping to torpedo Republican proposals – but it wasn’t only the Cossacks (or even Josh Marshall’s information-gathering campaign to separate the sheep from the goats) that did the trick. Wonkish critiques of the bogus figures and rationales that the administration was floating helped shift the public debate from one about a purportedly necessary and inevitable reform, to one about a political ploy that looked like backfiring.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001850.html">Max also weighs in</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Some people are saying that in an adverse political environment, research or policy are not very important. My self-interest here is obvious, but maybe I can still convince you this is a mistaken belief.</p>
<p>One implication that might be drawn from this belief not asserted explicitly is that facts don&#8217;t matter. All that matters is who can shout the loudest. I beg to differ. You may be able to shout, but if what you have to say is crap, the volume isn&#8217;t much of an asset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max even gives two specific examples, Social Security and the purported job-growth-and-tax-cuts relationship, in which both detailed and policy-lite critiques helped inform and even shift the terms of debate away from the Republican-framed talking points.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m clearly not neutral, so it comes as no surprise that I side with Max and Henry. While its demise now seemed inevitable, thinking back to the early days of the proposed reform/privatization of Social Security, it seemed a matter not of if, but when and how bad? the would reform be. Similarly, despite its continuing efforts, I think the administration has failed in its attempt to convince people that the tax cuts stimulated job growth, or even that the overall job market is in good shape. For example, the December WSJ-NBC polls (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/poll20051214.pdf">pdf, subscription required</a>) show that, even as gas prices ease, Bush&#8217;s rating on the economy is a meager 38 approve-54 disapprove.</p>
<p>Two cheers for wonkery.</p>

                                <p>I am happy to report that the <em>National Review</em> is not shying away from saying Merry Christmas as they tout what they call the “Best of NRO Financial 2005”.  Of course, we have had some real fun with a few of their silly op-eds such as <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504150850.asp">John Tamny</a> lecturing Paul Volcker about trade deficits.  Then there are those <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200503041510.asp">free</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200505130848.asp">lunch</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_malpass/malpass200505130836.asp">supply-side</a> types who don’t understand what <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200509120901.asp">Keynes</a> had to say.  </p>
<p>But picking on these amateur economists is not in the holiday spirit.  Besides, their resident <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/canto_ghia200503310855.asp">economist</a> topped all of the rest for confusing the Chinese economy with the U.S. economy as he was trying to explain high oil prices.  But Dr. Canto at least did not confuse economics with <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200508100852.asp">religion</a>.</p>
<p>Given that I have quite a number of old principles of economics text written by Paul Samuelson collecting dust in my office, maybe this should be my Christmas gift to the NRO Financial staff.  </p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!</p>

                                <p>The IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05fallbu.pdf">Quarterly Statistics of Income Report</a> has hundreds of pages of new numbers, but one well respected tax publication provides this summary:<br />
<blockquote>The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts shrunk individual income tax revenues in 2003 despite a rise in taxable income and forced over 400,000 new taxpayers onto the rolls of the alternative minimum tax, according to IRS data released on December 21.  The IRS’s latest Statistics of Income Bulletin showed total individual taxable income rising 2.5 percent to $4.2 trillion from 2002 to 2003. But despite the extra $90 million in taxable income in 2003, the IRS found that total individual income tax collected actually fell 6.1 percent to $748 billion as a result of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA).  “This was the third successive year that total income tax declined,” the report said. “The decline in total income tax for 2003 reflects the reduction in tax rates under JGTRRA.” Total revenue would have declined even further, the report found, had AMT revenues not conversely jumped 38.2 percent, with 23.4 percent more taxpayers paying the tax. “This is largely attributable to the decrease in ordinary tax rates due to JGTRRA, while the tax rates on alternative minimum taxable income remained the same as 2002,” the report said. “Over 0.4 million more taxpayers were required to pay the AMT for 2003.” … The IRS also found that a 23 percent jump in total capital gains and dividends income was responsible for a large portion of the 2003 increase in taxable income, with wage and salary income rising just 2 percent. Capital gains and dividends income received the largest tax rate cuts under JGTRRA, contributing to the decline in revenues. The IRS report found that all income classes but the lowest saw smaller average tax rates in 2003, but that higher-income groups received a much larger percentage tax cut. “The lower average rates for these higher-income returns not only reflect the decrease in tax rates on ordinary income but also a new preferential tax rate for certain qualified dividends and long-term capital gains sold after May 5, 2003, which were introduced in JGTRRA,” the report stated.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/21/AR2005122100748.html">budget-cutting action</a> by the Senate highlights the major problem faced by those who want to cut government spending: it is deeply unpopular to do so. </p>
<p>The &#8216;starve the beast&#8217; notion that cutting taxes leads to large deficits, which in turn forces spending cuts, has already been <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/huh.html">completely</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/starve-beast-theory-revisited.html">repeatedly</a> debunked.  But the difficulty with which the solid Republican majorities in both houses passed tiny, tiny spending cuts ($8 billion per year out of a budget of $2,500 billion per year) is remarkable.  The vote in the House was 212-206, while the vote in the Senate was 51-50.  This highlights the fact that &#8216;starving the beast&#8217; simply won&#8217;t reduce the size of government, because even Republican representatives are reluctant to cut spending.</p>
<p>The reason is, of course, that the American people by and large like the size of the federal government.  They like the things that it spends money on.  And because members of Congress know that cutting spending will be unpopular and hurt their chances for reelection, they won&#8217;t really do it in any meaningful way, no matter how large deficits become.  </p>
<p>One last note, which is really a quibble with the Washington Post.  Their lead paragraph read:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Republicans, by the narrowest margin yesterday, pushed through a major budget measure that would trim federal spending by nearly $40 billion over five years, but they were stymied by Democrats in their effort to open Alaska&#8217;s wilderness to oil drilling.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Major&#8221; budget measure???   I don&#8217;t know any metric by which a change in spending of 0.3% should be called major&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>President Bill Clinton left office in 2001 with a federal budget surplus of $127 billion. President George Bush ran a deficit of $319 billion in 2005. So who deserves more credit for fighting red ink? No question, says Treasury Secretary John Snow: It&#8217;s his boss, Bush. Sipping a latte at a Starbucks coffee shop with reporters in Washington two days ago, he said that &#8220;the president&#8217;s legacy will be one of having significantly reduced the deficit in his time,&#8221; and said Clinton&#8217;s budget was a &#8220;mirage&#8221; and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t a real surplus.&#8221; Snow said the Clinton surplus was inflated by a stock-price bubble and that Bush will be remembered for cutting the gap from a record $412 billion in the 2004 fiscal year.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Government forecasts for continued surpluses depended on those tax payments continuing, Snow, 66, said. “You&#8217;re going to make a lot of mistakes if you forecast based on a bubble,” he said. “Bubbles burst.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a limited but important point in this statement.  If we realize that we have a one-time and temporary piece of goods news on tax collections and one is silly enough to extrapolate some long-run deficit forecast based on the false assumption that this one-time surge is permanent, one will make a mistake.  But that is exactly what this Administration is doing when they claim that current fiscal policy will see a sizeable reduction in the deficit over the next few years.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The need for speed is one of the specious arguments put forth by President Bush for the end-run around the FISA Courts.  Never mind the fact that the FISA Courts act quickly and have approved over 99% of the requests made over the years.  Never mind the fact that the government can wiretap even before getting a warrant.  So I was wondering what the rightwing would come up as their latest in lame excuses for the excesses of this White House – and it seems <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200512191334.asp">Byron York</a> exceeded expectations: <br />
<blockquote>At his news conference this morning, the president explained that he believed the U.S. government had to &#8220;be able to act fast&#8221; to intercept the &#8220;international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda.&#8221; &#8220;Al Qaeda was not a conventional enemy,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;This new threat required us to think and act differently.&#8221; But there&#8217;s more to the story than that. In 2002, when the president made his decision, there was widespread, bipartisan frustration with the slowness and inefficiency of the bureaucracy involved in seeking warrants from the special intelligence court, known as the FISA court. Even later, after the provisions of the Patriot Act had had time to take effect, there were still problems with the FISA court &#8211; problems examined by members of the September 11 Commission &#8211; and questions about whether the court can deal effectively with the fastest-changing cases in the war on terror. People familiar with the process say the problem is not so much with the court itself as with the process required to bring a case before the court. &#8220;It takes days, sometimes weeks, to get the application for FISA together,&#8221; says one source. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so much that the court doesn&#8217;t grant them quickly, it&#8217;s that it takes a long time to get to the court. Even after the Patriot Act, it&#8217;s still a very cumbersome process.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, I thought this was a slap in the face of our government officials – saying they were so incompetent that we had to throw out the Constitution because they could not get their bureaucratic act together.  I was wondering if Mr. York would provide a single example of his thesis – when he did:<br />
<blockquote>Lawmakers of both parties recognized the problem in the months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. They pointed to the case of Coleen Rowley, the FBI agent who ran up against a number roadblocks in her effort to secure a FISA warrant in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, the al Qaeda operative who had taken flight training in preparation for the hijackings.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the same example provided by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/19/AR2005121901027.html">William Kristol and Gary Schmitt</a>, but notice this is a pre-9/11 example.  Let us recall that the bulldog of the Clinton era, Richard Clarke, was hounding Condi Rice at the NSA to break down the bureaucratic barriers and to “shake the trees” but Dr. Rice simply ignored Mr. Clarke.  So the York-Kristol-Schmitt thesis seems to be that her incompetence granted her boss the right to violate the Constitution and our liberties.  </p>
<p>But as I think about it – suppose that we had an effective NSA today (after all, Dr. Rice was moved out of NSA over to head the State Department) that wanted to spy on some anti-war protestor.  I bet that the Administration would find it difficult to write their request for a warrant – especially if that individual was last found protesting a war over <a href="http://ice.he.net/~freepnet/kerry">30 year ago</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/20/AR2005122000685.html">FISA judge</a> resigns in protest.  Also, a few AB readers reminded me that NSA in the alphabet soup of D.C. talk refers to the National Security Agency and not the former <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1851930,00.html">National Security Advisor</a> who to this date has not learned how to tell the truth:<br />
<blockquote>United States secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has denied US president George W Bush ordered illegal domestic spying. However, she would not comment on reports that US phones and e-mails are monitored without court approval.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: AB reader Lena keeps pointing to the Chicago Tribune op-ed from <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/12/21/appeals-court-myth">John Schmidt</a>.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/12/21/appeals-court-myth">Thinkprogress</a> provides the rebuttal.  Which brings up an important point – the rightwing apologists for Bush are parading a host of former Clinton officials as some sort of justification for Bush’s illegal activity.  Even if someone from the Clinton White House said this illegal act was OK by them, I don’t care.  But as Thinkprogress also points out in other posts – the apologists are not being honest in many respects.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>From <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html">Bush’s press conference</a> yesterday, justifying his violation of US laws:<br />
<blockquote>“[I]t was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in a time of war.”<br />“We&#8217;re at war, and we must protect America&#8217;s secrets.”<br />“[T]his is a different &#8212; a different era, a different war.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how centrally Bush is relying on the notion that the US is currently at “war” against terrorists when explaining his authority to override US law (note that the &#8220;war&#8221; he is referring to is not the war in Iraq, but rather the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;), there is one central, crucial question that I think the press corps needs to ask again and again, until it is answered:  <em><strong>When will this “war” end?  </strong></em></p>
<p>Will the US be in a “time of war” forever?  If not, when will the US be able to declare victory in this “war”?  When there is no person left on the planet who would like to commit an act of terrorism?  When there is no person left in the world who would like to harm Americans?  When there are just 10 terrorists left, or 100, or 1000? What are the possible scenarios under which this “war” could be declared to be finished?  Or is this state of &#8220;war&#8221; for the US permanent?</p>
<p>Bush was asked something similar yesterday and refused to answer.  But a straightfoward answer to this question would be hugely illuminating, because the answer would tell us Bush&#8217;s view about when the President will have to resume upholding the laws of the United States.</p>

                                <p>So claims the headline of <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10524120">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Republican House and Senate leaders finalized agreements yesterday on a $41.6 billion budget-cutting plan that includes tough medicine for Medicaid recipients and on a massive defense spending bill that would open the Alaskan wilderness to oil drilling.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s just over $8 billion per year – and as the story continues:<br />
<blockquote>The agreement would cut less than one-half of 1 percent from a projected $14.3 trillion in federal spending over the next five years. Depending on the outcome of negotiations over as much as $60 billion in tax cuts, the savings in spending could vanish.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story goes onto to note how the Democrats are furious that this ANWR provision was stuck in the defense department bill and how certain individuals will lose out from the big cuts in small programs.  I just wish it spent more time talking about the increases in spending for that massive budget given to Sec. Rumsfeld.</p>

                                <p>Consider the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200512190909.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> on monetary policy:<br />
<blockquote>I still can’t forgive the central bank for decimating and deflating the bullish stock market economy five years ago, a move that temporarily ended the great productivity surge of the Internet revolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, the fact that the employment-to-population ratio was over 64% was no indication of a strong labor market.  Just look at the fact that gold prices were near $250 an ounce – so said Kudlow and his crowd.  But the new and improved Kudlow is not calling for tight money even though he thinks an employment-to-population ratio less than 63% is wonderful:<br />
<blockquote>Now, some of my supply-side friends take issue with my optimistic view on inflation. They believe the recent run-up in gold prices to over $500 an ounce signals excess money creation and much more inflation ahead. Therefore, some argue, the central bank must keep tightening and raising its target rate for at least another year. But I believe this is a 1970s view — one that abstracts from the Internet Google revolution and the record productivity surge, and also ignores the global spread of capitalism, which has taken hold in the post-Reagan years and has increased the demand for scarce commodities across the board &#8230; This does not mean that gold is irrelevant as a monetary signal; but it does suggest that the Fed is on the right track with what appears to be a newly created bond-price-rule approach to policy. In other words, the central bank seems to be using the bond market as its leading real-world indicator &#8230; For years, conservative economists have argued for a well-defined price rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>These passages are from someone who has argued in the past for a commodity price-rule.</p>
