                                <p>The cheerleading about the state of the US economy continues unabated from some, particularly those who advocate extending the Bush tax cuts.  See, for example, this typical piece by <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/canto200512090823.asp">Victor Canto</a>), and some of the sentiments bandied about during the <a href="http://blogjam.pajamasmedia.com/archives/2005/12/post.php">Pajamas Media Blogjam</a> (<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/12/blogjam_at_the.html">James Hamilton</a> excluded) that PGL has already <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/savings-and-wealth-james-hamilton.html">commented on</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&#8217;m tired of all of this nonsense about the economy doing better now than it has since the golden days of the Reagan administration.  Recent economic performance is reasonably good by some measures, but nothing unusual for an economic expansion.  If anything, this economic expansion has been somewhat disappointing, compared to historical periods of economic expansion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve assembled the following graphs to (hopefully) lay this issue to rest.  First, GDP growth:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/context1.jpg"></p>
<p>The best 2-year GDP growth of this expansion (of about 4% p.a.) is only average, or slightly below average, compared to what we would expect in an economic expansion. </p>
<p>Prefer a different measure of economic performance?  Then how about industrial production:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/context2.jpg"></p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; recent economic performance doesn&#8217;t look any better there, and may even be a bit worse than previous economic expansions. </p>
<p>Well, at least income has been growing, right?  After all, the White House&#8217;s own press release about the fantastic economy brags that &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051205-1.html">real disposable income is up</a>&#8220;.  Let&#8217;s look at the picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/context3.jpg"></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s true that income is higher than it used to be&#8230; but it&#8217;s also true that income growth has been slowing over the past few years.  Income actually grew faster between 2001-03 than it has over the past two years (not to mention earlier, when income growth was faster still).</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the story we&#8217;re all familiar with, which is the downright lousy  performance of the labor market:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/context4.jpg"></p>
<p>Look, I don&#8217;t think the economy is doing terribly.  It&#8217;s been doing moderately well, in fact.  But compared to what we would expect in a mature economic expansion, the US&#8217;s economic performance is only fair to middling, and the economic growth that we&#8217;ve had has been very uneven, largely side-stepping the middle class.  Certainly, this economy seems to be nothing to brag about.  Nor does it constitute grounds to conclude that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have ushered in the economic golden years.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I tip my hat to <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/12/blogjam_at_the.html">James Hamilton</a> being the only real economist during this <a href="http://blogjam.pajamasmedia.com/archives/2005/12/post.php">Blogjam at the PJ Corral</a>. The recurring theme from Lawrence Kudlow, Andrew Roth, Paul Hoffmeister, and Russ Roberts was that the economy is roaring – all due to Bush’s tax cuts.  Dr. Hamilton, however, properly noted:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t agree that the tax cuts are the key to economic growth in the current setting. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to be trying to stimulate the economy with fiscal policy and contract with monetary policy. What we need is more saving (both national and private saving), and I see no evidence whatever that tax cuts are getting us that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow at one point asked:<br />
<blockquote>Andy Roth, don&#8217;t the new wealth numbers from the Fed show that the tax cuts are working? Aren&#8217;t those wealth numbers, up $12 trillion since 2002, a 31% gain, the real saving rate for the economy?</p></blockquote>
<p>Roth replied:<br />
<blockquote>Absolutely. $12 trillion in new wealth with $4 trillion in new shareholder wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hoffmeister chimed in:<br />
<blockquote>Negative personal savings rates are not a reason for concern when Americans are wealthy (household balance sheets are strong). Low savings rates are a sign of economic vitality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, you may be wondering how wealth is allegedly rising rapidly if savings are negative.  After all, saving is defined as the flow increase in wealth.  Do I need to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">repeat myself </a>?  Look I agree that the National Income Accounts might miss the fact that capital gains may augment savings, but Kudlow, Roth, and Hoffmeister distort matters by considering only periods when capital gains were positive and not negative.  My previous post on this matter suggested that over the 5.5 years from December 1999 to June 2005, both the Kudlow-Malpass-Tamny definition of savings and the National Income Accounts measure said the same thing – real wealth accumulation has been not quite sufficient to keep real wealth per capita from declining.  </p>
<p>But I should update this to consider the increase in wealth from the end of 1999 to the third quarter of 2005.  Nominal wealth per their definition has increased by 21.38%, but the price-level has also increased by 15.64%.  In terms of 2000$, real wealth has risen from $43,267.9 billion to $45,415.3 billion or 4.96%.  Over the same period, the population has increased by 6.09%.  In other words, real per capita wealth is still below where it was at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>Yet Kudlow, Roth, and Hoffmeister dismissed Dr. Hamilton’s concerns about low savings but incorrectly suggesting wealth has risen substantially.  But what else would one expect from a pajamas party?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I have two pet peeves starting with a free lunch claim from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200512070900.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The wealthy pay more in taxes when tax rates fall &#8230; the share of total income taxes paid by the wealthy has risen even as statutory tax rates have fallen sharply.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce’s op-ed notes that the share of Federal taxes that comes from the top 1% of income earners has actually increased – but that mainly reflects the fact that the top 1% is getting a larger share of overall income.  This observation does not prove any alleged increase in their income was caused by lower tax rates.  </p>
<p>But my main pet peeve of the day goes back to the David Cay Johnson argument in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591840198/102-6886317-8272144?v=glance&#038;n=283155">Perfectly Legal</a> that certain tax planners are enabling the rich to avoid taxes.  Chapter 18, which is entitled Letters to Switzerland, was attacked by <a href="http://www.bnatax.com/tm/insights_Reform.htm">this tax attorney</a> who did let us know about section 367(d) and section 482 of the U.S. tax code.  As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/economists-enabling-tax-cheats-why.html">here</a>, effective enforcement of these two sections requires that the IRS have at its disposal economists who understand the concepts of “arm’s-length pricing” and “fair market value” as they apply to the valuation of intangible assets.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to crediting the Bush Administration and the Treasury Department for what they call the “investor model” approach to enforcing these rules.  But it seems the Tax Executive Institute (TEI) is attaching this investor model, which simply put is an application of discounted cash flow (DCF) principles.  A recent publication notes:<br />
<blockquote>TEI said the &#8220;investor model&#8221; concept in the proposed rules &#8220;goes beyond ensuring that buy-in payments are based on an arm&#8217;s-length analysis.&#8221; The model requires that two separate transactions &#8211; the buy-in payment and the cost sharing contribution &#8211; be analyzed as if they were a single investment decision based on an expectation of a given overall return, the group said. At best, this linking of the buy-in and cost sharing contribution is unnecessary to address the IRS&#8217;s concerns, and at worst, &#8220;it deprives a cost sharing participant a fair economic return once that participant has committed to making arm&#8217;s-length buy-in payments,&#8221; TEI wrote.  The institute said the investor model could increase controversy with other nations because it substantially departs from the transfer pricing principles set forth in the existing Section 482 regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>When TEI says the IRS approach deprives a participant with a “fair economic return”, I have to scratch my head as the proposed regulations specifically note that participants should receive:<br />
<blockquote>an anticipated return appropriate to the risks of the cost sharing arrangement over the term of the development and exploitation of the intangibles resulting from the arrangement.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same attorney who criticized Mr. Johnson recently argued:<br />
<blockquote>There is great danger that the discount rate is too small, which causes the external contribution to be overvalued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other critics of the proposed regulations explained:<br />
<blockquote>Although the proposed regulations may not have intended that the default discount rate to be used should be WACC, specifically stating it as an example of one such appropriate rate may lead to the unintended consequence of an IRS examiner applying the WACC as the rate&#8221; in applying the investor model, the business group said. TEI said using WACC could undervalue the cost of capital for discrete projects because the WACC for an entire company &#8220;blends together all the projects a company may undertake,&#8221; while the cost of capital for any specific research effort may be considerably higher than a WACC based on the activities of a diversified company as a whole. </p></blockquote>
<p>Higher maybe – but <em>considerably</em> higher?  Let me explain what this controversy is all about in terms of a simple example.  Let’s suppose you have been paying your U.S. R&#038;D team to develop what you hope to be a hot new technology – writing off their expenses on your U.S. tax return for several years – and today you learn that they have succeeded such that you expect to receive enormous intangible returns for the next 25 years.  In fact, your intangible returns to be earned in the European part of your operations alone are expected to be $1 billion per year from 2006 to 2030.  A tax planner advises you to park the European rights in a Swiss subsidiary so these intangible profits will be taxed at a low rate. </p>
<p>But your tax attorney advises you to address section 367(d) and commission a valuation of the intangible assets with a wink and a nod that his economic guru will place a value equal to something between $2 billion and $3 billion.  Sound a tad low?  Ah come on – isn’t the appropriate discount rate between 30% and 50%?  </p>
<p>An IRS economist might object claiming that the discount rate should only be 10% so the valuation should have been in excess of $9 billion.  But suppose we have very good evidence that your company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 12% not 10%.  And suppose half of the value of your company is due to routine activities (or if you prefer tangible assets) and the other half is due to intangible value and profits.  Couldn’t the appropriate discount rate be as high as the economic guru for the tax attorney?  Well no, since the weighted average of this discount rate and the discount rate for your routine activities must be 12%.  So if the latter is 9%, then the appropriate discount rate is closer to 15% &#8211; not 30%.  Which means that the payment back to the U.S. entity for the transferred intangible asset would be around $6.46 billion not $3 billion.</p>
<p>Now you might argue that estimating discount rates is hard, which is one reason why financial economists such as <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar">Aswath Damadaron</a> use the market value of equity to derive implied equity risk premium.  Damadaron’s approach requires certain assumptions as to expected future dividends (or cash flows depending on the nature of the valuation issue) as well as the assumption known as the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.  The economists at the IRS have been pushing something called the Market Capitalization approach, which is heavily criticized by tax attorneys.  But excuse me – when did the Journal of Finance tells us that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis was junk science.  These same tax attorneys should read the Tax Court opinions in the DHL and Nestle litigations that involved the valuation of intangible assets – as the Court seems to accept the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.  </p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the nonsense that passes for valuation work found during litigations involving Gifts &#038; Estates cases might recognize this controversy over discount rates.  Perhaps the funniest version of this comes from the <em>Estate of Josephine T. Thompson</em> who owned shares of Thomas Publishing Co., Inc.  Both “experts” used a DCF approach but they differed on what the appropriate cost of capital should be.  The expert for the government used a reasonable application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model to suggest a discount rate near 12%, but the “expert” for the taxpayer claimed (with no real basis) that the discount rate should be 30%.  The funny part relates to the credentials of the taxpayer’s expert – he is an attorney who the estate trustee learned about by going on a fishing trip in Alaska.  </p>
<p>I also suspect many taxpayers might find compliance less costly if we economists could get their attorney types to do their jobs and not ours.  Of course, one AB reader who knows a thing or two about these issues might remind me that some economists are too willing to give their clients advocacy answers in order to get their work.  </p>
<p>The article I noted from Robert Cole was supposed to be advice for John Kerry as he ran for President.   For him to note to Senator Kerry this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, the Code now requires that a U.S. taxpayer take into account the full value of U.S. intangible property transferred overseas</p></blockquote>
<p>and then for him to join TEI when the Treasury Department gets around to enforcing sections 367(d) and 482 is just plain hypocrisy.  I’m glad the current Administration ignores Mr. Cole and I hope the next President does so too.</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; Valerie Plame, the CIA officer whose exposure led to a criminal investigation of the Bush White House, spent her last day at the spy agency Friday. Neither the agency nor Plame’s husband would confirm her departure, but two people who have known Plame for a number of years confirmed she was leaving … Plame had served for many years at overseas postings for the CIA, and her employment remained classified when she took a headquarters desk job, traveling overseas periodically. She was an employee in the CIA’s Counterproliferation Division. “Her career was arbitrarily and whimsically destroyed by a mean political trick,” said Vincent Cannistraro, a former chief of operations for the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center … In the preface to the paperback edition of his book, “The Politics of Truth,” Wilson says that he and his wife were the focus of a “Republican smear machine.” … Plame has been cast by Bush administration defenders as “just a desk jockey at the CIA, someone who wasn’t really undercover and a manipulative Mata Hari who aspired to bring down the Bush administration. All of that is false,” said former CIA officer Larry Johnson, a friend of Plame. “At the end of the day, she was betrayed by her own government and they show no signs of remorse.” </p></blockquote>
<p>This career servant defending our national security leaves her job because of a partisan stunt and I have to wonder – why do Dick Cheney and Karl Rove still have their jobs?</p>

<blockquote>After all, tactics which qualify as torture for the anti-crowd shows up in film and television every day. On NYPD Blue, Andy Sipowicz, played by Dennis Franz, smacked around criminals all the time. In Guarding Tess, Nicolas Cage shot the toe off a man who wouldn’t tell him what he wanted to know, and told him he’d keep shooting piggies until he heard what he wanted. In Patriot Games, Harrison Ford shot a man in the kneecap to get the information he needed in a timely manner. In Rules of Engagement, Samuel L. Jackson shot a POW in the head to get another man to talk. In the TV series 24, the heroes regularly use torture and cruelty to get results. They even mistakenly tortured an innocent woman. </p></blockquote>
<p>If Mr. Goldberg ever had the pleasure of meeting Dennis Franz – he’d know the actor in real life is a very decent person.  And portraying what might happen in real life in a television show or in a movie does not mean one condones the activity.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As illustrated in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/spending-growth-in-context.html">my previous post</a>, the growth of federal spending under Bush has actually been quite modest, other than in the categories of defense and health care.  As a result, if we were to try to imagine what the budget deficit would have been with more restrained spending growth, we find that it would have made very little difference &#8211; unless you cut defense spending.  </p>
<p>(Alternatively, one could consider reducing the growth of health care spending, but since that would probably require a fundamental change to the entire health care system in the US, such a scenario is a subject for another day.)</p>
<p>The following chart shows the budget deficit under a few alternative scenarios.  The red line shows the actual and forecast (under the Bush administration&#8217;s 2005 budget proposal, which assumes very tight controls on discretionary spending over the next few years) budget deficit. The light blue line depicts what the budget would have been if all discretionary spending, other than for defense and homeland security, had remained constant at year 2000 levels (i.e. at their lowest levels in 35 years), as a fraction of GDP.   </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/deficit_scenarios1.jpg"><br />Source: The projection of the budget deficit for the rest of the decade is from the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6633&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a>.  Alternate budget scenarios based on the average estimates of the budgetary cost of each of the Bush tax cuts as given <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budgetary-effects-of-bush-tax-cuts.html">here</a>, and historical spending levels as given <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/spending-growth-in-context.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The graph illustrates that because discretionary spending growth has actually been quite modest, holding such NDNHS discretionary spending constant would have made very little difference to the budget deficit. </p>
<p>The dark blue line proposes a different scenario: suppose NDNHS spending had been frozen at year 2000 levels, and defense and homeland security spending (DHS) had risen by only half as much as it did between 2001 and 2005 (again, as a percent of GDP).  So, for example, under this scenario DHS spending would have risen from about $300bn in 2000 to about $465bn in 2005, instead of its actual level of around $535bn.  This spending scenario now starts to put a bit of a dent in the budget deficit.</p>
<p>But the only scenario that actually goes most of the way toward eliminating the budget deficit is if this latter spending scenario is combined with the supposition that the Bush tax cuts had never happened.  </p>
<p>The lesson is fairly straightforward: the deficit was overwhelmingly due to the tax cuts, not spending growth under the Bush administration.  (Note: for more about the effect of the tax cuts on the deficit, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budgetary-effects-of-bush-tax-cuts.html">The Budgetary Effects of the Bush Tax Cuts</a>.)  It is equally clear that any plan that hopes to seriously reduce the US&#8217;s budget deficit will almost certainly have to include a substantial reversal of the Bush tax cuts.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had the pleasure of seeing this very good <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/goodnightgoodluck">movie</a>, which focused on one part of the distinguished journalism career of Edward R. Murrow – his decision to take on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.  Even if you have not seen the movie, the transcript of the March 9, 1954 episode of <em>See It Now</em> can be found <a href="http://www.honors.umd.edu/HONR269J/archive/Murrow540309.html">here</a>. <br />The transcript is not only an interesting read of a troubling point in our history, but also has several implications for the charged environment today beginning with:<br />
<blockquote>Our working thesis tonight is this question:<br />If this fight against Communism is made a fight against America&#8217;s two great political parties, the American people know that one of those parties will be destroyed and the Republic cannot endure very long as a one party system.<br />We applaud that statement and we think Senator McCarthy ought to. He said it, seventeen months ago in Milwaukee.<br />McCarthy: The American people realize this cannot be made a fight between America&#8217;s two great political parties. If this fight against Communism is made a fight between America&#8217;s two great political parties the American people know that one of those parties will be destroyed and the Republic cannot endure very long as a one party system.<br />Murrow: Thus on February 4th, 1954, Senator McCarthy spoke of one party&#8217;s treason. <br />In the last few years, the Bush White House has used our fear of Al Qaeda to not only launch partisan attacks on Democrats but also to justify the invasion of Iraq.  Of course, those of us who question Bush’s Iraq policies have also been accused of treason.  Murrow also documented the smear tactics of Senator McCarthy based on half-truths and how the Senator complained about the “left-wing” press.  Sound familiar?  <br />Murrow ended this show with the following words that ring so true today:<br />We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men &#8212; not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular. This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy&#8217;s methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn&#8217;t create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it &#8212; and rather successfully. Cassius was right. &#8220;The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.&#8221; Good night, and good luck.</p></blockquote>
<p>Murrow put his considerable skills and reputation on the line for this March 9, 1954 show.  My only question is where is the Edward R. Murrow of today?  </p>
<p>I would have had another question related to a claim made in the movie – the suggestion that a young William Buckley offered to carry the water for Senator McCarthy back in 1954.  After all, the National Review is willing to defend all sorts of garbage from President George W. Bush and his minions.  But it seems <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200512061505.asp">Mr. Buckley</a> has basically confirmed he is all too willing to attack good citizens in defense of the worst from the GOP.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: Patrick Sullivan revisits the Angrybear to let us know that PrestoPundit’s smear of Mr. Murrow had to do with the allegation that Laurence Duggan was a Stalinist.  <a href="http://www.betweenthecovers.com/display.php?id=60394">Laurence Duggan 1905-1948: In Memoriam</a> would be an interesting read:<br />
<blockquote>Memorial volume for a brilliant and distinguished young civil servant who apparently committed suicide after two members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Richard M. Nixon and Karl Mundt revealed to reporters testimony that Whittaker Chambers claimed Duggan was a Communist, charges that Chambers himself repudiated. Includes tributes, statements, and transcripts of articles and radio broadcasts by Sumner Welles, Marquis Childs, Eleanor Roosevelt, Edward R. Murrow, Elmer Davis, Archibald MacLeish, and others. Subsequent investigation cleared Duggan of all charges. The affair caused one of the earlist and most forceful denunciations of the Committee.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/thomas200512080835.asp">National Review</a> gives Congressman Thomas space to defend fiscal irresponsibility:<br />
<blockquote>When it comes to financial security, &#8220;continuity and certainty&#8221; are important to America&#8217;s households. They are equally important for job creation and economic growth. It is up to Congress to provide Americans with the certainty needed to create a stable, pro-growth, job-creating environment to allow families to plan, save and prepare for their futures … To assist further economic expansion through business activity, the legislation encourages continued investment in new technologies by extending an expanded version of the research-and-development tax credit for one more year — helping U.S. business to continue to be at the forefront of the global economy. It also extends the higher expensing amount for small businesses for two years, which has freed up money for small-business employers to create new jobs and invest in the economy. It is imperative to move this legislation now to keep intact the tax relief that has resulted in a strong economy and robust job creation. Congress should provide Americans with continued tax certainty and continued opportunities to save for their future needs. </p></blockquote>
<p>I have only two problems with his op-ed.  The first and most obvious comes from the fact that the GOP leadership in Washington has no clue how to sufficiently cut spending in order to make these tax cuts permanent.  The other problem I have is the implicit assumption that we need permanent fiscal stimulus to avoid falling back into a recession.  If we are at full employment (a premise I do not accept) as the Bush cheerleaders are insisting – then isn’t this the perfect time to practice fiscal responsibility?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10372124">Jonathan Weisman</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>The House passed three separate tax cuts yesterday and plans to approve a fourth today, trimming the federal revenue by $94.5 billion over five years &#8212; nearly double the budget savings that Republicans muscled through the House last month. GOP leaders portray the tax bills &#8212; for the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast, affluent investors, U.S. troops serving in Iraq and taxpayers who otherwise would be hit by the alternative minimum tax &#8212; as vital to keeping the economy rolling. &#8220;Our economic policies have done the trick,&#8221; said Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio). &#8220;We are in the middle of one of the strongest economies this country has ever seen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Strongest economies we have ever seen?  Not to toot our own horn, but there are 3 Angrybears who know better.  Now for some sanity as Mr. Weisman reports:<br />
<blockquote>But some budget analysts say the flourish of tax cutting badly undermines the recent shows of fiscal discipline. Last month&#8217;s budget-cutting bill would save $50 billion over five years by imposing new fees on Medicaid recipients, trimming the food stamp rolls, squeezing student lenders and cutting federal child support enforcement. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it makes any sense to go through all the difficulty they just went through with the budget-cutting bill, then give it all back in tax cuts,&#8221; said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group. &#8220;If they want to cut taxes, fine, but they are going to have to cut spending by at least that much to help the deficit, and clearly they are not willing to do that. They have to start looking reality in the face.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s time to toot the horn for <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001819.html">Max Sawicky</a> who provides the evidence that backs Mr. Bixby’s argument up and then some.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_12/007727.php">Kevin Drum</a> thanks <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/12/index.html#008566">Sam Rosenfeld</a> as reports on the political stunts and Bush cheerleader headlines on this issue:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the deal: congressional Republicans have cleverly split next year&#8217;s budget bill (technically a &#8220;spending reconciliation&#8221; bill) in half. In the first half they cut spending and in the second half they cut taxes. The overall result is to increase the deficit, but by splitting the bill in two they make that less obvious. Will our nation&#8217;s headline writers fall for this trick? You be the judge. Here was the Post&#8217;s headline for the first half of the bill: </p>
<p><strong>Senate Passes Plan to Cut $35 Billion From Deficit</strong><br />And here&#8217;s their headline for the second half: </p>
<p><strong>House Passes 3 Tax Cuts, Plans a 4th: </strong><br />Cost Would Outstrip Recent Action on Deficit</p></blockquote>
<p>While Kevin and Sam are somewhat pleased with the subheading for the second half, Kevin suggests this headline:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Senate Passes Plan To Add $94 Billion To Deficit</strong><br />Planned Tax Cuts Would Far Outstrip Recent Spending Cuts</p></blockquote>
