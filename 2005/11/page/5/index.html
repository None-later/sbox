                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Washington Post is not a perfect newspaper.  Along with most major newspapers in this country, it has been guilty of uncritically reporting the administration&#8217;s garbage many times over the past 5 years, particularly when it comes to the administration&#8217;s fiscal train wreck.  But increasingly, the Post is willing to examine the administration&#8217;s statements for accuracy, while the Times is not.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s paper provides a perfect example.  The NYTimes ran <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/politics/12bush.html">one story</a> on its front page about Bush&#8217;s speech yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>In his speech, Mr. Bush asserted that Democrats as well as Republicans believed before the invasion in 2003 that Saddam Hussein possessed banned weapons, a conclusion, he said, that was shared by the United Nations. He resisted any implication that his administration had deliberately distorted the available intelligence, and said that the resolution authorizing the use of force had been supported by more than 100 Democrats in the House and Senate based on the same information available to the White House.</p>
<p>&#8230;Two official inquiries &#8211; by the Senate Intelligence Committee and by a presidential commission &#8211; blamed intelligence agencies for inflating the threat posed by Iraq&#8217;s weapons programs, but stopped short of ascribing the problems to political pressures.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of the fact that many of Bush&#8217;s statements yesterday were demonstrably questionable.  One would think that the President saying things that are untrue would be news, too, but the NYTimes simply reports what he says and leaves it at that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Washington Post ran one story reporting the contents of Bush&#8217;s speech, and then <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101832.html">another front page story</a> that contained the following starting paragraphs:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Asterisks Dot White House&#8217;s Iraq Argument</strong></p>
<p>President Bush and his national security adviser have answered critics of the Iraq war in recent days with a two-pronged argument: that Congress saw the same intelligence the administration did before the war, and that independent commissions have determined that the administration did not misrepresent the intelligence.</p>
<p>Neither assertion is wholly accurate.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s overarching point is true: Intelligence agencies overwhelmingly believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and very few members of Congress from either party were skeptical about this belief before the war began in 2003. Indeed, top lawmakers in both parties were emphatic and certain in their public statements.</p>
<p>But Bush and his aides had access to much more voluminous intelligence information than did lawmakers, who were dependent on the administration to provide the material. And the commissions cited by officials, though concluding that the administration did not pressure intelligence analysts to change their conclusions, were not authorized to determine whether the administration exaggerated or distorted those conclusions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike the NYTimes (which I&#8217;ve almost stopped reading, I must confess), the Post deserves credit for daring to show some evidence that they know how to think and write critically.  If only they had done so years ago&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/market_power_su.html">David Altig</a> cites the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1168.html">Tax Foundation</a> for “evidence” that a windfall profits tax will gather little additional revenue.  David writes:<br />
<blockquote>The shortfall from projected revenues in that picture had a lot to do with missed projections on energy prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>But did the tax on U.S. providers of oil cause Russian and OPEC to start supplying more oil?  Spencer in a couple of good comments fires back at the CBO study, which showed the difference between projected revenues and actual revenues:<br />
<blockquote>Technically, the windfall profits tax was signed into law in April 1980 and remained on the books until 1988. But the tax only collected revenues when the price of crude was above $30 and April 1983 was the last month oil was above $30. So for all practical purposes the effective end of the tax was April 1983 &#8211; because no one had to pay the tax after that point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Williams and Hodge of the Tax Foundation make the following claim:<br />
<blockquote>The answer to the second question, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), is that the 1980s windfall profits tax depressed the domestic production and extraction industry and furthered our dependence on foreign sources of oil … CRS also found the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 percent to 6 percent</p></blockquote>
<p>Spencer has challenged their claim but even if it is true, a 3% reduction in domestic quantity supplied is not the primary cause of the forecast error.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, I hope I was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">clear</a> that I’m opposed to price controls and do not buy into this price gouging spin.  Spencer does not buy into the spin either.  I’m not sure why David associated my advocacy for a gasoline tax with the gouging spinmeisters.</p>

                                <p>You may have noticed (or you may not) that I have remained conspicuously silent on the excellent debate currently going on in the liberal blog world these days regarding the costs and benefits of international trade.  It all started at the <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/">TPMCafe</a> with a debate amongst Gene Sperling, Alan Blinder, and David Sirota, among others, with side commentary contributed by <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113159884896940365">Atrios</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007534.php">Kevin Drum</a>, and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001753.html">Josh Bivens</a>, not to mention a nicely applied quote by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/alan-blinder-v-josh-bivens-on-free.html">PGL</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for my silence is simply this: I&#8217;ve tried writing about this subject in the past, but the degree to which people on both sides seem to be unwilling to listen to each other and actually have a constructive argument, and instead simply throw around unsupported assertions, empty catch phrases, and <em>ad hominem</em> attacks just makes my head hurt.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to keep my remarks on this subject strictly limited.  Or at least, far more limited than they could be, given that I&#8217;ve spent a sizeable fraction of my life studying this subject.  So I&#8217;m not going to try to argue in favor of free trade today.  (If you want to hear some of the arguments I&#8217;ve put forward in the past, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/11/trade-with-china-as-technological.html">here</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/11/trade-and-income-growth-some-data-id.html">here</a>.)  </p>
<p>Instead, let me just try to clear up a couple of misconceptions, with the goal of pushing the debate slightly away from idle speculation and closer to the issues that have actual relevance.  Please consider the following attempts on my behalf to clarify a number of apparent points of confusion:
<ol>
<li>First, let me echo posts on <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113159884896940365">Eschaton</a> and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001753.html">MaxSpeak</a>, which point out that indeed, there are winners and losers from trade, and that the losers are&#8230; well, losers.  ALL ECONOMISTS discussing free trade readily acknowledge this.  In fact, all economists learn about this theoretical reality, known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, in their very first course in international trade, and rehash it in every other course about trade that they ever take or teach during the course of their career.</p>
</li>
<li>Despite its theoretically interesting result, let me suggest that the Stopler-Samuelson theorem doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything about how harmful trade is.  The only thing that S-S tells us is that gauging the benefit or harm from trade is an empirical question.  There could be 1 loser from trade and 300 million winners, or the other way around; S-S simply provides us no good insight. (Okay, that&#8217;s a <em>slight</em> exaggeration, but only a slight one.)  So in the end we have to look at the empirical evidence.  That&#8217;s what the entire debate is about in economics regarding trade: it&#8217;s not about whether there are winners and losers, it&#8217;s about how large the negative effects are and who they fall on, and how large the positive effects are and who reaps them.
</li>
<li>Just as S-S provides a solid (but pretty useless) theoretical result that there are winners and losers from trade, we also have lots of solid theoretical results that show that if you add up the dollars lost by the losers as a result of trade, they would be less than the dollars gained by the winners.  Again, that is a somewhat useless theoretical result, because any economist worth more than their weight in cow manure really cares about a lot more than just the numbers of dollars earned in the economy, as <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_11_06_atrios_archive.html#113163836994543773">Atrios also correctly points out</a>.
</li>
<li>Trade <strong><em>does</em></strong> increase productivity just as surely as technological progress does, and has exactly the same effects.    An improvement in productivity means that a worker (or more generally, the economy) can produce the same amount of output using fewer resources.  Better technology does that.  And <em>so does international trade</em>.  To continue with AB&#8217;s example: Just as tax software makes one accounting firm able to do many more tax returns in a given period of time, thus making each tax return cheaper, farming out tax returns to Indian accountants makes each accounting firm able to do many more tax returns in a given period of time, thus making each tax return cheaper.  Trade is just another way to allow the economy to produce more using fewer resources.  It is no different from technological progress. (See the UPDATE at the bottom of this post for more on this subject.)
</li>
<li>Trade, and the threat of competition from foreign workers, may indeed alter the balance of power between workers and firms.  And that may be a legitimate source of concern.  But if one follows that line of reasoning, one must also acknowledge that trade, and the threat of competition from foreign firms, may indeed alter the balance of power between firms and consumers.  Note that consumers and workers are the same people.
</li>
<li>Economists who generally think international trade is a good idea are not idiots, idealogues, or evil blood-sucking vampires who want to drain the life out of individuals and give it to corporations.  Most of them are people like me, who (as I hope you believe after reading my writing on this blog over the past 2 years) <strong><em>genuinely care about the welfare of individuals</em></strong>.  In addition, economists are in general a group of very smart people (most much smarter than me), who have spent years &#8211; YEARS &#8211; studying this subject to come to the conclusions that they&#8217;ve reached.  So please don&#8217;t dismiss Gene Sperling, Alan Blinder, Paul Krugman, or me, as brain-washed, dumb, heartless jerks just because we think trade generally is a good thing.  (Okay, so maybe I was just gratuitously seizing the chance to include myself in the same sentence with those three&#8230; but can you blame me?)
</li>
<li>Please understand that the vast majority of economists are not in favor of international trade simply because we have the luxury of being insulated from it.  The market for professional economists is probably far more internationally integrated than most markets; we face enormous competition from foreign economists on both the teaching and research side.  I can assert with confidence that if there was no international trade in economic research and teaching, my salary would be far, far higher than it is.  But while it has harmed me personally, I still think the competition is a good thing for the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now to the real question: Why do economists like me, who profess to care about individuals, continue to think international trade is generally a good thing?  (Yes, I know I said I wasn&#8217;t going to get into this&#8230; but let me make just one point&#8230;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the reason: The negative or positive impact of trade is ultimately an empirical question (see point #2 above), and the evidence I&#8217;ve seen in my years of researching this subject suggests that the negative effects are outweighed by the positive.  Actually, to be more precise, the evidence I&#8217;ve seen mostly suggests that the effects of trade are pretty small in a country like the US.  Some people win from trade, and some lose from trade (just as is the case with any new technology)&#8230; but overall, though the effects are small, trade seems to make life better for most people.  Not just for corporations: for <em><strong>people</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As an example, let me just include one graph.  This chart shows one measure of the relative importance of trade in the US economy: imports (excluding oil) as a % of GDP.  Since the biggest fear about trade is that it depresses wages for workers and enriches capitalists, I&#8217;ve plotted real <strong><em>median</em></strong> household income against this measure of imports.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/trade_and_income.JPG"><br />Source: Median income figures from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income.html">Census</a>.  Since Census data only shows take-home pay, I&#8217;ve added benefits to this series by using the BEA&#8217;s data on personal income to estimate the total non-wage benefits received by workers as a % of income.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s a strong correlation between these two variables: more imports are associated with higher household income.  But this graph does <strong>not</strong> prove that trade causes higher income.  In fact, it doesn&#8217;t really prove anything at all.  </p>
<p>However, it does strongly suggest that if trade has a negative impact on median earnings, that impact is very small.  More likely, trade may actually have a positive impact on the median household &#8211; and that&#8217;s what careful econometric research generally shows, and that&#8217;s why I think trade is generally beneficial.  </p>
<p>I could go on, but I&#8217;ll stop here.  Please try to keep these points in mind as you think about and debate this issue.  And please try to respect people who have different opinions from you about this issue.</p>
<p>Okay, now that I&#8217;ve made these points, let the debate rage on.  </p>

                                <p>The accounting problems at Fannie Mae just keep growing.  From <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B599C3873-C705-4698-9298-0BA137E1B288%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">Marketwatch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>NEW YORK (MarketWatch) &#8212; Fannie Mae said Thursday it&#8217;s uncovered new accounting problems in the course of an ongoing review, with the mortgage giant identifying more than $10 billion in issues related to derivatives, insurance accounting and other matters.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Washington-based company, which has previously said it will restate several past periods of financial results, now expects that its 2005 annual financial report won&#8217;t be completed before the second half of 2006.</p>
<p>Fannie also said the New York Stock Exchange is reviewing the company&#8217;s listing since it&#8217;s been unable to file results in a timely manner. It also said the exchange has filed a proposed rule change with the SEC that would allow it to keep Fannie Mae listed.</p>
<p>In the filing, the company said it has identified a problem related to hedge accounting that will lead to an estimated net cumulative aftertax loss of about $8.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few billion here, a few billion there&#8230; pretty soon we&#8217;ll be talking about some real money.</p>

<blockquote>Speaking of trade, wandering through the grocery store today, I noticed that they were selling tax software. This naturally lead me to wonder why it&#8217;s viewed as a great thing when people can do their taxes quickly and cheaply using a computer and software, but a bad thing when people can do their taxes quickly and cheaply using Indian accountants.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bookclub.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/11/9/104721/054">Alan Blinder</a> must have liked this query as well:<br />
<blockquote>It has long been a mystery to economists why so many people view creative destruction that stems from technology as okay, while similar creative destruction that stems from international trade is something to be opposed.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001754.html">Josh Bivens</a> replies:<br />
<blockquote>And I have to raise my hand to being &#8220;opposed&#8221; to both, if thinking that we should be honest about the damage done and calling for efforts to alleviate some of it constitutes &#8220;opposition,&#8221; which sounds to me like par for the course in this debate.There is, of course, a difference between the two: technology can cut a bunch of different ways: sometimes it can favor blue-collar labor (say industrialization in the early 20th century) or it can favor already-privileged workers (economists blame &#8220;skill-biased&#8221; technological change for some of the inequality growth that characterized the 1980s and 1990s. I&#8217;m a skeptic, but it&#8217;s a pretty common belief). Trade, on the other hand, is fully predictable in its impacts on the US: it leads to losses for the worst-positioned and benefits for the already well-off. Blinder is right about something, though; certain types of protectionism do indeed have their most pernicious impact on people in developing countries. It&#8217;s not agricultural subsidies or the MFA, the effects of which are a pretty mixed bag (and whose abolition would benefit US consumers to a much larger degree than the world&#8217;s poorest).</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_11_06_corner-archive.asp#082244">Lawrence Kudlow</a> finally said something I agree with:<br />
<blockquote>While the GOP is attacking oil companies and perhaps reneging on tax-cut extenders, without offering any strong budget-cutting plan, the Dems are thinking about putting together their own Contract with America. While Democrats still have to craft a coherent message, and while their glee may yet be premature, the 2005 election message is clear: It’s time to get serious.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow was noting that we Democrats are happy with last night’s results and any GOP operative who dismisses the voter’s message need to wake up.  He is absolutely correct.  If Kudlow is saying no to price controls on oil, I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">agree</a>.  I also agree that we Democrats need to get busy on crafting our 2006 message.  </p>
<p>Finally, I’m delighted that Kudlow has woken up to the fact that the GOP leadership in D.C. is fiscally irresponsible.  But given the fact that his crowd does not have any spending cuts proposals that would materially reduce a General Fund deficit that is nearly $600 billion a year, how is the GOP supposed to get serious about fiscal responsibility and extend those tax cuts?</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: The junior <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/09/news/economy/oil_hearing/index.htm?cnn=yes">Senator</a> from my state comments on an interesting proposal regarding energy policy:<br />
<blockquote>The contentious hearing came as consumers face a jump of 50 percent or more in home heating bills this winter and gasoline prices have surged 20 percent this year. At the same time, oil company profits have soared. As a result, there have been suggestions in Congress about instituting a windfall-profits tax, with the money distributed to lower-income consumers to help them with energy costs. &#8220;To my constituents, today&#8217;s hearing is about shared sacrifices in tough times versus oil company greed,&#8221; said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. &#8220;Working people struggle with high gas prices and your sacrifices appear to be nothing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Kudlow and I might agree that price controls are the wrong way to go, I’m with Senator Boxer on the proposal to use a windfall-profits tax to reduce the government deficit so we don’t have to rely on taxing the working poor as much.  Larry – care to join me and Senator Boxer?</p>

                                <p>As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/news-roundup.html">Kash reports</a>, the California voters pitched a shut-out at the polls yesterday. Among the various Propositions that I voted no on was <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/ca/state/prop/73">Proposition 73</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Should the California Constitution be amended to require notification of the parent or legal guardian of an unemancipated, pregnant minor at least 48 hours before performing an abortion on the minor?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Attorney General summary read:<br />
<blockquote>Amends California Constitution, defining and prohibiting abortion for unemancipated minor until 48 hours after physician notifies minor&#8217;s parent/guardian, except in medical emergency or with parental waiver. Mandates reporting requirements. Authorizes monetary damages against physicians for violation.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the Sunday night debate that I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/no-on-proposition-77.html">mentioned</a>, Governor Schwarzenegger declined his invitation to debate and sent Tom Campbell as his a surrogate.  The moderators – who were excellent – asked the Mr. Campbell about Proposition 73 only to be reminded that they had agreed not to ask him to give his views.  We learned that  Schwarzenegger’s surrogate apparently was against Proposition 73 but he did not wish to publicly disagree with the governor.</p>
<p>Tom McClintock – who normally is about as straightforward with his rightwing views as it gets – did show.  Even though I might disagree with McClintock on most issues, I have a lot of respect for conservatives who are typically honest.  But McClintock’s defense of this proposal struck me a a bit misleading.  He and I share a couple of things in common.  We both have teenage daughters and we both would hope our daughters would consult their parents on such issues.  McClintock kept worrying that someone who “take” his daughter to an abortion clinic.  I bet his daughter is a lot like mine – no one takes her where she does not wish to go.  If McClintock did not get the issue, a moderator asked him directly – does he want the government to intervene in his family life.  McClintock says he is a libertarian so one would think he would not wish to have the government to intervene in these matters.  So want did this normally straight talking conservative do?  He danced around the question.  </p>
<p>I would say this dancing was pathetic but compare his dancing to Schwarzenegger’s wanting to have it both ways.  Schwarzenegger pretends to be pro-choice but he supported Proposition 73.  And when invited to discuss this issue on the eve of his own call for an election, he sends a surrogate who refuses to even entertain the issue.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, hat tip to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/11/california_elec.html">Brad DeLong</a> for his summary of the various Propositions including why the <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/ink/05/50/news-endorsements.php">LA Weekly News</a> also opposed Proposition 73.</p>

                                <p>In general, the election results yesterday were good for Democrats, liberals, and progressives, and bad for conservatives.
<ul>
<li>Democrats won the governorships of both <a href="http://www.nj.com/elections/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-0/113152143842680.xml&#038;coll=1">New Jersey</a> (unsurprising) and <a href="http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110800371.html">Virginia</a> (a bit more remarkable).  Democrats apparently even picked up seats in the VA state legislature;</li>
<li>In California, Schwartzenegger&#8217;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-election9nov09,0,3181440.story?coll=la-home-headlines">ballot initiatives were defeated</a>;</li>
<li>And in a very rare referendum victory for gay-rights supporters, the people in my own state of Maine voted to uphold a law to <a href="http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/news/state/051109question1.shtml">bar discrimination against gays and lesbians</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, there were some victories for Republicans yesterday, too.  Most notably: in Ohio, all of the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/topstory.php?story=dispatch/2005/11/09/20051109-A1-00.html">ballot initiatives sponsored by reformers failed</a>, with the appeal to reduce the power of the corrupt and scandal-ridden Ohio Republican party apparently falling on deaf ears.  This included a sound defeat of efforts to eliminate gerrymandering in Ohio, something that was also soundly defeated in California.</p>
<p>Personally, I hope that Democrats try to build on these first baby steps regarding the question of redistricting, and that they start making a consistent, principled plea to reduce political gerrymandering.  It could be part of a broad-based stand against the political status quo, in favor or reform, and in favor of a more responsive and representative democracy.</p>
<p>Finally, in other news&#8230; <a href="http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110801211.html">Kansas bravely took a step back</a> toward the good ole&#8217; pre-enlightenment days, when the scientific method was not understood or taught in schools, and when it would have been simply considered &#8220;free speech&#8221; for schools to teach that Newton&#8217;s theory of gravity is &#8220;only a theory&#8221; &#8211; in fact, just one of many equally-likely theories &#8211; and that the theory of gravity is quite controversial since it can&#8217;t explain every single physical phenomenon we observe.</p>
<p>For some reason, after reading about Kansas this morning these words were echoing in my head (see if you can identify the quote without googling): We are engaged in &#8220;a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: On the bright side, voters in Dover, PA, decided that they wanted their science teachers to actually <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/09/tech/main1027359.shtml">teach science</a>.  What a thought.</p>
<p>Also, Josh Marshall shares <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/006961.php">some similar thoughts</a> (to mine) about redistricting.</p>

<blockquote><p>Democrats won hotly contested governor&#8217;s races Tuesday in Virginia and New Jersey on an Election Day closely watched for hints of how the 2006 races might shape up.</p>
<p>The victory in Virginia by Democratic Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine over Republican Jerry Kilgore came despite an appearance by President Bush at a last-minute rally for Kilgore on Monday. The president had rolled up a 9-point victory in the Republican-leaning state in his re-election race last year, but his job-approval ratings there have since fallen into the low 40s.</p></blockquote>
