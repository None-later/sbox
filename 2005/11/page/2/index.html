<blockquote>America must win the war in Iraq. This isn&#8217;t mere rhetoric, or some militant call to arms. It is merely a statment of fact. There is, at present, no way for America to lose the war, because there is no readily comprehensible plan to win.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Iraq war, the White House has brilliantly concealed its purpose, goals, and rationale. Was the goal a democratic Iraq? A stable Iraq? Any Iraq short of outright civil war? One year into the occupation the endpoint of the project was already so muddled it could be any of those of none of them. And therein lies the genius: if you have no set or discernible goal, there&#8217;s no way to fail to accomplish it. And if you can&#8217;t fail, how can you not succeed?</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/grim-milestone.html">noted before</a>, this is one of the reasons it is important for there to be a thorough examination of how and why the Bush administration chose to invade Iraq; we can&#8217;t really know when we&#8217;ve acheived the goals of the invasion until we define what those goals were.  </p>
<p>Was the goal simply to ensure that there were no WMDs in Iraq that could threaten the US?  We&#8217;ve done that.  Was the goal to get rid of Hussein and install a democratic government?  We&#8217;ve done that.  Was the goal to be sure that Al Qaeda couldn&#8217;t use Iraq as a staging ground?  Er&#8230; well, actually, we&#8217;ve done the opposite on that score, turning what was a no-go zone for Al Qaeda into a haven for recruiting, organization, and target practice on Americans.  Or was the goal to create a fundamentally stable, democratic country in the middle east?  That goal, I fear, we will never be able to acheive, at least not on our present trajectory&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2005/11/22/cheneys-question">Chris Bertram</a> provides this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me get this straight. At time t you advocate a policy involving the invasion and occupation of Iraq on multiple grounds, none of which include the forestalling of an Al Qaeda seizure of power in Iraq (since such an eventuality is risibly improbable). At time t+n , as a direct consequence of that brilliant policy, the only options are (a) its continuation or (b) an Al Qaeda takeover of Iraq. Genius. No wonder that man got re-elected.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002645321_normdicks25m.html">Norm Dicks</a> (D-Wash.) shares two things with John Murtha:<br />
<blockquote>During much of the debate, Dicks, a Democrat from Bremerton, huddled in the Democrats&#8217; cloakroom with Murtha, a longtime friend. Both men are known for their strong support of the military over the years … Dicks now says it was all a mistake &#8211; his vote, the invasion, and the way the United States is waging the war.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I thought I’d follow up on the <em>FT</em> story from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/more-skills-needed.html">earlier this week</a> which noted that manufacturers claim that, even though they are laying off large numbers of workers (generally their less-skilled workers, they say), they are still very interested in hiring more highly educated workers such as technicians, engineers, and so forth. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly (at least to economists), the aggregate data suggests that firms have put their money where their mouth is, in a big way.  The phenomenon of substituting away from relatively low-skilled workers and toward relatively highly-skilled workers is widespread and massive.  The chart below (source: <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032004/perinc/new03_000.htm">Census</a>) provides some measures of how more education is rewarded in the labor market.  Clearly, getting more education means that you will be far more highly demanded by firms.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/educ_earnings.JPG"></p>
<p>This reward to education has grown over time. For example, a <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/prs98asc.html">Census Bureau summary</a> of major economic trends in the US over the past half century reported that the median income of workers with at least a Bachelor’s degree was only 35% higher than those with only a HS diploma in 1963.  By 1997 that premium had risen to 88%.  And in 2003 the earnings gain from having at least 4 years of college was over 100% of a HS graduate’s earnings, according to the data cited above.</p>
<p>Perhaps most strikingly, this massive increase in the relative wages that firms pay for a college education has happened at the same time that the supply of college-educated workers has exploded.  In the mid-1960s less than 10% of individuals in the US had a college degree, compared to about 20% in the mid-1980s and about 30% today.  We can only conclude that the demand by firms for relatively well-educated workers has grown even more dramatically than the supply of such workers, which is to say, by a <em><strong>lot</strong></em>.</p>
<p>So clearly the payoff from greater education has risen substantially over the past half-century.  Interestingly, this period also corresponds to a dramatic opening of the US economy to international trade and investment.  One possible conclusion is thus that the forces of international economic integration have made education more valuable.  </p>
<p>However, that is not the only possible reason for the increasing payoff to education.  Technological change that benefits relatively well-educated workers at the expense of the less-skilled is the other most-cited explanation.  You may be interested to note that there was a widespread and lively (okay, at times it was downright vicious) debate among economists during the early 1990s about which effect was larger.  By the late 1990s I think it’s fair to say that most (though by no means all) economists were persuaded that technology played a bigger role than international trade in the relative gains that well-educated workers experienced over relatively less-educated workers.</p>
<p>Regardless, it seems beyond dispute that the way to succeed in the US economy today is to get more education.  And with each passing year, this is only becoming increasingly the case.</p>

                                <p>I guess we can give thanks as we headed out on our commutes to friends and relatives that gasoline prices were not as high as they were two months ago.  Keeping in the spirit of the holidays &#8211; <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/11/windfall_profit.html">James Hamilton</a> declares the windfall profits tax proposal a real turkey as he links to <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/11/gasoline_tax.html">Arnold Kling</a> who summarizes a paper from <a href="http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-02-12.pdf">Ian W. H. Parry and Kenneth A. Small</a>.  Their Does Britain or the United States Have the Right Gasoline Tax, which was published in the September 2005 <em>American Economic Review</em>, suggests that the UK should cut its gasoline tax in half, while the U.S. should double its gasoline tax.  The UK tax rate is around $2.80 per gallon, while the U.S. tax rate is around $0.40 per gallon.</p>
<p>Parry and Small note a variety of driving externalities including pollution and congestion costs.  They also note a Ramsey rational for using higher gasoline taxes instead of higher taxes on employment to fund government spending, which is interesting because the Bush Administration seems to think we can avoid tax increases on either gasoline or labor (or capital income) even as it has no other serious proposals to reduce the massive Federal deficit.  </p>
<p>Given my suggestion that a gasoline tax would be mainly paid out of economic rents from oil suppliers, I was curious as to the relative elasticities of demand and supply in the Parry and Small model.  While they provided various demand-type elasticities, their model assumed fixed supply prices.  In such a model, a higher tax would be fully reflected in the price at the pump with no effect on economic rents.  I guess some liberal politicians might suggest that they have overestimated the impact on prices by assuming a perfectly elastic supply response.  But let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; increases in gasoline taxes would raise the price to consumers, which is why it would tend to reduce pollution and congestion.  I also find it interesting that the British pay more in taxes for their gasoline than we do in total.  </p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Update: MovieGuy must have some devastating critique in store as he is inviting me to provide an update.  All I have for now are a couple of things.  One is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_tax">this</a> interesting discussion of fuel taxes in the UK, U.S., Canada, and China.  The other comes from one my <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">favorite sources</a> for the components of the retail price of gasoline, which reports that the average price was $2.90 per gallon in September and $2.72 per gallon in October &#8211; of which $0.44 was attributable to gasoline taxes.  But here is what I found really interesting.  The contribution from refinery margins dropped from $0.79 per gallon in September to only $0.41 per gallon in October.  In other words, rents for the refinery function dissipated rather quickly.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In today&#8217;s NYTimes, Cornell economist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/business/24scene.html">Robert Frank</a> suggests that perhaps they didn&#8217;t.  He argument consists of two primary elements:
<ol>
<li>Since happiness seems to depend more on relative wealth (compared to one&#8217;s peers, for example) than absolute wealth, and since all of the wealthy are getting wealthier together thanks to the Bush tax cuts, having more money has not really made the wealthier any happier.</li>
<li>The budget deficits that the tax cuts caused have caused a) financial fragility, and b) cuts in government spending on things like medical research, homeland security, and transportation infrastructure.  These budget cuts hurt the wealthy disproportionately, simply because they have the most to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to say that I disagree.  True, the research shows that relative wealth seems to affect people&#8217;s well-being more than absolute wealth&#8230; but an important component of this is the trajectory of one&#8217;s wealth over time.  Rising income and wealth makes people happier.  And the wealthy in the US have certainly enjoyed rising wealth and income thanks to the Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is entirely possible that the tax cuts were large enough that the downsides of budget cuts are small compared to them.  The wealthy have the luxury of essentially insuring against such losses, minimizing their impact.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the possibility of financial crisis: I have yet to see an example of a country where the wealthy suffered more than the middle-class in a financial crisis.  Typically, the wealthy have enough resources to safeguard their assets from financial chaos, while the middle-class does not.</p>
<p>So while I would like to believe Frank&#8217;s argument, simply because it is so roguishly counter-intuitive, I have to confess that I am not sold.  I remain convinced that when the wealthy have lobbied for more tax cuts, they have done so because they are very well aware of their own self-interest.  And as they have received tax cut after tax cut over the past 5 years, they have benefited &#8211; just as they thought they would.</p>

<blockquote><strong>US manufacturing ‘undermined by skills gap’</strong></p>
<p>More than three quarters of US manufacturers say that a scarcity of skilled workers is holding back their business, according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers. The survey of 800 manufacturers showed that 68 per cent were experiencing a moderate skills shortage while 13 per cent said they were suffering a severe shortage.</p>
<p>The complaint comes despite heavy job loses in the sector in recent years and seems ironic in the light of the announcement by General Motors that it plans to cut payroll by 30,000. Since 1998 around 3.4m factory jobs have been lost in the US.</p>
<p>Paul Ashworth, an analyst at Capital Economics, said the apparent paradox reflected the changing nature of US manufacturing. “As global competition is intensifying, US manufacturers are having to migrate higher up the value added chain in order to survive,” he says. “The US is losing a lot of moderate or low skilled jobs but finding it hard to satisfy the growing demand for highly skilled technical workers.”</p>
<p>The National Association of Manufacturers says the problem has been heightened by the exodus of baby boomers from the workforce, a decline in the number of students chosing technical or engineering degrees.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; The House on Tuesday agreed to a $3,100 pay raise for Congress next year to $165,200 after defeating an effort to roll it back. In a 263-152 vote, the House blocked a bid by Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, to force an up-or-down vote on the pay raise. Instead, lawmakers will automatically receive the raise officially a cost of living adjustment as provided for in a 1989 law that barred them from pocketing big speaking fees in exchange for an annual COLA.  Matheson was the only one of 434 House members to speak out against the 1.9 percent COLA, which will raise members&#8217; salaries in January. &#8220;Now is not the time for members of Congress to be voting themselves a pay raise. We need to be willing to make sacrifices,&#8221; he said. The vote came as the House debated a spending bill containing a provision to guarantee a 3.1 percent pay increase for federal civilian workers. The bill, which funds transportation and housing programs and Treasury Department agencies, was scheduled for a final vote later Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that I’m opposed to allowing Congressional salaries to be indexed this way.  In fact, I agree with Tom DeLay:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a pay raise,&#8221; said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. &#8220;It&#8217;s an adjustment so that they&#8217;re not losing their purchasing power.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if he would only use this same logic to the minimum wage!  More from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_11/007622.php">Steve Benen</a> who is doing a very nice job of filling in for Kevin Drum.</p>

<blockquote>Despite clear evidence that the marginal rate cuts of the 1920s, ’60s, and ’80s (not to mention the 2003 tax cuts) led to higher revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>In defense of Tamny, all he is doing is repeating claims from the likes of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/did-stephen-moore-sucker-kevin-drum.html">Art Laffer</a> and his <a href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/09-10-99.html">ilk</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But reductions of federal income taxes in 1924, 1926, and 1928 were each followed by an increase in federal revenues. To some, this seemed proof enough that a tax cut would or could raise the national income and thereby raise the revenue. </p></blockquote>
<p>Many U.S. students of economics can easily rebut the free-lunch supply-side spin regarding the 1981 tax cuts by simply looking at the evidence on Federal tax revenues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Note in particular that Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts increased by over 140% from 1980 to 1990 so all other taxes increased by only 81% in nominal terms. In real terms, tax revenues not including Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by less than 18% even before adjusting for population increases. With a 10% increase in population, real tax revenues per capita excluding Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by a mere 7% over the decade. Of course, one might ask with Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by over 140% in nominal terms. One reason had to do with the payroll tax increase to pre-fund the Social Security benefits of the baby boom generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or one could also simply compare the 3.5% per annum growth in real GDP from 1947 to 2000 (which Larry Kudlow often correctly notes) to the fact that real GDP growth was only 3.0% during the Reagan-Bush41 years.  As far as the 1964 tax cut, most macroeconomic discussions note the return to full employment from an increase in aggregate demand – a Keynesian effect and not a supply-side miracle.  Some macroeconomic textbooks go further to remind us that the fiscal stimulus got out of hand leading to the 1966 Credit Crunch as the Federal Reserve initially tried to offset the surge in aggregate demand.  The rest of this 1960’s with its acceleration of inflation is something the supply-side crowd chooses to omit. </p>
<p>So I’m not surprised that the Laffer crowd goes back to the tax cuts of the 1920’s.  But how would one characterize the macroeconomy of the 1920’s.  If you have read &#8220;Understanding the Supply-Siders&#8221; co-authored by <a href="http://econ.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/CV/twillett-cv.htm">this fellow</a>, you might characterize the 1920’s as being similar to the 1950’s – strong real GDP growth over the decade but plagued with a couple of recessions.  Steve Kangas has also compiled <a href="http://home.att.net/~Resurgence/HISTORICAL_ECONOMIC_STATISTICS.htm"> Historical Economic Statistics</a>, which provides such items as Gross Domestic Product (1929 Dollars) and Federal Receipts and Spending (Billions, 96 dollars).  I have graphed the 1919 to 1929 potion of both series.  </p>

<p>While real GDP grew by 44.4% during this ten-year period, it is interesting to note that real GDP growth was greater in the first half of this period (21.3% increase) than in the second half of the period (19.0%) – as it was the first half of this period that had the higher tax rates.  As far as Federal revenues allegedly rising from the tax cuts, our graph of real tax revenues show no such effect.  And yet, Kemp and Laffer claimed in their October 2000 Wall Street Journal op-ed that real revenues did increase.  It would seem that the supply-side crowd continues to repeat its spin even when it is not true.</p>

                                <p>Congressman Murtha was excellent on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10042399">Meet the Press</a> answering each question quite honestly:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT: In hindsight, do you now believe your vote for the war in Iraq in 2002 was a mistake?<br />REP. MURTHA: Obviously, it was a mistake. I mean, all of us were misled by the information that we had.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it was the line of question that preceded this Q&#038;A that I found most interesting:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT: You think we&#8217;ll be out of Iraq by the end of 2006?<br />REP. MURTHA: I think we&#8217;ll be out of there; if not completely out of there, we&#8217;ll be very close to being out of there. I think we could be out &#8211; yeah, I predict we&#8217;ll be out of there &#8211; it&#8217;ll be 2006.<br />MR. RUSSERT: By Election Day 2006?<br />REP. MURTHA: You &#8211; you have hit it on the head.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right!  We entered this war at a time of Karl Rove’s own choosing – and we shall exit this war at a time of Karl Rove’s own choosing.</p>
