                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Rumors of the housing market&#8217;s demise are probably premature.  </p>
<p>Yes, inventories are rising and price appreciation has slowed &#8211; and even some small price declines have been reported in Boston and anecdotally in San Diego.  Also activity has <a href="http://www.dqnews.com/RRBay1105.shtm">slowed</a> in some areas, like Northern California.  But overall, inventories are still in line with a healthy market (4 months of supply).</p>
<p>Interest rates are also rising, but purchase mortgage applications are <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/11/mba-mortgage-activity-steady.html">steady</a>.  And rates dropped last week for a 30 year mortgage; the first significant decline in over 2 months.</p>
<p>But there are hints that the long awaited housing slowdown has begun.  Anderson Forecast&#8217;s Dr. Thornberg <a href="http://www.edab.org/index.html?BODY=reports.html">wrote</a> in October:<br />
<blockquote>The best indicator that the party is starting to end will be a decline in overall market activity &#8211; slowing of total unit sales and build up of inventories. When inventories rise and sales start to fall this will spill over into price appreciation and construction within three to six quarters, and this is when the overall economy will begin to feel the pinch. Right now the market appears to be at a crossroads. According to the latest numbers available, market inventories in the state have almost doubled over the past six months and overall market activity has been flat albeit at a very high pace. <br />&#8230;<br />&#8230; things are clearly at a tipping point. And remember, while it is unlikely that nominal home prices will fall rapidly, that does not mean a cooling market will do little damage to the economy. A cooling market is characterized by a large drop in new building units, market activity, and refinancing activity, not to mention heightened foreclosure activity. A lot of the new jobs in those areas will suddenly start to disappear. And don&#8217;t forget those wealth effects. When consumers realize they can no longer expect that appreciation bonus to subsidize their consumption habits, they will very likely pull back on spending. Keep an eye out.</p></blockquote>
<p>  The most immediate impacts of a housing slowdown on the economy will be the loss of equity extraction (The Home as &#8216;ATM&#8217;) and the loss of real estate related jobs.  I will revisit the impact of the loss of equity extraction and the &#8220;wealth effect&#8221; in the near future.  <strong>ADDED:</strong> on equity extraction, a funny photo from Mark Thoma: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/11/the_consumption.html">The Consumption Boom</a></p>
<p>For jobs, my blog has excerpts from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/11/housing-and-employment.html">four stories</a> on housing and employment.  </p>
<p>And that brings me to California&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_(California)">Inland Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Of all the areas experiencing a housing boom, the areas most at risk have had the greatest increase in real estate related jobs.  These jobs include home construction, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, inspectors and more.  The following graph uses NSA construction jobs for comparison purposes. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, California has become more dependent on construction than the rest of the country, and construction has really boomed in San Diego.  But San Diego has nothing on the Inland Empire.  </p>
<p>I believe that areas like the Inland Empire will suffer the most when housing activity slows.</p>

                                <p>Actually, I suspect that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/murray200511160844.asp">Iain Murray</a> failed to read the post by <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/11/gas-tax-redux.html">Andrew Samwick</a> before Iain wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita have proved a massive breeding ground for what former OECD Chief Economist David Henderson has termed &#8220;Do-it-Yourself Economics&#8221; (DIYE), which he defines as &#8220;firmly held intuitive economic ideas and beliefs which owe little or nothing to textbooks, treatises or the evidence of economic history.&#8221; … The reason for keeping the price high, the Times asserts, is twofold: to defund the paymasters of terrorism in the Middle East and to combat global warming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Samwick, however, pointed out two papers by Professor Jayanta Sen.  One addressed <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=809466">global warming</a> and the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=792304">other</a> suggested:<br />
<blockquote>A buyer&#8217;s cartel could be formed by the governments of the major oil importing countries like the U.S., Japan, Germany, China, India etc. All oil sold in these countries would have to pass through the buyer&#8217;s cartel. The buyer&#8217;s cartel could negotiate a price with the oil exporting countries, say $10 a barrel (which should be a sufficient markup over production costs). After purchasing oil from the producing countries, the buyer&#8217;s cartel would release the oil in the market and let demand determine the price. If current demand conditions remain unchanged then the price would still remain at $65. However, this would reduce the effective price to the citizens of the importing countries to $10 a barrel as their governments would earn a profit of $55, which could be used to reduce taxes or pay for programs like Social Security. For the U.S. (which imports 10 million barrels a day) the savings would be $55 x 10 million x 365 = $200.75 billion a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Review is so used to writing Do-It-Yourself-Economics, they fail to realize the fact that Dr. Samwick was referring to the writings of an economist at Ohio University.</p>

<p>From the rant:</p>
<blockquote><p>He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the retraction:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Speaker, my remarks were not directed at any member of the House and I did not intend to suggest that they applied to any member.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Murtha IS a member of the House.  Too bad Ohio&#8217;s second district did not send that other Marine to Congress.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: Thanks to AB reader JP for pointing out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/11/18/iraq.plan/index.html?section=cnn_latest">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; The top U.S. commander in Iraq has submitted a plan to the Pentagon for withdrawing troops in Iraq, according to a senior defense official. Gen. George Casey submitted the plan to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. It includes numerous options and recommends that brigades &#8211; usually made up of about 2,000 soldiers each &#8211; begin pulling out of Iraq early next year.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there we have it – the whole furor over Murtha’s proposal was a smoke screen.  The Bush Administration wants to pull the troops home in time for our November 2006 election, but they wanted it to appear to be their idea and not a proposal from the Democrats.  Will the Iraqis be able to maintain order in their nation within a year?  Not likely.  So by his own logic, George W. Bush intends to “cut and run”.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Whereas <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/congress.budgetcuts.ap/index.html">President Bush</a> has praise for the small reduction in overall spending passed by the House arm-twisting hoping to reduce aid for the poor and education, he objects when the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/senate.taxes.ap/index.html">Senate</a> sprinkles in a few energy tax increases to partially offset the tax cut extensions dubbed by Senator Santorum as the <em>Tax Increase Prevention Act</em>.  So neither the GOP Congressional leadership not the White House has any real intention of restoring fiscal sanity.  </p>
<p>So where does one turn at the end of this week for any sense of sanity at all?  Maybe we should go back to Saturday when <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/2005/11/index.html">Michael</a> wrote a speech for a real leader:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We can have a high-service government, with good schools, recreation, humane welfare, excellent environmental policies, and all the rest of it: we&#8217;re rich and lucky. But we can only have those things if we&#8217;re willing to pay the taxes that pay for them. We can also have a low-service government, and leave people to arrange their schooling and other services privately, with low taxes. Of course the rich will have a lot more success at this than the poor, in big houses on large lots with a swimming pool in back, but it&#8217;s a legitimate political choice.  Those are the only two paths for us. There is no high-service, low-tax future for California, and I&#8217;m not going to promise you one. If you want a governor who will lie to you about having good schools, great universities, and up-to-date transportation with no heavy lifting by anyone, you can vote for him in the next election, but this administration is about treating each other like grownups and telling the truth. There is certainly waste and abuse in California; there always is. But there isn&#8217;t anything like enough to pay for what we used to enjoy with the taxes we pay now, even if we could completely stamp it out.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>If one alters California to the United States, this would be the speech that we would like to hear from our President.  Of course, we will have to wait another three-plus years to hear it.  But as Michael explains, he was talking about <em>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Real Failure</em>:<br />
<blockquote>What California needed Arnold to do was to speak some plain truths about the choices facing the state … Of course he said nothing of the kind, and will be remembered as a mountebank and a lightweight.</p></blockquote>
<p>When ARNOLD was campaigning to replace Gray Davis as our governor, I grew tired of the suggestion that ARNOLD was a liberal Republican.  But I also grow tired of the mantra that George W. Bush is a conservative.  ARNOLD and Bush are exactly the same – neither a liberal nor a conservative.  The better description of these two is that they are frauds.  They certainly are not leaders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200511180923.asp">John Tamny</a> remains confused as to the difference between Keynesian business cycles and long-term growth:<br />
<blockquote>Despite clear evidence that the marginal rate cuts of the 1920s, ’60s, and ’80s (not to mention the 2003 tax cuts) led to higher revenues, Sen. George Voinovich (R., Ohio) recently said that “contrary to what some of my colleagues believe, tax cuts do not pay for themselves.” Stealing from the class-struggle line used so effectively by the Democrats, Rep. Mike Castle (R., Pa.) decried tax-cut extension for “reducing programs that could affect the poor and working poor.” … Returning to Lloyd Bentsen, back in 1980 he argued for marginal tax-rate cuts for their ability to improve “the productivity performance of the economy over the long term.” Republicans should intuitively take to Bentsen’s past reasoning, and at least a few Democrats should jump on board too. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Bentsen was also for fiscal responsibility as in finding someway to actually pay for the tax cuts.</p>

                                <p>While <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/lying-just-not-under-oath.html">Kash</a> covers some recent revelations about the 2001 Cheney energy task force, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/11/oil_grilling.html">James Hamilton</a> designs an exam essay question:<br />
<blockquote>Sometimes I like to base exam questions for my students on recent news. Here&#8217;s an exam question to see how thoroughly students understand the economic issues associated with today&#8217;s allegations about oil companies and the Cheney energy task force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hamilton has already received some interesting answers that addressed what might have happened had Congress passed the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/National-Energy-Policy.pdf">Bush proposals</a>. The first question on his exam asked the student to:<br />
<blockquote>Discuss in detail three elements of this plan that led to an increase in oil prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the proposals from yours truly and <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/11/gas-tax-redux.html">Andrew Samwick</a> to impose higher taxes on oil and/or gasoline might be seen as price-increasing whereas the Bush-Cheney proposal was all about subsidizing oil suppliers.  OK, the proposal only used the term subsidy once but talked about tax credits almost 30 times.  The proposal had several other places where taxpayer funds would be used to subsidize energy.  </p>
<p>Which is precisely why I’m elated that it did not pass – and I’m hoping nothing like this boondoggle ever will get through Congress.  Before the average Joe who is paying a lot for gasoline decides that Dr. Samwick and I have gone nuts and the Bush&#038;Cheney were looking out for their interests, let’s consider the incidence of a subsidy when the supply curve inelasticity is very small.  A subsidy might be seen as reducing the price consumers pay but it also increases the amount suppliers receive – with the lion’s share of the benefit accruing to the supplier.  Conversely, a tax along the lines that Dr. Samwick and I are suggesting would slightly increase the price consumers pay but the lion’s share of the impact would be on oil company profits. </p>
<p>Of course, the average Joe might counter that Bush&#038;Cheney lowered their taxes by a modest amount.  But remember that the massive increase in Federal deficits under their watch means deferred taxes have increased a lot.  And who will pay all those deferred taxes?  The shareholders of the oil companies or average Joe?  It seems Bush&#038;Cheney refuse to say.</p>
<p>Then again, the GOP leadership has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/congress.budgetcuts.ap/index.html">twisted</a> a few arms to take food from the mouth of children, which would pay down a few pennies of this staggering debt.  Of course, I may have to eat crow for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gop-split-saves-pork-but-also-saves.html">this</a>.  But hey I own oil company stock and have a good day job, so I can afford some wine with my crow.</p>

                                <p>It seems the war between sensible moderate Republicans and their rightwing party leaders insures that government spending will not be reduced.  <a href="http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/111605/news3.html">Arlen Specter</a> wanted to slash pork barrel spending, which alas angered the conservatives who only pretend to be fiscally responsible:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), has angered colleagues facing reelection in 2006 by cutting $1 billion in pet projects from his subcommittee’s spending bill to pay for programs popular with Democrats and centrist Republicans. Historically, the labor, health and human services, and education bill is one of the most project-loaded of the annual spending bills, say congressional observers who track what they denounce as pork-barrel spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Robert Byrd is also unhappy about proposed reductions in pork.  I guess there is some bipartisan support for loading our kids with deferred tax liabilities.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/11/17/revolt">Thinkprogress</a> notes that the rightwingers wanted the cuts in support for education and assistance to the poor so they could join Senator Byrd in their pork fest.  Pork over assistance to the poor does seem to be the “priorities” of this Administration even as they continue to add nearly $600 billion a year to the Federal debt.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Lawrence Kudlow in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200511171217.asp">What I Learned This Week</a> predicted:<br />
<blockquote>GOP Congress will pass a sizable tax- and budget-cutting fiscal plan</p></blockquote>
<p>More bad timing on Larry’s part.  But what did he learn?</p>
<blockquote><p>The boat-building business is booming, with big backlogs for boats in the $80,000 to $300,000 price range. Why is this important? Prosperity. People buy luxury items when they’ve got the money to do so. This is a very positive economic-growth indicator … Ben Bernanke is a real smart guy with a good idea for a numerical inflation target. But investors were turned off when he testified before the Senate this week in his bid to replace Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems – according to Larry – that Bernanke will follow Greenspan’s lead on making sure inflation does not accelerate.  But wasn’t it Larry’s NRO colleagues that were concerned Bernanke would not be tough on inflation?  I wish the folks at NRO would make up their minds on such matters.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/17/congress.spending.ap/index.html">CNN</a> captures some of the various reactions to the no vote including this one:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans said they may have lost votes because this year&#8217;s bill, down $1.5 billion from last year, included no special projects or earmarks for lawmakers. &#8220;You take those out and you lose the incentive,&#8221; said Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, who voted for the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Congressman Davis saying the only incentive for him to support education and aid to the poor is for Congress to also include pork barrel spending for his fat cat contributors?  Maybe this attitude is what is wrong with our GOP leaders – and their inability to manage our taxpayer money responsibly.</p>

                                <p>Interestingly, Bush and Cheney seem to be quite willing to alienate independent and moderate voters.  Cheney says that people who question the administration&#8217;s handling of Iraq intelligence before the US invasion are &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111601853.html">dishonest and reprehensible</a>&#8220;, while Bush calls those who criticise his decision to go to war when they first supported it &#8220;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-11-17-voa15.cfm">irresponsible</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>It turns out that, in so doing, Bush and Cheney are describing a substantial portion of the American public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm">Polls</a> pretty consistently show that about 55%-60% of the American public now thinks that the Iraq invasion was a mistake.  In fact, about half of those people who now think Iraq was a mistake actually thought that invading Iraq was a good idea in March 2003.  So when Bush tries to demonstrate that some Democrats are &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and &#8220;rewriting history&#8221; by contrasting their statements of support for Bush in 2002 with their current criticisms of Bush, he is also implicitly applying those same labels to the one-third of Americans who have gone through the same disillusionment with Bush&#8217;s Iraq policies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about 55%-60% of Americans now think that the Bush administration misused the intelligence evidence that was available before the invasion, up from around 40% in March 2003.  Cheney apparently think that those people are &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does it seem like a good strategy for the White House to label large fractions of the American people &#8211; and almost certainly the vast majority of the one-third of Americans who consider themselves politically independent or moderate &#8211; &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;?  Personally, I don&#8217;t think that such attacks are going to do much to make moderate and independent voters like the Republican party.</p>

<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNN/Money) &#8211; The pace of home building slowed sharply in October as higher mortgage rates began to bite, a government report showed Thursday, in the latest sign that the housing boom may have peaked. Housing starts fell to an annual rate of 2.01 million in October from a revised 2.13 million pace in September, the Commerce Department reported, while economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a reading of 2.06 million.</p>
<p>While a pace of 2 million new housing projects a year is still strong, the reading was the second weakest of 2005.</p>
<p>Building permits, seen as a measure of how home builders view the market, sank to an annual rate of 2.07 million from 2.22 million in September, again coming in well below Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>The report comes on the heels of surveys of realtors that suggested a softening housing market and a separate survey that showed a big drop in home builders&#8217; confidence. </p></blockquote>

His post reminded me of another good paper that attempted to take a close look at how the Mexican economy has fared since joining NAFTA: Aaron Tornell, Frank Westermann, Lorenza Martinez, &#8220;<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w10289">NAFTA and Mexico&#8217;s Less-Than-Stellar Performance</a>&#8220;.  </p>
<p>The paper quite convincingly points out that lots of things have happened to Mexico&#8217;s economy over the past decade, and it is difficult to attribute Mexico&#8217;s poor economic performance to NAFTA.  From their abstract:<br />
<blockquote>Mexico, a prominent liberalizer, failed to attain stellar gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 1990s, and since 2001 its GDP and exports have stagnated. In this paper we argue that the lack of spectacular growth in Mexico&#8230; [is due to] the lack of further judicial and structural reform after 1995&#8230; The key to the Mexican puzzle lies in Mexico&#8217;s response to crisis: a deterioration in contract enforceability and an increase in nonperforming loans&#8230; The credit crunch has hit the nontradables sector especially hard and has generated bottlenecks, which have blocked growth in the tradables sector and have contributed to the recent fall in exports.</p></blockquote>
<p>In brief, they argue that the Mexican economy has suffered from some serious problems with their domestic financial institutions, not from trade.  A non-technical summary of the paper can be found <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/sep04/w10289.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>But the point I&#8217;d really like to make is not about whether trade is good or bad.  Instead, I think that what this paper (as well as the one PGL cited yesterday) best illustrates is that the link between cause and effect is often not easy or obvious.  Economies are constantly being affected by a myriad of economic forces, both external and domestic.  As such, it is dangerous to casually say that any one particular economic force must be causing any one particular economic outcome.  The world is extremely complicated, and there&#8217;s no reason to think that economic relationships are anything but extremely complicated as well.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Karl Rove sent us his chief <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-cheney-iraq,0,3658896.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">attack dog</a> tonight:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Dick Cheney added his voice on Wednesday to the chorus of Republican criticism of Democrats who have accused the Bush administration of manipulating intelligence on Iraq, calling it &#8220;one of the most dishonest and reprehensible charges ever aired in this city.&#8221;  &#8220;Some of the most irresponsible comments have, of course, come from politicians who actually voted in favor of authorizing force against Saddam Hussein,&#8221; Cheney told the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, a conservative policy group.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Cheney to suggest we Democrats are being dishonest is a bit rich – especially given the fact that <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/11/dick-cheney-who-outright-lied-to.html">Henry Waxman</a> has documented 51 times that Cheney misled the country about Iraq.</p>
<p>Hey Dick – if you wish to have a discussion as to the integrity – or lack thereof – of those of us who opposed this invasion versus yourself, we have three words for you: <strong>BRING IT ON</strong>.</p>
<p>Update: Senator Kerry responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq than Vice President Cheney. The Vice President continues to mislead America about how we got into Iraq and what must be done to complete the still unaccomplished mission.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly!  But I&#8217;d like to take address a couple of other matter starting with this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The saddest part is that our people in uniform have been subjected to these cynical and pernicious falsehoods day in and day out&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>PERNICIOUS! Wow &#8211; Cheney&#8217;s speechwriters love to do this &#8211; send him to a safe location (speech before other rightwingers) to use fancy terminology that causes us to pick up our dictionary to find out he meant &#8220;deadly&#8221;.  Of course, had he been plain spoken, some might realize that it was his falsehoods that led our soldiers in harm&#8217;s way.  </p>
<p>I loved what <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/16/cheney/index.html">Senator Hagel</a> said:<br />
<blockquote>Hagel on Tuesday defended the right to criticize the White House&#8217;s war policies in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations &#8230; &#8220;The Bush administration must understand that each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and should not be demonized for disagreeing with them,&#8221; Hagel said, according to a transcript on the council&#8217;s Web site.  &#8220;To question your government is not unpatriotic &#8212; to not question your government is unpatriotic,&#8221; said Hagel, who was decorated for his military service in Vietnam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes &#8211; during Vietnam War, we got the same garbage from the White House.  And let&#8217;s remember that Hagel and Kerry served during this war, whereas Five Deferment Dick did not.</p>
<p>President Bush is backing Cheney (surprise) and laughably claims that he does not mind criticism.  But he does mind people using their positions of authority irresponsibly.  Remind me &#8211; who was the Commander-in-Chief who used his position of authority to irresponsibly lead this nation into war for partisan purposes?</p>
