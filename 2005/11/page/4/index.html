                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/hodge200511160837.asp">Scott A. Hodge and Jonathan Williams</a> argue against a windfall profits tax using the following “logic”:<br />
<blockquote>Today, Americans pay an average of 45.9 cents in taxes per gallon of gas. The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon while the average state and local tax is 27.5 cents. These taxes pumped more than $54 billion into federal and state coffers last year alone. Diesel taxes totaled $9 billion more.  Almost all gas taxes are levied at a flat rate per gallon, regardless of whether a gallon of gas costs $1.49, $2.49, or $3.49. So while industry profits go through booms and busts, government profits grow steadily larger.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one takes a look at their graph of fuel tax in real terms – it appears that we have not seen much of an increase in real tax revenues over the past 12 years even as real GDP has increased by approximately 20%.  If one takes a look at the yellow line in the second graph of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">this post</a>, one might realize why – it turns out that we were paying around 50 cents in taxes per gallon of gas back in 1999 and now we are paying less – in real terms.</p>

                                <p>Is free trade a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504150851.asp">win-win</a> propositions with lots of benefits as <a href="http://nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow052002.asp">some</a> suggest? <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/few-notes-on-trade.html">Kash</a> and <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001754.html">Josh Bivens</a> beg to differ. </p>
<p>AB readers have to go beyond theory and discuss the evidence from NAFTA.  I shall address one piece of evidence shortly but I could not resist commenting on this from Kash:<br />
<blockquote>In fact, all economists learn about this theoretical reality, known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, in their very first course in international trade, and rehash it in every other course about trade that they ever take or teach during the course of their career.  Despite its theoretically interesting result, let me suggest that the Stopler-Samuelson theorem doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything about how harmful trade is.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Stopler-Samuelson &#8211; which is grounded in a simple two-good, two factor of production framework – cannot hope to capture all of reality, let’s think about how its prediction compares to the Ross Perot prediction that the passage of NAFTA would be immediately followed by a “giant sucking sound” of job opportunities fleeing the U.S.  First of all, Stopler-Samuelson assumes that good macroeconomic policies assure that we stay at full employment &#8211; a reasonable assumption given the good fortune that we had an economic policy team that was actually listened to by policy makers when NAFTA was implemented.  But given the fact that Mexico’s capital-labor ratio was lower than that of the U.S., standard factor price equalization logic would hold that U.S. wages would fall, while Mexican wages would rise.  Here is where Josh might object:<br />
<blockquote>Trade, on the other hand, is fully predictable in its impacts on the US: it leads to losses for the worst-positioned and benefits for the already well-off. </p></blockquote>
<p>Given the relative size of our two economies, it would seem reasonable to think that the impact of NAFTA would have been felt most strongly in the Mexican labor market.  So did all Mexican workers gain from NAFTA?  <a href="http://irpshome.ucsd.edu/faculty/gohanson">Gordon Hanson</a> has examined the evidence in <a href="http://irpshome.ucsd.edu/faculty/gohanson/mexico_wages.pdf"> What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico since NAFTA? Implications for Hemispheric Free Trade</a> (see also <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9563">NBER</a>): <br />
<blockquote>In this paper, I examine the impacts of trade and investment liberalization on the wage structure of Mexico. Part one of the paper surveys recent literature on the labor-market consequences of Mexico’s economic reforms in the 1980’s. Mexico’s policy reforms appear to have raised the demand for skill in the country, reduced rents in industries that prior to reform paid their workers high wages, and raised the premium paid to workers in states along the U.S. border. These changes have resulted in an increase in wage dispersion in the country. Part two of the paper examines changes in Mexico’s wage structure during the 1990’s. In the last decade, Mexico has experienced rising returns to skill, which mirror closely wage movements in the United States. There is, however, little evidence of wage convergence between the two countries. Regional wage differentials in Mexico have widened and appear to be explained largely by variation in regional access to foreign trade and investment and in regional opportunities for migration to the United States. I discuss implications of Mexico’s experience for the rest of Latin America in the event a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas is enacted.</p></blockquote>
<p>An increase in wage dispersion does not sound like a “win-win” to me.</p>

                                <p>This story from the front page of today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501842.html">Washington Post</a> is interesting:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Document Says Oil Chiefs Met With Cheney Task Force</strong> </p>
<p>White House document shows that executives from big oil companies met with Vice President Cheney&#8217;s energy task force in 2001 &#8212; something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by industry officials testifying before Congress.</p>
<p>The document, obtained this week by The Washington Post, shows that officials from Exxon Mobil Corp., Conoco (before its merger with Phillips), Shell Oil Co. and BP America Inc. met in the White House complex with the Cheney aides who were developing a national energy policy, parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated.</p>
<p>In a joint hearing last week of the Senate Energy and Commerce committees, the chief executives of Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips said their firms did not participate in the 2001 task force.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if today&#8217;s WaPost scoop sheds any light on the following odd detail that some people picked up on (e.g. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/11/9/121726/573">Kos</a>) during the hearings about recent oil industry profits last week: Republican Senators apparently deviated from practice and did not require the oil executives to swear to tell the truth before their Congressional testimony.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably coincidence&#8230; But it does raise some interesting questions if the two stories are connected, because it suggests the possibility that someone among the Senate Republicans suspected that the oil industry executives were going to have to lie about the Cheney task force&#8230;</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s time to check in with this week&#8217;s new data on prices.  This morning the BLS released the October data for the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">consumer price index</a>.  The data showed a small-ish increase in the overall rate of inflation in October, and a very slight rise in the core rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Yesterday the BLS provided its estimate of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">producer price index</a> for October, which showed a continued rise in energy prices for producers, but a <em>fall</em> in the prices of non-energy final goods and services that firms buy.  It&#8217;s worth noting that the prices of non-energy intermediate inputs rose at a substantial pace&#8230; but firms that supply final goods and services to other firms were apparently unable to pass those price increases along.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, these reports give us a bit of encouragement that perhaps higher energy prices will not feed through to higher non-energy prices.  At the very least, there are still no signs that happening as of yet; over the past several months, the inflation rate in non-energy items has fallen, not risen.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi_oct.jpg"></p>
<p>I&#8217;m slowly becoming reassured that the spike in inflation this year due to higher oil prices will indeed prove to be temporary, though it will take another few months of moderate core inflation data to really set my mind at ease on that score.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, this data does nothing to reassure me about my other worry: that the economy may be heading for a noticeable slowdown in the end of 2005 and early 2006.  If anything, the continued weakness in pricing power for non-energy items may provide some slight corroboration for the theory that such <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/slowing-growth.html">a slowdown may already be underway</a>.</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; Federal health officials didn’t follow normal procedures in rejecting over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill — and some documents suggest the decision was made even before scientists finished reviewing the evidence, congressional investigators reported Monday.  Politics trumped science, immediately charged long-suspicious members of Congress who had requested the independent audit. “We are deeply opposed to this subversion of science,” Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and 17 other lawmakers wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what would one expect from this White House?  After all, the President lied on Veterans Day and when the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101832.html">Washington Post</a> called him on this – the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051113.html">objected</a> with even more lies.</p>

                                <p>Tim Russert opened <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9967566">Meet the Press</a> quoting President Bush:<br />
<blockquote>It is deeply irresponsible to rewrite the history of how that war began.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then Ken Mehlman proceeded to do just that.  <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/006992.php">Josh Marshall</a> notes that Mehlman now has “twice the lying power” and <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/11/13.html#a5844">Crooks and Liars</a> provides us with the videotape. </p>
<p>It would seem that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200511110825.asp">Michael Darda</a> has joined other right wingers claiming that they opposed the 2001 tax cuts:<br />
<blockquote>As an advisor to then-candidate George W. Bush, Larry Lindsey helped design a Keynesian tax cut in 2000, which was passed in 2001 after Bush was elected. It was heavy on consumer rebates and tax credits for the married with children, and light on supply-side incentives for growth. And it was a flop. The 2002 “recovery” moved at the pace of a 40-yard dash in a geriatric ward: Real GDP averaged 1.9 percent annualized growth despite a fed funds rate that was below 2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, Lindsey was designing his “perfectly timed” tax cut back in 1999 when the economy was at full employment.  Lindsey was also selling himself as a supply-sider back then and most right wingers advocated its passage.  Yes, it flopped despite the National Review’s commentary back in 2002 that it was working wonders.  But then many Keynesians were criticizing its design given that the tax cuts were back loaded and favored high income groups.  </p>
<p>As we read on – we see Darda’s real agenda: praising the 2003 tax cuts.  I’m glad that Darda has seen the light as to the need for more national savings and investment given what he <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200511040835.asp">wrote</a> on November 4 and we <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/on-consumer-demand-and-other-nro.html">criticized</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But there is another thing I don’t get about the free lunch crowd – don’t they understand that as consumption rises relative to income, this means savings declines? Do they teach budget constraints at the economics department of National Review University or have they repealed the law of scarcity?</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Greenspan gave a speech earlier today in which he talked about the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20051114/default.htm">US current account deficit</a>.  Shorter Greenspan:
<ul>
<li>The ability of the US to keep running a huge and growing CA deficit is the result of a decrease in home bias.  In other words, investors around the world are more willing to stash their savings in other countries (e.g. the US) than they used to be, which means that US borrowers have easier access to foreign loans than they used to.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s not much that policy-makers can do about it.  Interest rate and exchange rate management would have limited effects, as would deficit-reduction efforts.</li>
<li>The US CA deficit can&#8217;t keep growing forever.  Sooner or later it&#8217;s going to stop growing, and interest rates in the US will rise.</li>
<li>However, the adjustment can probably still be smooth for the US, due to &#8220;the flexibility of our market-driven economy.&#8221;  So there&#8217;s no need to worry, unless policy-makers start mucking about with the natural workings of the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are familiar themes from earlier comments by Greenspan about the CA deficit.  I was most disappointed about this line in his speech, however: &#8220;a discretionary reduction in our federal budget deficit would work toward narrowing the current account deficit but, if history is any judge, to an uncertain and possibly small extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>This downplaying of the importance of reducing the budget deficit strikes me as almost irresponsible from a central banker.  The speech was a perfect chance for Greenspan to talk about the dangers inherent in the large and sustained structural budget deficit in the US.  While it is true that reducing the budget deficit would cause only a &#8220;possibly small&#8221; improvement in the US CA imbalance, it is also true that the effect could be possibly quite large (econometric studies disagree substantially about that point).  Regardless, any central banker of a country with the terrible budget problems of the US has a responsibility to clearly point out that budget problems and CA problems are often closely related, and that anything that can be done to alleviate the US&#8217;s CA problem will help to make the coming adjustment less painful.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the speech contained nothing striking.  Perhaps this speech contained a slightly more direct statement of the obvious, which is that the US CA deficit must start falling at some point.  But he was typically sanguine about that prospect.  Of course, like the rest of us, Greenspan has no idea when or how things will really transpire&#8230;</p>

                                <p>In The Economist, Buttonwood <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5132938">asks</a>: &#8220;The air is coming out of America’s property-price bubble. Will it pop or go quietly?&#8221;.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Mortgage applications were down by about 5% in October compared with September, and were lower than the same month a year earlier. The stock of unsold new houses is rising. The only bullish sign is that homeowners continue to take equity out of their homes at a healthy clip: in the third quarter, they withdrew more than $60 billion, on figures from Freddie Mac—about the same as the previous three-month period.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The level of mortgage equity extraction appears ominous to me, and Buttonwood agrees:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; even [if housing prices] just &#8230; rise less quickly &#8230; that would be bad news for the economy. Consumer spending accounts for 70% of growth these days, so closing down even part way the home-equity cash machine that has fed consumption would put the economic brakes on sharpish.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  But will the slowdown lead to a soft or hard landing?  Buttonwood considers the possibilities of rising financial distress:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;What could give this scenario an uglier twist is the sharp increase in funny loans to funny borrowers over the past few years. &#8216;Subprime lending&#8217; to people who would not normally be able to make the grade is running at about $500 billion a year. Much of it takes the form of variable-rate, interest-only and negative-amortisation loans. Both debtors and creditors are now more exposed to interest-rate changes.<br />&#8230;<br />So it all comes back to interest rates, and to how determined the central bank is to keep raising them until house prices retreat. &#8230; the housing market reacts to monetary tightening after a lag of one to two years, it seems, so the temptation will be to overshoot. In which case the Fedsters will bring down house prices and the economy itself not with a whimper but a bang.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I think we can put Buttonwood in the hard landing camp.  </p>
<p>And a couple of mentions:  Dr. Duy believes (FED Watch: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/11/fed_watch_heade.html">Headed for More of the Same</a>) that the FED will keep raising rates until they see clear signs of economic weakness:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;If I am reading all this correctly, the Fed will not react until it sees significant stress on the consumer (assuming that is the correct channel of transmission) – again, in the data, not anecdotally. Note that such a point could still be months away:  A housing slowdown will need to become evident, then spread into consumption, and then show up in the data.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  That sounds like Buttonwood&#8217;s possible &#8220;overshoot&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p>And a great addition to Professor Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/">Econbrowser</a>: Dr. Menzie Chinn is now a regular contributor.

                                <p>When I <a href="http://%20angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">endorsed</a> taxing some of the economic rent earned by owners of oil fields, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/market_power_su.html">David Altig</a> took notice and our <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/oil-windfall-profits-tax-and-ceteris.html">debate</a> <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/windfall_profit.html">continued</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It was certainly not my intention to associate pgl with either price controls or &#8220;the tax gouging spinmeisters,&#8221; which I probably did by combining commentary on the tax issue with commentary related to critics who accuse the oil companies of price gouging … I take pgl&#8217;s comment to be that, as long as we are searching about for ways to close the fiscal financing gap, why not take the opportunity to collect some revenue via the windfall profit tax?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you David – that is my position.  David’s main position is that the type of tax we had during the early 1980’s will not likely raise much revenue for an extended period:<br />
<blockquote>Things change, and profits and prices in the energy sector are notoriously volatile. To my mind, this fact significantly diminishes the attractiveness of a windfall profit tax as a way to finance government expenditures. </p></blockquote>
<p>In a way, he might be right as one can see viewing <a href="http://www.inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Rate/Historical_Oil_Prices_Chart.asp">this chart</a> if we decide to set the same level in real terms before the tax kicks in.  The nominal level may have been only $30 a barrel during the early 1980’s but remember that the price-level has doubled since then.  If current proposals are to impose a tax for prices above $60 a barrel, we will not collect much in revenues.  But if we set this level at $40 a barrel, I suspect the strong oil demand will continue to keep prices above this level.  </p>
<p>Some liberals might ask – why $40 and not $30 or $20.  Does David have a point with:<br />
<blockquote>A windfall profit tax is essentially an after-the-fact tax on fixed capital.  As such, it is prime candidate for the time inconsistency critique. In brief, because &#8220;windfall profits&#8221; represent returns on economic activity that has already taken place, it may seem like a free lunch to generate revenue from these profits because there is not a whole lot that the taxed companies can do to to avoid paying the tax today.  But if the impacted businesses anticipate that the tax will persist or be levied again in comparable future circumstances &#8211; and why wouldn&#8217;t they? &#8211; the end result will be a less than socially optimal level of investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>David seems to be making the same argument that this <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/stories/102505/opi_20051025001.shtml">critique</a> of the Durbin proposal makes:<br />
<blockquote>A proposal from Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., that he maintains would generate an estimated $40 billion is simply a windfall for the federal bureaucracy, not a boon for cash-strapped consumers. Durbin&#8217;s idea is just one of several floating around Washington. Under his plan, oil companies would have to pay a 50 percent tax on profits made when oil prices are above $40 a barrel … But crude oil prices aren&#8217;t driven solely by oil companies, as Durbin wants people to believe. The price of a barrel of oil is determined by a number of factors, including the familiar law of supply and demand. It&#8217;s a worldwide market. Demand is increasing from places such as China that are becoming more heavily industrialized. The supply is still heavily controlled by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The United States could have an impact by decreasing its demand &#8211; through use of more fuel-efficient vehicles, for example &#8211; and increasing its supplies. The higher oil prices could make it financially feasible for oil companies to put more revenue into exploration or into oil that is more costly to recover. A lot of small operations have resumed pumping from oil wells on farm fields in many parts of Illinois now that higher prices cover their costs. A &#8220;windfall&#8221; profits tax would do more harm than good. </p></blockquote>
<p>Have they read the Durbin proposal – especially in light of this <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w051107&#038;s=risen111005">defense</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But as Dorgan explained at a press conference announcing the bill, &#8220;this is not your father&#8217;s windfall profits tax.&#8221; Instead, the Dodd-Dorgan plan offers companies an out: Profits invested in oil exploration, refineries, or capacity expansion would be exempt from the tax. &#8220;It will be the most significant incentive for them to use those profits to invest in the ground of any incentive I can possibly think of.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Even <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/05/profits.html">Walter Williams</a> understands the point of taxing economic rent:<br />
<blockquote>Windfall or supernormal profits are any profits in excess of normal profit and are above and beyond that necessary to keep entrepreneurial resources in their current usage. However, windfall profits are a vital component to a smoothly operating economy. Windfall profits serve as a signal that there are unmet human wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Williams is against price controls, but so am I.  Furthermore, liberals like <a href="http://www.kucinich.us/archive/report/display.php?r=39&#038;d=2005-08-17+10%3A06%3A14">Dennis Kucinich</a> are also confusing the issue:<br />
<blockquote>There is a short term, effective solution: The Gas Price Spike Act of 2005. This bill exacts a 100% windfall profits tax on oil companies on excessive profits … Only a 100% windfall profits tax will cause the oil companies to stop their aggressive pricing which is destroying the budgets of millions of American families.</p></blockquote>
<p>No – I am not supporting a tax on economic rent because of some insane view that taxes lower prices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/11/windfall_profit_1.html">David Altig</a> replies by noting that some Democrats wish to tax oil companies to subsidize consumers of energy.  In the old days, we used to subsidize growers of tobacco only to tax consumers.  This exercise struck me as very odd.  David seems to think the current proposal by some Democrats to tax suppliers only to subsidize consumers is also very odd.  I agree!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Thanks to everyone for the great comments on my (albeit reluctantly offered) “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/few-notes-on-trade.html">Notes on Trade</a>” post.  I thought I should take the time to try to answer some questions and address some concerns that came up.  My response ran too long to be practically included in the comments, so I thought I’d put them up as a new post.  </p>
<p>Here is a partial list of some of the good points made by commenters, along with my reactions, in no particular order (sorry if I missed your point or question; it was hard addressing 60+ comments in a reasonable space):
<ul>
<li>Through no fault of their own, a few people were fooled by my choice of scale on the graph that I provided, which seemed to indicate that median income has been rising less quickly than the increase in US import penetration in recent years.  Since the two measures are fundamentally different (different units, different scales), that graphical suggestion was simply an artifact of the range that I selected for the graph; if I had chosen to make the left-hand axis cover the range from 5%-20% of GDP instead of 7% to 15%, it would have looked like real income has grown more quickly in recent years than import penetration.</p>
</li>
<li>A few people also noted that the graph was not convincing evidence that trade leads to higher income, because causality is unclear, perhaps trade or income are measured incorrectly, and there are lots of other things affecting both trade and income.  These points are all quite true, which is why I said that the graph proves nothing.  The graph was simply intended to illustrate that it’s certainly not obvious that more imports have reduced the welfare of the median American family.  In fact, the <em>prima facie</em> evidence probably puts the burden of proof on those who think that trade lowers median income.
<p>To really discern the relationship is a very tricky econometric problem – but one that careful economists have made some pretty good attempts at solving.  Those sophisticated econometric studies are what I was referring to when I said that the empirical evidence suggests that trade raises income. (If I have time in the next couple of days I&#8217;ll try to provide a reading list of such studies, for those masochists among you&#8230;)  My chart, however, was no attempt to provide such evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>A few people also accepted my suggestion that the benefits from trade is ultimately an empirical question, and followed up by arguing that this means that the benefits from trade should be examined on a case-by-case basis.  I would just like to note that this is extremely difficult – perhaps impossible – to do.
<p>In a narrow sense, every international transaction is of course beneficial for both sides of the deal, otherwise the parties involved wouldn’t agree to the deal in the first place.  But to determine how any particular import or export will affect the broader economy, one would need to be able to trace the effects of one individual transaction (say, one US company shifting its sourcing of T-shirts from a factory in North Carolina to a factory in Sri Lanka) on the entire economy – something that is probably impossible to do, since the US economy is so huge and each particular transaction is so tiny.  And if you&#8217;re going to do that, why not examine the economy-wide impact of <em>every</em> particular business deal, not just those that happen to cross a political border?  </p>
</li>
<li>Several people mentioned that the trade imbalance may be a significant source of worry, even if trade by itself is not a bad thing.  This is true; however, this is really a separate issue.  If the US imported less, the trade imbalance would be exactly the same as it is, because the US would also export less.  If we could magically cut our imports by $500 billion overnight, we would find that our exports also fall by $500 billion.  That’s because the trade imbalance is due to a fundamental imbalance between what Americans produce and what they consume, or, put another way, how much Americans save compared to how much people in other countries save.  Until US savings rise, the trade imbalance will remain, no matter how high or low imports are.  (Note that this is not an economic theory; this is an accounting identity, and is as true as the fact that night follows day.)
</li>
<li>There are losers from trade, and I think it&#8217;s lousy when bad things like that happen to people through no fault of their own.  As I mentioned before, many American economists (such as yours truly) are probably losers from trade, as well as some of the people commenting on the post.  Unfortunately, there are losers from just about every economic transaction that one can think of, and lots of losers from things like new technology.  But it is unclear to me why we should do things to only help the losers from trade, and ignore the losers from new inventions, or industry change, or anything else.  That doesn’t make any sense to me.  That’s why I advocate things like wage insurance, and a stronger social safety net… things that are not specific to people who lose out from trade.   Furthermore, if we try to help the losers from trade by limiting trade, then we will just create new economic losers, in industries that depended on the imports.  Why is one set of people more deserving of help than another?
</li>
<li>What’s the difference between trade and new technology?  Both increase productivity, not just in the exporting country, but in the importing country, as well, since the importing country can now produce more stuff with a smaller expenditure of resources.
<p>But some commenters referred to Bivens’ argument that technology may help low-skilled workers or high-skilled workers, but trade always hurts low-skill workers.  This may be true, though I’d need to see some evidence before I accept such an assertion.   (It’s hard for me to think of any technological changes that have helped low-skill workers in the past half-century, at least.)  But even if it is tue, that to me makes the case for providing more help to the least-skilled among us, not a case for limiting trade.  </p>
<p>In addition, Bivens notes that the prices of consumer goods have risen more quickly than the prices of all other goods, which suggests that workers have lost out from trade.  But while he’s right that there is a difference in price increases between consumer goods and all other goods, that difference is due entirely to the fact that the price of IT equipment has fallen so dramatically in price since the 1970s.  Firms buy lots more IT equipment than consumers, so it looks like prices for firms have risen more slowly than prices for individuals.  In other words, the reason for that gap is technological change, not trade. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, let me address a deeper question: if it’s not trade, what then accounts for the stagnation in incomes among the less educated in the US over the past 25 years?  Or, put another way, why has the balance of power between workers and large corporations seemed to shift?  </p>
<p>The biggest force behind this phenomenon that the best econometric studies have identified is technological change that benefits more-skilled workers at the expense of less-skilled workers (e.g. computers that replace poorly-educated workers but create new jobs for those who build, design, and run them).  Personally, I think that there’s also been an increase in corporate power because anti-trust regulation has steadily diminished over the past two decades, leaving firms subject to less competition and with more individual power. </p>
<p>If that’s true, what do we do about the plight of the lower-income, less-educated workers in the US?  My answers would be: more public resources spent on educating those at the bottom of the economic ladder; more income redistribution more generally; a stronger social safety net to help those who have the bad luck to be on the wrong side of international trade <em>or</em> technological progress – a safety net that should include wage insurance (more about that later this week) as well as national health insurance; and a new vigor from the government in promoting competition and limiting the power of individual corporations.</p>
<p>Do these things, and then I’ll be happy.  Fail to do these things, and there will continue to be people who suffer needlessly from the constant process of economic change, trade or no trade.  </p>
