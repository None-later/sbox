                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Don Luskin <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/kts200502040954.asp">nitpicks</a> himself into a corner again with another attack on Paul Krugman that also goes after Peter Orszag.  He notes that Krugman argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>when you divert some of your Social Security payroll-tax dollars into a personal account of the kind that President Bush is proposing, the government is effectively making a loan to you so that you can buy stocks on margin — “speculation that no financial adviser would recommend.”… Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution got it exactly right: “It’s not a nest egg. It’s a loan.” </p></blockquote>
<p>So Luskin fires off:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. If it’s a loan at all, it’s a loan you make to yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odd – someone just forwarded this email from David “just IOUs” Frum to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I have an IOU from you, I have an asset. If you have an IOU from you, you have an unenforceable intention. Likewise, if I own a US government bond vs. if the US government owns a US government bond. I thought John Maynard Keynes explained all this 70 years ago!</p></blockquote>
<p>I doubt Mr. Frum ever read the <em>General Theory </em>but I do think he and Luskin should compare notes.  Of course, neither would admit that this whole Social Security deform idea is to divert my retirement funds to pay for tax cuts for the rich. But then that is what Mitch Daniels was talking about with “plenty of money for a tax cut”, I guess.  </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I got another email from a reader of Angrybear that commented on Luskin’s NRO oped in the most delightful way:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s forgetting (or more likely omitting) the trillions of dollars the government needs to borrow (a loan!) to cover the transition costs. It doesn&#8217;t matter much where the actual revenue is coming from for the private accounts, because there has be equal amount borrowed to cover current benefits.  In honor of his amazing stupidity, can we call this specific topic the &#8220;Luskin Equivalency Theory&#8221;?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Barro’s Ricardian Equivalence theory should not be confused with Luskin’s.  </p>

<blockquote><p>OMAHA, Nebraska (AP) &#8211; President Bush, on a campaign-style road trip to pressure recalcitrant Democrats and reluctant Republicans on a Social Security overhaul, warned Friday against &#8220;scare tactics&#8221; in the burgeoning debate. The president decried the kind of opposition campaigns now being waged against his proposals, saying they mislead seniors into thinking they won&#8217;t get the Social Security checks on which they depend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me – but when did Bush hire Donald Luskin to write his stomp speeches?<br /></p>

<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 146,000 in January and the unemployment rate decreased to 5.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today. Job growth continued in several service-providing industries, while manufacturing employment declined over themonth.</p></blockquote>
<p>This number is barely enough to keep up with population growth, and was decidedly below expectations.  Given yesterday&#8217;s weak productivity numbers, one might have thought that more jobs was improving&#8230; but apparently not.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, this figure does suggest that the sluggish labor market is not improving, and if anything, may be slowing slightly, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>All in all, a disappointing report.</p>

<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security Trust Fund now has accumulated roughly $1.8 trillion worth of US Treasury bonds. That total debt of the United States government is, if memory serves, just over $7 trillion. US Treasury bonds are owned by Americans, foreigners, individuals, pension funds, everybody under the sun. Most of the president&#8217;s personal wealth appears to be tied up in them. They&#8217;re universally considered to be the safest investment in the world. George W. Bush is the President of the United States. So the question is to him. Are the Treasury notes in the Social Security Trust Fund backed by the full faith and credit of the United States every bit as much as the bonds everyone else owns?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is &#8220;No. They&#8217;re worthless IOUs,&#8221; then the natural follow-up would be to ask what the impact of that news will be on financial markets in general, and, in particular, the ability of the United States government to continue to finance its large deficits at reasonable prices.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>After Andrew Samwick noted an interesting query as to the Baker-Krugman logic, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/kts200502021117.asp">Luskin</a> decides he has to hurl insults at Dr. Krugman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Krugman states that the return on stocks from dividends and share repurchases is 3 percent. He states that “profits grow at the same rate as the economy,” and notes that “economic growth &#8230; averaged 3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years.”… That’s 3 percent per year in yield plus 3.4 percent in capital gains. Sounds like a 6.4 percent return, to me. Just a hair shy of the 6.5 percent Krugman and Baker asked for, but I am still going to declare victory. Even without the arithmetic, there’s nothing so unusual about thinking that stocks could return something like 6.5 percent, after inflation, over the next 75 years. After all, they’ve returned exactly that over the last 75 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before anyone starts thinking Dr. Krugman can’t add 3.0 and 3.4 properly, take a look at what he really wrote, which Luskin misrepresents:</p>
<blockquote><p>To get a 6.5 percent rate of return, you need capital gains: if dividends yield 3 percent, stock prices have to rise 3.5 percent per year after inflation. That doesn&#8217;t sound too unreasonable if you&#8217;re thinking only a few years ahead. But privatizers need that high rate of return for 75 years or more. And the economic assumptions underlying most projections for Social Security make that impossible. The Social Security projections that say the trust fund will be exhausted by 2042 assume that economic growth will slow as baby boomers leave the work force. The actuaries predict that economic growth, which averaged 3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years, will average only 1.9 percent over the next 75 years. In the long run, profits grow at the same rate as the economy. So to get that 6.5 percent rate of return, stock prices would have to keep rising faster than profits, decade after decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put, Dr. Krugman is talking about the Trustee’s projections and not the past.  Luskin gets around to sort of conceding my point later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, once again, Krugman wants it both ways. He’s sure that stocks will perform poorly in the future, but he says, “if the economy grows fast enough to generate a rate of return that makes privatization work, it will also yield a bonanza of payroll tax revenue that will keep the current system sound for generations to come.” But that’s simply not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I would hate to accuse Don Luskin of flat out lying here, so maybe he really thinks this is what Krugman said.  But then, it only proves the point – Don Luskin can’t read simple English.<br /></p>

                                <p>By the time I awake tomorrow, Kash is likely to have posted the employment report for the first month of this year.  For reasons noted below, I’m HOPING employment increases a lot this month and every month for the year.  Hoping but not forecasting.  </p>
<p>Greg Mankiw of the CEA is forecasting employment growth of only 1.5% for this year, which is likely a reasonable estimate given that most forecasters are predicting real GDP growth that is not much greater than the growth in potential output.   </p>
<p>Roger Ferguson of the Philly FED (via <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000141.html">Brad DeLong</a>) is suggesting that some of the decline in labor force participation may be voluntary. As Greg Ip and Kemba Dunham of the Wall Street Journal reported, Mr. Ferguson is giving a fair and balanced view of the state of the labor market:</p>
<blockquote><p>If indeed there is less readily available labor than previously thought, Mr. Ferguson said, &#8220;the amount of economic slack could be very small, and thus expansive monetary policy could lead to a pickup in inflationary pressures. That need not be the case, he added: &#8220;A substantial pool of unused labor may remain in the labor market, and an overly restrictive monetary policy could&#8221; slow the return to full employment. &#8220;The evidence is more ambiguous than one would like,&#8221; Mr. Ferguson said. Still, Fed officials appear to believe there remains a lot of slack in the labor market, even if it is less than they thought. The main evidence is that wage growth remains subdued.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/01/kudlow-and-atlanta-fed-on-labor-force.html">here</a>, Julie L. Hotchkiss of the Atlanta FED also noted that part of the decline in labor force participation may have been voluntary, while part of it represented the discouraged worker effect (<a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=B2793305-CF9B-64C1-13B6F8CEA41A2C22&#038;method=display">link</a> to her paper). </p>
<p>But we also noted how <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200501071537.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> misrepresented her paper.  As I think about the very good discussions from the Federal Reserve – including some of their recent optimism about short-term employment growth – the following words from Kudlow really trouble me:</p>
<blockquote><p>With this [Hotchkiss] study in mind, it is possible that this year’s unemployment rate could dip below 5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mankiw and Kudlow often emphasize the unemployment rate, I prefer to look at the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/natural-employment-population-ratio.html">employment-population ratio</a>.  And there is a big difference between what Dr. Mankiw is forecasting and what Mr. Kudlow seems to be hoping for.  Let me explain using the following table of the employment-population (EPR) ratio, the labor force participation rate (LFP), and the unemployment rate (UNR) for April 2000, December 2004, and December 2005 under three hypothetical scenarios.  </p>
<p>&#8230;..4/2000..12/2004..12/2005-a..12/2005-b..12/2005-c</p>
<p>EPR&#8230;67.4%&#8230;62.4%&#8230;.62.5%&#8230;.62.5%&#8230;&#8230;.64.0%<br />
<br />LFP&#8230;67.3%&#8230;66.0%&#8230;.66.0%&#8230;.65.8%&#8230;&#8230;.67.0%<br />
<br />UNR&#8230;3.8%&#8230;.5.4%&#8230;..5.3%&#8230;..5.0%&#8230;&#8230;..4.5%</p>
<p>12/2005-a represents my best guess as to what the CEA is forecasting.  It assumes employment as measured by the Household Survey increases from 140.156 million to 142.258 million (1.5%) and population grows by 1.3% from 224.64 million to 227.56 million.  It also assumes that LFP stays constant at 66.0%.  Kudlow’s oped seems to be suggesting the same very modest rise in employment, while he is praying for an increase in the number of discouraged workers.  Yes, we would have a 5% unemployment rate if LFP happens to fall even further to 65.8%.  But why would that be a good thing?  In fact, the average level of labor force participation over the 1989 to 2004 period (which included two recessions) exceeded 66.5%. If LFP = 66.5%, the CEA forecast for employment growth would be consistent with an unemployment rate of 6%. </p>
<p>The last column is my wish list and not a forecast.  I would hope we would have greater aggregate demand growth so that employment might rise by 3.9% rather than only 1.5%.  In this case, it would be possible to see both a rise in LFP (say to 67%) and a fall in the unemployment rate (say 4.5%).  Of course, Mr. Ferguson might reasonably ask how much excess supply currently exists.  </p>
<p>If Mr. Kudlow really believes in his measure of potential GDP used when he excused the Bush deficits in his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow112202.asp">The Deficit Dance</a>, then he should agree that my wish list for the labor market is reasonable.  OK, his suggestion that we had a $2 trillion GDP gap was just stupid math – even though this is how he claimed the recession was the only reason we had a deficit (a bogus claim based on bad math repeated by Robert Novak on Capital Gang).  But let’s take his assumptions, which seem to be: (a) the economy was exactly at full employment in mid-2000, (b) potential GDP grows by 0.85% per quarter, and (c) real GDP will grow by about 1% per quarter for 2004Q4 and throughout 2005.  This would suggest real GDP (2000$) would be $11,447 billion at the end of 2005 while potential GDP would be $11,864 million.  So Kudlow seems to be praying for continuation of excess supply and a weak labor market so that it will be a discouraged worker effect that will give the appearance of a lower unemployment rate.  Too bad – the Bush cheerleaders at the National Review are not praying for a more vigorous aggregate demand policy from this White House.  But maybe they know what Dr. Mankiw knows – this is not on the President’s agenda.<br /></p>

                                <p>Andrew Samwick <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/02/krugmans-unhappy-returns.html">summarized</a> the blog reaction to Krugman’s latest NYTimes oped the same even that the oped ran.  Andrew was kind to my musing about the Solow growth model after he offerred his insights, which I do agree with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The critical assumption in the Baker/Krugman example is that the dividend yield doesn&#8217;t rise above a number like 3 percent, forcing the capital gains to cover the other 3.5 percent and be reinvested in the corporate sector. What if the payout ratio increased dramatically, so that capital gains accounted for only the same 1.9 percent return that matched the growth rate in profits and the economy as a whole? The inconsistency goes away, as the P/E ratio is stable…But is a high payout ratio (e.g., 50% larger than what Krugman is positing) so unrealistic? I don&#8217;t believe that economists as yet have a solid answer to this question, largely because they don&#8217;t have robust models of what determines the dividend payout ratio. The most frequent answer that I have gotten when shopping this question around to better macroeconomists than I has been that the partition between capital gains and dividends is indeterminate in models used to study long-term growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain the analogy to the Glassman-Hastert (DOW 36,000) two-step, consider two simple equations. The first is V = C/(r – g) where V is firm value, C is cash flow, g is the stready state growth rate of cash flows, and r is the cost of capital.  </p>
<p>Glassman-Hastert had assumed faster growth would mean higher cash flows and firm value without considering the cost of growth, which is the second equation, C = P – g*A where P is profits and A represents tangible assets.  </p>
<p>To extend Andrew’s suggestion, let’s make two simplying assumptions.  The first is the premise that a firm might set its payout ratio so that all cash flows are remitted to shareholders with retained earnings barely covering the new investment in tangible assets necessary to finance an exogenous growth rate.  The second assumption is that P/A just happens to be equal to the cost of capital, which would imply V = A (in other words, no intangible assets).   </p>
<p>In this highly restrictive and admittedly simplified model, the payout ratio = C/P = 1 – g/r.  As an illustration, let’s assume that the cost of capital (r) is 8% and consider a fall in the growth rate from g = 4% to g = 2%.  Under the higher growth rate, the payout ratio is 50% and the dividend yield (C/V) is only 4%.  But under the lower growth rate, the payout ratio is 75% and the dividend yield rises to 6%.  </p>
<p>Of course, this inverse relationship between the exogenous growth rate and the endogenous payout ratio is based on premises of other variables being exogenous, which I admit is an incomplete modeling approach at best.  Of course, the Club for Growth crowd rarely presents a complete or coherent even though Solow’s model is now half a century old.  The key change suggested by the Social Security Trustee’s model, which the Club for Growth apparently does not get, is a reduction in the population growth rate and not a reduction in the productivity growth rate.  And the Solow model suggests capital-deepening if population growth falls relative to the savings rate.  Of course, the Club for Growth crowd celebrates the Reagan-Bush43 fiscal policies that may have reduced the savings rate claiming that these policies somehow promote more growth.</p>
<p>I’m not surprised that neither the Club for Growth or Glassman-Hastert pointed out what a very smart conservative economist noted.  But then Andrew subscribes neither to their Social Security is bankrupt claim nor to their free lunch claim.  Speaking of the latter, I still think Robert Barro got it right five years ago.  If households are rational and maximizing utility as a function of expected returns and risk, they know the Trust Fund invests their Social Security funds in government bonds so adjust their 401(K) portfolios between stocks v. bonds so as to achieve the optimal; mix of expected return and risk.  If we give them control of their Trust Fund assets, the Barro view would hold that they would place these funds into the same assets that the Trust Fund does.  So how is that going to increase portfolio return.  If one goes back half a century and read the various papers by Markowitz and Tobin, one might conclude as Barro does that there is nothing to this free lunch claim – at least the way the Club for Growth crowd puts it.<br /></p>

                                <p>Where’s the pressure to change the US’s creaking health care system?  I simply do not understand how this country&#8217;s leading politicians continue to avoid political pressure on this issue. Take a look at this selection of today&#8217;s news stories: </p>
<p>Health care is a problem for the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/02/pf/debt/health_bankruptcy.reut/index.htm">middle class</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Study: Health costs spur bankruptcy</p>
<p>Half of all U.S. bankruptcies are caused by soaring medical bills and most people sent into debt by illness are middle-class workers with health insurance, researchers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8230;The researchers got the permission of bankruptcy judges in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas to survey 931 people who filed for bankruptcy. &#8220;About half cited medical causes, which indicates that 1.9 to 2.2 million Americans (filers plus dependents) experienced medical bankruptcy,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Among those whose illnesses led to bankruptcy, out-of-pocket costs averaged $11,854 since the start of illness; 75.7 percent had insurance at the onset of illness.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/business/10795569.htm">corporate America</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Health care costs pinch profits</p>
<p>Wake-up calls usually are loud and jarring, which explains why so much attention is being paid to General Motors Corp.&#8217;s warning that soaring health care costs are hurting its bottom line.</p>
<p>&#8230;Employer-sponsored health care premiums for a family of four rose 11.2 percent to $9,950 from the spring of 2003 to the spring of 2004, the fourth consecutive year that companies and their employees have seen a double-digit increase in such costs&#8230; When announcing earlier this month a 37 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, GM cited its jump in health care costs as one of the primary reasons for the decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even the wealthy seem to be <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050201/cgtu002_1.html">worrying about it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Millionaires Worry Health Care Costs Will Affect Retirement</p>
<p>Northern Trust&#8217;s new survey of 1,312 millionaire investors, representing more than $7 billion of total investable assets, revealed that 92 percent of non-retirees are very worried or somewhat worried that rapidly rising health care costs will affect their ability to enjoy retirement. Most (88 percent) retired millionaires, 55 and older, are similarly worried, as are nearly all (96 percent) baby boomer millionaires (age 54 and under).</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read stories like these, one after another (and I&#8217;m sure there are lots more every day), I am utterly baffled as to why there is no major outcry to enact significant changes in the way this country provides health care.</p>

<br />
<blockquote>RECOMMENDED ANSWER [to the &#8220;worthless IOU/How can the government repay the trust fund&#8221; sophistry]: Easy! Almost surely, the government is going to borrow the money, as it has done for the past forty years whenever it pays back previous loans. &#8230; The government borrows from individuals and entities all over the world, and when it comes time to repay those loans, the government routinely borrows more money to conduct the transactions. The government does this every year! You may think that’s an OK idea, or you may think that the government shouldn’t borrow at all. But the government has borrowed for the past forty years, and no one uses asks how it’s going to pay the loans back until it comes time to pay back the money it has borrowed from Social Security! When the government repays Ross Perot’s bonds, for example, no one says, “Oh, we’re sorry, Mr. Perot, but the money you loaned us has already been spent”— Although, of course, it obviously has. Duh! That’s why the government borrowed it! — and no one calls Mr. Perot on the phone and tells him we’re very sorry but he has nothing in his portfolio but “a pile of worthless IOUs.” But in the case of Social Security, these ridiculous claims are suddenly offered, and this is done for an obvious reason — to mislead the public, to create the sense that some sort of crisis exists and that Social Security has gone belly-up. But that just isn’t true. Where will the government get the money? Neal, it will borrow the money, just as it has done for years, and will continue to do, whenever it pays back its loans.</p>
<p>And by the way, one important point: If the government hadn’t borrowed that money from Social Security, it would have had to borrow it from someone else. And guess what? Those debtors would have been repaid, just as the government always repays its debtors. You may not like the fact that government carries debt, but that has nothing to do with Social Security. The federal governments always pays back its debts, and it will pay back these debts in the usual manner. Stephen Moore understands all this as well as he knows his own name.</p>
<p>But Neal, one final point, and this is extremely important: Stephen [Moore, of the Club for Growth] is making these silly, scary claims for the purpose of confusing the public. Stephen understands how debts get repaid; he understands “where the money comes from.” He knows that, whenever the government repays a loan, the money has always “already been spent.” He’s raising concerns that he knows are absurd in order to frighten and mislead the public. It’s time we called a spade a spade and asked him and his associates to stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, is there some way the DNC, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi can ensure that every Democratic spokesperson who goes on air understands these points and can convey them with this much clarity?</p>

                                <p>Paul Krugman writes in his latest New York Times <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/020105.html">oped</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To get a 6.5 percent rate of return, you need capital gains: if dividends yield 3 percent, stock prices have to rise 3.5 percent per year after inflation. That doesn&#8217;t sound too unreasonable if you&#8217;re thinking only a few years ahead. But privatizers need that high rate of return for 75 years or more. And the economic assumptions underlying most projections for Social Security make that impossible. The Social Security projections that say the trust fund will be exhausted by 2042 assume that economic growth will slow as baby boomers leave the work force. The actuaries predict that economic growth, which averaged 3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years, will average only 1.9 percent over the next 75 years. In the long run, profits grow at the same rate as the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Krugman credits Dean Baker for this point – more of which I’ll turn to in a moment.  So Don Luskin <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/archives/2005/02/krugmans_long_t.php">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And in the column today, Krugman betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the economics of Social Security itself. He write, &#8220;we don&#8217;t need to worry about Social Security&#8217;s future: if the economy grows fast enough to generate a rate of return that makes privatization work, it will also yield a bonanza of payroll tax revenue that will keep the current system sound for generations to come.&#8221; Krugman has forgotten &#8212; or chosen to ignore &#8211; that under current law Social Security benefits are indexed to wage growth. If the economy grows like Krugman is talking about, yes, payroll tax revenues will grow too &#8211; but so will benefits, nearly perfectly proportionately.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a lot wrong with Luskin’s reasoning – much of which was covered by <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> in “Donald, Meet Kevin”.  But my part of departure goes to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/01/does-club-for-growth-understand-growth.html">this confusion</a> from the Club for Growth.  As I noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason the Trustees are forecasting this 1.9% real GDP growth is that they are assuming employment growth will be only 0.3% per year as they assume population growth will be about the same.</p></blockquote>
<p>(And yes that should read &#8220;they assume productivity growth will be about the same&#8221;). In other words, Luskin’s argument about differences in real wage growth assumptions has little to do with this as the Trustees are assuming productivity and real wage growth will continue at approximately the pace we have enjoyed for the past 75 years.  </p>
<p>But I do have a question for Dean Baker and Dr. Krugman, which is motivated by the Solow growth model.  If population growth declines and national savings rates stay the same, the logic has it that we will enjoy capital deepening, which would predict a fell in the return to capital consistent with Dean Baker’s financial modeling.  But the big fear over the past generation is that we have suffered a reduction in the national savings rate.  If the growth rate of employment and the national savings rate fall proportionately, doesn’t the Solow model suggest that we retain the same return to capital?  So my question to them is what is their assumption about the national savings rate and how does it fit into the modeling assuming the big change might be a fall in population growth?  I might ask Mr. Luskin and his Club for Growth colleagues, but I fear they’ll get confused and just start tossing more insults.  Wise and gentle blogger-scholars are also welcomed to tackle what I’m not quite sure about here.<br /></p>
