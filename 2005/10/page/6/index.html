                                <p>I’m saddened to see that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200510130903.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a> has taken the low road:<br />
<blockquote>Apparently, this involves publishing articles by its editorial writers that are not good enough to appear in the print edition of the paper. The first of these articles appeared on October 4 and dealt with taxation. It was written by Times editorial board member Teresa Tritch, who writes most of the paper’s economic editorials. Tritch lists her qualifications as having degrees in German and journalism, as well as years of writing about personal finance for Money magazine where she explained why people should shop around for the lowest price before buying soap and things of that sort. What really qualifies Tritch to lecture the rest of us about tax policy is her absolute conviction that our tax system is tilted too much in favor of the rich. </p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the National Review had to get Bruce to write this attack line as had it come from Luskin or Kudlow, we’d all be asking what makes them qualified to write on economics.  As far as the issue of whether the tax system being tilted to favor the rich or not, I would have hoped for a more balanced discussion from Bruce on this topic.  But alas, I should remember that had he presented a more balanced discussion, Rich Lowry would not have published it.  Then again, I prefer Paul Krugman’s op-ed over those from Ms. Tritch or the vast majority of the things published at the National Review.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/10/are_savings_ove.html">Tyler Cowen</a> poses the latest from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/09/why_savings_is.html">Michael Mandel</a> as a question to his class as well as to the rest of us:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what would be the payoff from all that thriftiness? A reasonable rate of return on investment, after depreciation, is roughly 7%. So $1.5 trillion in extra assets would have a return of about $100 billion a year. That $100 billion is roughly 1% of an $11 trillion economy. Over ten years, then, complete elimination of the trade deficit might&#8211;might&#8211;have added a tenth of a percentage point to growth. That&#8217;s a good measure of the size of the virtues of savings&#8211;roughly a tenth of a percentage point on growth. That&#8217;s 0.1 percentage points. To put that in perspective, the estimates of long-term productivity growth have risen roughly a full percentage point over the past decade. The effects of technology more than swamp the effects of savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Mandel is trying to suggest that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/tip_toe_through.html">Mark Thoma</a> and others are wrong when they advocate more savings, let me suggest that Mandel is confused.  The old (1956) Solow model of growth consider savings (and capital accumulation) and technological progress as independent determinants of growth.  More recent models of growth note that embodiment of new technology occurs with new machines &#8211; so investment and technological progress are complements.  But Mandel concedes this and poses the question &#8211; why not borrow rather than save.</p>
<p>Keynes noted that the decision to save and the decision to invest for individuals are separate decisions.  However, world investment is constrained by world savings.  We can imagine a two-country model where one nation (let&#8217;s call it the United States) invests, while the other country (let&#8217;s call it China) saves.  The fact that the first nation has to pay the second nation interest on its borrowings means the second nation gets some of the benefits from this investment.  But let&#8217;s at the facts.  China&#8217;s investment/GDP ratio is higher than our investment/GDP ratio.  In fact, our net investment is almost solely financed from borrowing.  So the facts show that U.S. is contributing very little to the world pool of savings.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/10/the_us_welshes_.html">Brad DeLong</a>, the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&#038;c=Article&#038;cid=1128723024139&#038;call_pageid=968256290204&#038;col=968350116795">Toronto Star</a> reports on Prime Minister Paul Martin’s frustration with President Bush’s trade protectionist stances:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prime Minister Paul Martin struck just the right notes with American business leaders this week, in a forceful but restrained speech arguing that Washington&#8217;s refusal to play by the rules on softwood lumber is a &#8220;breach of faith&#8221; between partners. While Martin drew bigger headlines in Canada than in the U.S., the Wall Street Journal, CNN and news agencies all carried his complaint that Washington has damaged free trade by hammering us with $5 billion in unfair tariffs.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I have also been known to complain about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/ragout-on-softwood-lumber-tariffs.html">this particular tariff</a>, one of the arguments that U.S. trade representatives make for these tariffs is that the claim that the Canadian government subsidizes the production of softwood lumber through below market stumpage fees.  While this argument might meet the legal criteria for counterveiling duties, it begs two economic questions.  One is whether it is true that the stumpage fees charged to loggers for the use of publicly owned forests in Canada are indeed below market prices.  The second economic question is whether a reduction in these fees represents a reduction in the marginal cost of producing lumber or simply a shift in who gets the economic rents from the forests.  </p>
<p>For a discussion of the rent argument, see this discussion of stumpage fees from <a href="http://www.cserge.ucl.ac.uk/Forest_Rents.pdf"> Brent Day</a>. Another interesting discussion comes from <a href="http://www.forestry/auburn.edu/zhang/Workingpaper/Harvesting%20margin%20paper%207-14-203.pdf">Changyou Sun and Daowei Zhang</a> in their “Market Structure and Timber Harvesting Margins in the U.S. South: A Temporal and Spatial Analysis”, where they begin their modeling discussion thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Timber is one of the primary factors of production in the forest industry. Players in the timber factor market consist of forest industrial firms (processors), logging firms (loggers), and forest landowners. Processors purchase timber (x) as one of their inputs and produce output (y), according to the production function y= f (x, z) where z includes other factor inputs. Processors pay the delivered price (w) for timber to loggers in the form of logging service fees (HM), and to landowners in the form of stumpage price (wf), where HM= w &#8211; wf.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/zhang/RefereedPub/CJFR1998.pdf">Clark Brinkley and Daowei Zhang</a> in “Impact of timber-fee increases on British Columbia forest products companies: an economic and policy analysis” show that a 1994 increase in stumpage fees reduced the rents received by publicly owned suppliers of lumber.  </p>
<p>The research of Dr. Zhang et al. suggests to this reader that this stumpage fee issue is really an issue of who collects the rent: Canadian taxpayers or Canadian suppliers of lumber.  As a justification for imposing tariffs, this allegedly below market stumpage fee argument does not seem to be a very good economic position.</p>

                                <p>AB read Bernie asked me to have a more balanced perspective on that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/low-savings-as-key-to-prosperity.html">Tamny op-ed</a> as in thinking in terms of debt/asset ratios.  While thanking Dryfly for a nice reply, perhaps Bernie had in mind <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200510110852.asp">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What Wessel and others can’t seem to explain is how we Americans supposedly save nothing, yet at the same time manage to get wealthier and wealthier every year. Indeed, data last month from the Federal Reserve show that U.S. household net worth hit a record of $49.8 trillion, up roughly $5 trillion in the last year alone. Notably, those gains were split almost equally between residential real estate and financial assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamny is using the same definition that Lawrence Kudlow and David Malpass have used in the past and risks running the same mistake that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/robert-samuelson-on-wealth-effect-and.html">Robert Samuelson</a> made:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I have blasted the folks over the National Review for touting the over-time increase in nominal aggregate wealth as opposed to the more modest increase in real per capita wealth …</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamny is referring to the reporting of household net worth from table B.100 of the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/data.htm">Flow of Fund Accounts</a>.  Nominal aggregate wealth rose by 14.6% from the end of 1999 to the end of 2004, but also note prices rose by 11.5% so aggregate real wealth had increased by only 2.8% over this five-year period as opposed to an increase in population of almost 5.2%.  In real per capita terms (using 2000$), net worth was over $153.5 thousand at the end of 1999 but only $150 thousand at the end of 2004.  </p>
<p>We should be delighted to note that even Donald Luskin is finally coming around to discussing issues in real per capita terms.  Unless Malpass wishes to enter the race for Brad DeLong’s stupidest man alive, he might admit that he has also learned this simple concept.  So might he and Luskin kindly teach their National Review colleagues what most college freshmen already know?</p>
<p>The next lesson at National Review University should be taught by Ricardian Equivalence advocate Victor Canto – that simply being that the Kudlow-Malpass-Tamny definition of savings omits the fact that Federal debt is rising in real per capita terms.  But one step at a time for these fellows.</p>

<blockquote>To begin, Wessel bemoans the fact that the U.S., once a creditor country, now owes the rest of the world $2.5 trillion, and talks of steps to “wean the U.S. from growing dependence on the savings of Asians and Europeans.” His characterization itself is misleading. As evidenced by the low interest rates the rest of the world charges us, it’s very clear not only that foreigners get in line to lend to us, but that they do so eagerly. Wessel however sees the 73 percent fall in the yield on the 10-year Treasury since the early 1980s as evidence of “complacency and denial among politicians and financial markets.” He also fails to point out that the path to our present debt situation has been a prosperous one, with inflation, interest rates, and unemployment all falling from double-digit rates to levels not often seen in modern times. The supposed debt explosion also coincided with a bull market that saw the Dow rise from 743 in 1982 to over 10,000 today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Tamny wants to go back a generation, let’s remind him that the Reagan fiscal stimulus raised real interest rates.  But it is true that real interest rates are low today.  The decline in real interest rates since 2000 was the result of an investment-led recession.  And while it is true that investment demand has partially recovered, entirely all of U.S. net investment is financed by borrowing from abroad as our national savings rates is near zero – whereas it was almost 10% of NNP before the Reagan and Bush43 fiscal stimuli.</p>
<p>Memo to the National Review – before you call anyone at the Wall Street Journal dumb, perhaps you might take an Econ 101 class.</p>

<blockquote>By estimating all three sources, Greenspan and Kennedy reached annual grand totals, shown on the table below. It provides the figures both in billions of dollars and as a percentage of people&#8217;s ordinary disposable (after-tax) personal income. The housing money is extra, on top of personal income.</p>
<p>YEAR | MONEY | SHARE OF DISPOSABLE PERSONAL INCOME<br />2000 | $204 bil. | 2.8%<br />2001 | 262 bil. | 3.5%<br />2002 | 398 bil. | 5.1%<br />2003 | 439 bil. | 5.4%<br />2004 | 599 bil. | 6.9%</p>
<p>Whoa! Consumers had a lot more to spend than ordinary income, almost $600 billion more in 2004. How much of that was actually spent (as opposed to being put into bank deposits, stocks or mutual funds) is unclear … The economy has depended heavily on all this extra cash. And, before the housing bonanza, there was the stock boom. From year-end 1985 to year-end 1999—just before the market peaked—the value of households&#8217; stocks and mutual funds grew from $1.4 trillion to $12.8 trillion. Economists figure that consumers spend between 2 percent and 3 percent of their extra stock-market wealth. That&#8217;s also a lot of purchasing power. No one has fully explained what caused these immense wealth gains. My own oft-stated belief is that lower inflation is the main cause, because it gradually reduced interest rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, let’s dispense with this last sentence before addressing my reservations about Samuelson’s main theme.  If nominal rates fell by the same amount that inflation fell, the Fisher effect notes no change in real interest rates and hence no wealth effect.  The point, however, is that nominal rates fell by more than the drop in inflation rates.  Now to the main event and let me put on some Ando-Modigliani life-cycle model glasses for this.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/rs2-718881.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/rs2-717003.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The wealth effect that Samuelson refers to represents a one-time addition to disposable income and not a permanent increase in it – assuming that massive capital gains won’t go on forever.  Let’s hope Samuelson realizes that one cannot count the same increase twice.  But he does suggest that the marginal propensity to spend out of newly created wealth is modest, which is consistent with the Ando-Modigliani life-cycle model.</p>
<p>What bothers me is his representation of the allegedly immense increase in wealth.  Since I have blasted the folks over the National Review for touting the over-time increase in nominal aggregate wealth as opposed to the more modest increase in real per capita wealth, I thought I’d provide a couple of simple graphs for the 1985 to 2004 period.  One graph shows consumption relative to GDP, which has grown from 64.5% in 1985 to around 70% lately.  The other graph is household net worth relative to GDP, which grew substantially from 3.5 in 1994 to 4.55 by the end of 1999.  From 1999 to 2002, this ratio fell even as housing wealth rose because of the erosion of stock market value.  </p>
<p>The rise in housing values did, however, partially offset the fall in stock wealth.  In a similar vein, the collapse of business investment, which caused a fall in real interest rates, was partially offset by increases in residential investment.  Let’s say Mr. Samuelson is correct that housing wealth is about to fall.  Note wealth stock wealth is rising so the net effect on wealth could be positive.  Hopefully, business investment and export demand will also continue to rise, which would support what James Hamilton said &#8211; <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/10/but_you_said_th.html">But you said that more saving was a good thing</a>.</p>

                                <p>The <em>Today Show</em> gave the White House another post-Katrina photo-op as George and Laura Bush hung out with Habitat for Humanity.  I guess having trashed former President Carter for a quarter of a century, it was time for a GOP leader to kiss and make up. But I tossed my breakfast when President Bush said his job was to take the politics out.  Wasn&#8217;t his first action step to blame local officials for the failures of FEMA?  Now, you will have to excuse me as I go clean the eggs and toast off the floor.</p>

                                <p>&#8230;two pioneers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a>. Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann share this year&#8217;s Nobel Prize in Economics. Descriptions of their work <a href="http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/2005/press.html">from nobelprize.org</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<h4><a href="http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/2005/index.html">               Thomas Schelling</a></h4>
<p> Against the backdrop of the nuclear arms race               in the late 1950s, Thomas Schelling&#8217;s book <i>The Strategy             of Conflict </i>set forth his vision of game theory as a unifying framework for the social sciences. Schelling showed that a party can strengthen its position by overtly worsening its own options, that the capability to retaliate can be more useful than the ability to resist an attack, and that uncertain retaliation is more credible and more efficient than certain retaliation. These insights have proven to be of great relevance for conflict resolution and efforts to avoid war. </p>
<p> Schelling&#8217;s work prompted new developments in game theory and accelerated its use and application throughout the social sciences. Notably, his analysis of strategic commitments has explained a wide range of phenomena, from the competitive strategies of firms to the delegation of political decision power. </p>
<h4><a href="http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/2005/index.html">Robert Aumann</a></h4>
<p>In many real-world situations, cooperation may be easier to sustain in a long-term relationship than in a single encounter. Analyses of short-run games are, thus, often too restrictive. Robert Aumann was the first to conduct a full-fledged formal analysis of so-called infinitely repeated games. His research identified exactly what outcomes can be upheld over time in long-run relations. </p>
<p>The theory of repeated games enhances our understanding of the prerequisites for cooperation: Why it is more difficult when there are many participants, when they interact infrequently, when interaction is likely to be broken off, when the time horizon is short or when others&#8217; actions cannot be clearly observed. Insights into these issues help explain economic conflicts such as price wars and trade wars, as well as why some communities are more successful than others in managing common-pool resources. The repeated-games approach clarifies the raison d’être of many institutions, ranging from merchant guilds and organized crime to wage negotiations and international trade agreements.</p>

                                <p>There is a basic guideline for financing a purchase; the term of the financing should match the useful life of the acquired product or service.  Of course money is fungible, so this isn&#8217;t a hard and fast rule.  </p>
<p>The logic is simple.  Any financing is paid off before the asset is retired, allowing the owner to allocate a similar portion of their income to each new purchase.  Typical examples would be a 30 year mortgage for a house, a 5 or 7 year loan for a car and paying cash for lunch.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times offers an example of mismatched financing in &#8220;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-re-loans9oct09,0,7491765.story?coll=la-home-business">Thinking Long Term</a>&#8220;.  The story describes a homeowner who consolidates her existing mortgage and home equity lines into a new 30 year fixed rate mortgage.  This may seem rational since the homeowner has a lower overall monthly payment and a predictable fixed monthly payment.  But she will be paying for her two new cars for 30 years!</p>
<p>The story offers these expenditures charged to her HELOC:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;The 48-year-old mother of two had used the money for two new cars, kitchen renovations, investment in a family business and to help her oldest daughter through law school. She quickly ran up $155,000 in debt.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The cars are probably 5 to 7 year assets, and the kitchen renovation probably has a 15 year useful life.  When she buys her next car, she will still be making payments on these two cars.  And probably the next car after that one, and maybe the one after that too!</p>
<p>Financing the investment in her daughter&#8217;s education and the family business for thrity years might be more appropriate.  Of course, she was hoping &#8220;that her home&#8217;s double-digit rate of appreciation would bail her out if she had trouble repaying the loan.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve heard that story somewhere before &#8230;</p>

                                <p>In a comment to a <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/10/financial_times.html">Mark Thoma</a> post regarding U.S. farm subsidies, Brad Setser gently reminds me not to fall for the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb107/hb107-31.pdf">Cato</a> and <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/GovernmentReform/HL644.cfm">Heritage</a> spin on the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 – also known as &#8220;Freedom to Farm&#8221;.  It seems the zeal of the Bush Administration to impose future tax burdens on our kids in order to provide current giveaways to special interests has really lowered my standards.  As <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/wopndsaer/352.htm">Won Koo and Marvin Duncan</a> note, this 1996 act “decouples government farm subsidy payments from both price and production and provides farmers with nearly complete planting flexibility”.  However, it did not end subsidies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0208d.asp">James Bovard</a> called this act “one of the clearest examples of the hypocrisy of Gingrich and many other Republican congressmen” noting:<br />
<blockquote>Conservative and free-market forces brought little intellectual artillery to the farm-bill battle. Instead, many conservatives were content to rhapsodize over the wonders of the 1996 so-called Freedom to Farm Act (the last major previous farm legislation). Such praise vivifies how few people in Washington look beyond the deceptive label congressmen attached to legislation. Back in 1996, House Speaker Newt Gingrich hyped the farm bill as a triumph of his Republican Revolution, bragging, “We passed the Freedom to Farm Act, which includes ending the [farm] subsidies after 60 years” of government handouts. In reality, the “Freedom to Farm Act” was one of the clearest examples of the hypocrisy of Gingrich and many other Republican congressmen. The 1996 farm act gave subsidized farmers more than 3 times as much in cash handouts in 1996 and 1997 as they would have received under the previous five-year farm bill. Wheat farmers got 50 times more in subsidies for their 1996 crop than they would have gotten if Congress had merely extended existing farm programs. And when crop prices went south, Congress scrambled to appropriate more billions for farmers in 1998 and every year thereafter. And with each new bucket of handouts thrown at farmers, Republicans repeated their praise of “freedom to farm.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/FTFWeb/FTFCh1.html">Enviromental Working Group</a> was even harder on “Freedom to Farm” back in 1996 – noting that much of the continued subsidies would go to the “big boys” and would squeeze “the little guy out”.  Welfare for the rich does seem to be the GOP approach to fiscal policy.  </p>
<p>In defense of the Gingrich Republicans, however, they were neither as willing to defer taxation in the same mode as the Bush Administration nor pursue the more recent forms of farm policy that Bovard notes here:<br />
<blockquote>The Republican congressional leadership never made a vigorous attempt &#8211; either in 1996 or this year &#8211; to abolish farm programs. While GOP congressional leaders proudly voted against the latest bill, they did little or nothing to attempt to frame the debate in a way that would end the waste. But responsibility for the farm bill debacle rests first and foremost with George Bush. Historically, congressmen run wild with promises of lavish subsidies and it is only the veto threats of a dutiful president that limit the fiscal damage. On farm policy, as in other domestic areas, Bush has been AWOL. When Bush signed the bill, he bragged that the farm bill was “generous” aid from “a compassionate government.” Buying votes is the only farm policy that most politicians understand. But politicians do not have the right to be generous with other people’s paychecks. While Bush and other administration officials sought to justify the various buckets of dollars in the bill, they never addressed the issue of why Uncle Sam should be in the aid business. The Bush administration — like its predecessors going back to Herbert Hoover &#8211; appears to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing about farm policy. The main effect of farm programs is to force farmers to do inefficiently what they would have done efficiently without subsidies, to force Americans to pay more for food, to drive up the price of farmland (thereby undermining American farmers’ competitiveness), and to squander pointlessly tens of billions of dollars a year. Every subsidized crop (except sugar cane) would still be grown in America even if the USDA never handed out another bushel of greenbacks. The issue is not whether the United States will have ample food in the future, but whether politicians will continue controlling American agriculture.</p></blockquote>
