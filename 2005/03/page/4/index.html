                                <p>There&#8217;s new inflation data coming out this week: the February PPI data was released this morning, and the CPI data comes out tomorrow.  I&#8217;ll put up a post with a discussion of both releases tomorrow&#8230; but if you can&#8217;t wait until then to peruse the PPI data here&#8217;s the text of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">PPI News Release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 0.4 percent in February, seasonally adjusted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  This increase followed a 0.3-percent gain in January and a 0.3-percent decline in December.  At the earlier stages of processing, the intermediate goods index advanced 0.7 percent, after moving up 0.4 percent in the previous month, and prices for crude goods fell 1.6 percent, following a 2.0-percent decrease in January.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Let’s use oil markets to say welcome to two new blogs from very different Republicans.  Alas, the first is from <a href="http://lkmp.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-oil-overpriced.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who removed one of his posts but NRO still has <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow.asp">this version</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>$55 Oil Won’t Last…Ultimately, the answer to high oil prices is a lot more production. That’s exactly what the Bush administration intends to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Lawrence was shilling for Bush’s ANWR policy.  Two pieces of good news.  John Kerry was firing up his base to garner support in opposition to the ANWR legislation.  And the other piece of goods news is that we can know enjoy the blog from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/03/china-and-price-of-gas.html">Calculated Risk</a> (OK, CR has already introduced himself as our new and very able colleague).  While Kudlow focuses on U.S. production, CR focuses on the world market for oil and has a nice time series of production and consumption of oil by China.  </p>
<p>Alas as Mr. Kudlow (who once said the Iraq War would lower oil prices to $12 per barrel) had predicted it would not go above $55, other bloggers including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/higher-and-higher.html">Kash</a> and <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/03/on_oil_just_whe.html">David Altig</a> were giving more sober readings of the current oil market.  </p>
<p>My contribution to this discussion draws from the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/results.html">Energy Information Agency</a> and its <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2005 with Projections to 2025</em>.  Their model forecasts the positions of the U.S. demand and supply curves for the period from 2005 to 2025 and essentially treats the U.S. as a price-taker.  Since the Energy Information Agency realizes it is hard to predict what OPEC will do as suppliers and what world demand will look like in 2025, they provide different forecasts using world prices as low as $21 a barrel to as high as $48 a barrel (all in 2003$).  The following chart shows that if prices stay high, we are projected to consume 3.6 times as much as we produce.  Now, maybe prices will plummet as Kudlow suggests but the effect of lower prices is to reduce U.S. production and to increase our consumption so we will consume 4.3 times as much as we produce with higher imports making up the difference.  </p>
<p>These forecasts do not say reducing our excess demand for oil is not a good idea.  Anything that would increase domestic production or reduce our consumption would tend to reduce our imports – and might even have some impact on reducing world prices.  But proponents of the ANWR legislation exaggerate the benefits of it and understand its costs.  Besides – when one’s economic modeling approach begins with what would Karl have me say, it is likely not to be a very reliable means for forecasting.  </p>

                                <p>In some dimensions, transatlantic diplomatic relations have been improving over the past few months.  Yet in others they are clearly not.  Bush&#8217;s nomination of  Wolfowitz last week to head the World Bank prompted a rather cool response from Europe &#8212; in fact, EU finance ministers will <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21593082.htm">discuss the nomination</a> at their summit in Luxembourg this week.  And to potentially complicate matters, it now seems that the US and EU will be filing yet another set of suits against each other with the WTO:<br />
<blockquote>LONDON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BAD244403-98DD-4DF9-B356-77A9299667CB%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8211; Tensions between the United States and the European Union over subsidies for rival aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus escalated over the weekend as both sides resumed threats to launch a legal battle at the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the US decides to move to the WTO approach, which we hope they will not, obviously we would launch our own counter case,&#8221; said a European Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity, AFX News reported.</p>
<p>Talks between the U.S. and the EU to resolve the dispute hit an impasse Friday, according to the U.S. trade representative&#8217;s office. </p></blockquote>
<p>Trade disputes between the US and EU have simmered for years, generally without spilling over into other areas of policy.  But this time, I wonder; the big players in the EU don&#8217;t seem to be quite ready to block the nomination outright right now&#8230; but some in the EU might be quite happy to use the WTO suit as a good way to push the EU a bit closer to doing so.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>At least the Bush Administration is consistent; talk prudence, deliver squander.  The new budget is no exception.   </p>
<p>The NY Times projects $125 billion in additional deficit spending over the next 5 years, and $1 Trillion over the next ten years.  I suggest reading the NY Times Editorial, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/opinion/20sun1.html">Washington&#8217;s Fiscal Meltdown</a>&#8220;, but here is the short version: <strong>More tax cuts for the wealthy and ever larger budget deficits</strong>.  Of course there are a few spending cuts, mostly on programs for the poor, and no action on the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a tax that more and more middle class Americans will be paying.  </p>
<p>The only honest comment I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/18/politics/18budget.html">read</a> (via <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Economist’s View</a>) was from Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) who said after one particular vote: “We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing.&#8221;  I wholeheartedly agree.  </p>
<p>And while I’m writing about deficits, take a look at this number:<br />
<blockquote><strong>$661,568,870,319.77. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>  That is $661+ Billion and represents the increase in the National Debt over the last 12 months (March 17, 2004 to March 17, 2005).  <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opd.htm">Source: U.S. Treasury</a>  Some readers may be thinking “I thought the deficit was around $400 Billion.”   Here is an explanation: There are at least three methods of presenting the deficit; the first is the “Unified Budget” that includes the annual surplus from Social Security Insurance (and the miniscule Postal Service Fund) in the total.  The second is the “General Fund Budget” (the most used) that excludes the SS Insurance surplus, but includes surpluses from Military Retirement, Federal Employee Retirement and many other smaller trust funds.  The third approach (my favorite) is to use the annual increase in the National Debt as the annual deficit.  The third approach suffers from timing issues and assumes the Federal Government is on a cash basis.</p>
<p>The following graph shows these budget methods since ’92:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/deficit3methods.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/deficit3methods.jpg"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>The problem with the “Unified Budget” is that it uses the Social Security surplus to mask the extent of the deficit.  The General Fund has a similar problem, but the included trust funds (like military retirement) are much smaller.  Politicians, using the Unified Budget, are tacitly suggesting an income transfer from low and middle income Americans to the wealthiest Americans.  Not exactly sound public policy.</p>
<p>So how do we fix the problem?  On March 2nd, in testimony before Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/2005/20050302/default.htm">Greenspan said</a>: &#8220;&#8230; tax increases &#8230; arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base.&#8221; Further, Greenspan said &#8220;&#8230; if at all possible &#8230; close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly, from the outlay side.&#8221; Mr. Greenspan is wrong on both counts.  The following graph illustrates the causes of the budget deficit:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/incomeoutlay.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/incomeoutlay.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The chart depicts Federal Government income and outlays as a % of GDP.  &#8220;Income&#8221; does not include the surpluses for the various trust funds.  The graph shows that a steady combination of spending restraint and tax increases brought the budget into balance at the end of the ‘90s.   </p>
<p>Although spending has increased in recent years, the main culprit for the large deficits is the drop in tax revenue, as a % of GDP, due to the Bush tax cuts.  Obviously Mr. Greenspan’s comment that tax increases “pose significant risks to economic growth” ignores the history of the ‘90s.  How do we fix the problem?  Reverse most or all of the Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>I believe the huge and growing Federal budget deficit is the highest priority fiscal challenge facing America.  The projected budget deficit, over just the next ten years, dwarfs the 75 year actuarial shortfall of Social Security.  And yet there is no leadership, from either the White House or the Hill, on the budget issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush only pays lip service to the deficit, instead focusing on his proposals for Social Security.  In my view, Mr. Bush is suggesting we paint the front porch; meanwhile the house is burning down.</p>

He&#8217;s also &#8220;pro-choice, pro-science (pro-evolution), adamant about separation of church and state and &#8230; opposed the Iraq invasion.&#8221; (Perhaps at some point, C.R. will explain how he managed to stay Republican after, say, 1972, with those views.) And he even worked for his local Kerry campaign last year.

<blockquote><p>Mark Kleiman has a <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/03/schiavo_hudson_and_nikolouzos.php">must-read post</a> on the appalling hypocrisy revealed by the conservative movement&#8217;s reaction to <i>l&#8217;affaire Schiavo</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3084934">Sun Hudson, a six-month-old boy with a fatal congenital disease, died Thursday after a Texas hospital, over his mother&#8217;s objections, withdrew his feeding tube.</a> The child was apparently certain to die, but was conscious. The hospital simply decided that it had better things to do than keeping the child alive, and the Texas courts upheld that decision after the penniless mother failed, during the 10-day window provided for by Texas law, to find another institution willing to take the child .
<p>Where, I would ask, is the outrage?  In particular, where is the outrage from those like <a href="http://majorityleader.gov/news.asp?FormMode=Detail&#038;ID=409">Tom DeLay, who referred to the withdrawal of Terry Schiavo&#8217;s life support as &#8220;murder&#8221;</a>? If it&#8217;s appropriate to Federalize the Schiavo case, what about the people being terminated simply because their cases are hopeless and their bank accounts empty?</p>
<p>Sun Hudson is dead, but <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7201470/">68-year-old Spiro Nikolouzos is still alive</a>, thanks to an emergency appeals court order issued yesterday. However, his life support could be cut off at any moment. A nursing home is willing to take him <i>if</i> his family can show that he will be covered by Medicaid after his Medicare runs out. Otherwise, the hospital gets to pull the plug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It seems worth noting at this point that the overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus voted last week to cut Medicaid benefits. Like the cowards that they are, no specific cuts were on the table, rather they wanted to force Governors to undertake unspecified cuts. We do know, however, what Medicaid spends the bulk of its money on &#8212; long-term care for ailing elderly and disabled people &#8212; so we know what would have been cut. Nor do the handful of Republicans whose defections blocked the cuts in the Senate deserve one iota of credit. They, too, voted for the steep tax cuts that will make Medicaid cuts necessary. And of course the sort of situations under discussion here are the direct result of a law that <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_03_13_atrios_archive.html#111128106206105854">George W. Bush himself signed</a>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>       <nitf>Republicans acknowledged that the intervention was a departure from their usual support for states&#8217; rights. But they said their views about the sanctity life trumped their views about federalism.</nitf></p>
<p>       <nitf>An unsigned one-page memo, distributed to Republican senators, said the debate over Schiavo would appeal to the party&#8217;s base, or core, supporters. The memo singled out Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is up for reelection next year and is potentially vulnerable in a state President Bush won last year. </nitf></p>
<p>       <nitf>&#8220;This is an important moral issue and the pro-life base will be excited that the Senate is debating this important issue,&#8221; said the memo, which was reported by ABC News and later given to The Washington Post. &#8220;This is a great political issue, because Senator Nelson of Florida has already refused to become a cosponsor and this is a tough issue for Democrats.&#8221;</nitf></p>

                                <p>Republican strategists call for this <a href="http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/031705/reform.html">change in tactics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To pass Social Security reform this year, top Republican strategists say, President Bush and the GOP-led Congress must redirect the debate by stressing that their plan includes a crucial safety-net protection…That guarantee, which is included in certain Social Security reform bills, could be used as an effective rebuttal to comparisons that liken private accounts to playing the slots, GOP officials say. “It would take away one of the [Democratic] arguments,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), while former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said a guarantee “would reassure seniors and the nearly retired.” Stephen Moore, president of the Free Enterprise Fund, said the safety net would ensure that “Grandma and Grandpa don’t get thrown out of their home” if their investments go sour.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stephen should call Andrew Biggs of the Cato Institute.  The new GOP idea is actually an old one that Biggs suggested would lead to something akin to the S&#038;L crisis.  The proposal would insulate day traders from the downside of risk so they can only benefit from the upside of market swings.  There are two problems with this idea.  The Social Security Trust Fund will bear any such downside losses, which would make it less solvent.  The point raised by Mr. Biggs is that households will have an incentive to undertaken additional risk since the household would gain if the market performed better than expectations, while the Trust Fund would lose if the market performed poorly.  This “heads I win, tails you lose” system would suffer from the moral hazard problem of households taking substantial risk.  If the GOP really wants to destroy Social Security, this strategy would do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_hassett/hassett200503180819.asp">Kevin Hassert and Maya MacGuineas</a> tell us not to fret over silly words like “carve-out” and then write this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently 11 percent of covered wages are devoted to paying benefits. This is projected to climb to over 19 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lest we miss the importance of this 11% to 19% claim, what Hassert and MacGuineas are trying to slip by us is that the pay-as-you-go claim, which really means all those Trust Fund reserves we are building up and all that interest income does not belong to our retirement after all.  Yes, those wishes to steal from the lock box don’t want us to get hung up on the details.</p>

                                <p>Oil prices keep hitting new record highs.  Yesterday saw the price of oil hit $57/bbl for the first time, before it fell slightly by the end of the day.  Probably of more significance is the fact that market sentiment is apparently solidfying around the idea that such high oil prices are here to stay, and in fact that they will trend still higher if anything:<br />
<blockquote>DALLAS (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?column=Futures+Movers&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; A new forecast for world oil demand, coupled with concerns about U.S. gasoline and distillate supplies, drove gasoline to a record closing Thursday, while crude gave back gains after a 4 percent run-up in the previous three sessions.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the forward months for crude and gasoline closed even higher, an ominous sign ahead of the summer driving season. Mike Fitzpatrick, an energy analyst at Fimat, called it a classic case of contango, which is when the front month trades at a discount to the later delivery dates.</p>
<p>Crude for April delivery settled at $56.40, down 6 cents, after trading at a record $57.60 a barrel. May crude closed at $56.91, June crude closed at $57.42, and July crude finished at $57.64.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;There&#8217;s rampant speculation that there&#8217;s plenty of supply in the front, but that in the third and fourth quarters, supply won&#8217;t be able to meet demand,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said, adding that prices at these levels could serve to temper demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prices are these levels certainly will have effects on demand.  After all, even in inflation-adjusted terms we are now nearing oil prices that were last seen during the major oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. </p>
<p>The following chart shows the price of oil since 1970 expressed in today&#8217;s (Jan. 2005&#8217;s) dollars.  The chart shows two series: the orange line shows the real price of oil adjusted for consumer price inflation (for all items <em>other</em> than energy), while the blue line shows the real price of oil after adjusting for producer price inflation (also for all items other than energy).  The orange line is therefore the relevant line if you want to know how expensive oil is from the consumer&#8217;s point of view, relative to all other items that consumers buy; the blue line is the relevant line if you want to know how expensive oil has become from the point of view of firms, relative to their other costs.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/real_oil_prices2.jpg"></p>
<p>From the consumer&#8217;s point of view, oil is now more expensive than it was in the wake of the first oil shock.  From the point of view of businesses, oil is now more expensive than at any time except for the period immediately after the second oil shock, 1980-82.  Another $10 rise in the price of oil and it will be near its all-time highs in real terms.</p>
<p>Given these very high real prices for oil, I think that it is certain that these prices will have noticeable effects on economic activity &#8212; and thus the demand for oil &#8212; in 2005.  It will probably also have noticeable effects on inflation.</p>
<p>Markets have seemed uncertain lately; some analysts have talked of being at or near an economic tipping point, a moment where things will soon appear substantially better or substantially worse.  The continued rise in the price of oil would seem to make the latter outcome more likely.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3773191">The Economist</a> makes some excellent points about Bush&#8217;s economic team this week.  1) It is very weak, as everyone knows.  2) This may not be a major problem under normal circumstances.  3) This will almost certainly be a <strong>very</strong> major problem if something goes wrong.<br />
<blockquote><strong>George Bush&#8217;s economic team still looks weak</strong></p>
<p>There are two growing suspicions about Mr Bush&#8217;s approach to economic policy. The first is that he sees it mainly as a question of salesmanship. Showing an admirable faith in markets, the president seems to think that economic policy will basically run itself; what you need is a bit of pizzazz to sell the president&#8217;s reforms. Hence, the White House&#8217;s enthusiasm for Carlos Gutierrez, the new commerce secretary, who made his fortune selling breakfast cereal at Kellogg.</p>
<p>The second suspicion is that loyalty is more important than knowledge. That was Mr O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s problem: he said that more tax cuts were a bad idea. Larry Lindsey, Mr Bush&#8217;s bumptious first chairman of the National Economic Council, was pushed out soon after he made the impolitic (but pretty accurate) point that the Iraq war could cost $200 billion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, markets never work quite that sweetly. What would Mr Bush&#8217;s team do if there was some sort of international economic crisis, such as a dollar crash? The main international person at the Treasury, John Taylor, has failed to make much of a mark. His replacement is likely to be Tim Adams, head of policy for the Bush-Cheney campaign and before that Mr Snow&#8217;s chief-of-staff. In the White House, there are even fewer people who understand international economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>If and when an international financial crisis happens, the Bush administration will have no one to provide effective leadership, no authority that financial markets will trust and respect, and no one with experience to provide good policy advice.  </p>
<p>In 2004 Paul Volker asserted that he thought there was a 75 percent chance of such a crisis happening within five years.  Maybe it&#8217;s time that someone started thinking about what to do in such an eventuality, because chances are good that the Bush administration&#8217;s response will be confused, inept, or altogether non-existent.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It would seem that William Buckley has decided to show the kids over at NRO how to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200503021122.asp">an oped</a> on economics as he blasts Lou Dobbs for being a trade protectionist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The indignation of Mr. Dobbs caused some viewers to wonder whether there was, suddenly, a development in the economic picture that altered the common understanding of the case for free trade. Roderick Boyd in the New York Sun reports: “One intellectual opponent of Mr. Dobbs’s said he focuses on the costs of America’s free-market policies without even trying to communicate the benefits…What is new is the immaterialization of many economic products. There isn’t any way to send a banana through cyberspace, but that doesn’t really affect the basic reason for free trade, which is the doctrine of comparative advantage. Even though there is a universalization of skills, in an age when anybody can type on a keyboard, the acquisition of such skills by a Third World country does not diminish the value of goods being produced, rather it adds to it. The worker in Central America can hope to buy the radio made in Japan, or the computer made in California. The proposition hasn’t changed, that the difference between greed and husbandry has to do with the perspective of the critic. When a century ago we were shown the horseless carriage, we didn’t think to focus on the greed of Henry Ford; we chose, rather, to applaud his ingenuity. President Bush is standing by free trade policies (however imperfectly we abide by them). It requires acts of faith in economic laws to applaud free trade. But Adam Smith was resoundingly correct in laying down the law that both parties benefit, giving us the benefit of exposure to Lou Dobbs, and the freedom to reject his counsel.</p></blockquote>
<p>But in partial defense of Lou, his show <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/01/ldt.01.html">a couple of Tuesdays ago</a> had a very good discussion about CAFTA with Christopher Padilla:</p>
<blockquote><p>PADILLA: Well, these are small countries, Lou, but they&#8217;re actually very big markets for our exports. In fact, we trade more with Central America than we trade with Brazil or with Australia. As the president says, you know, it&#8217;s easy to trade into America. What we want to do is make sure that others open their markets so that we can sell them our products and services. I watched your program last night. You had a farmer on from Iowa, who&#8217;s concerned about CAFTA. And I wonder what that farmer would say if he knew that 99 percent of farm products coming in from Central America today are duty-free, but if he grows corn or soybeans or hogs or cattle, he has to pay pretty hefty tariffs on those things in Central America. So we probably won&#8217;t agree on a lot of trade agreements, Lou, but on this one, I think we are leveling the playing field, and I think that&#8217;s a strong argument for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later Lou fired off this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, you once referred to this broadcast, particularly me, implying that I&#8217;m something of a protectionist, and I just want to set the record straight, between you and me, just you and me, no one else, I&#8217;m neither a protectionist or an economic isolationist as the administration has tried to brand me. I want to see healthy, mutual, balanced trade. I have to ask you, in that sense, what is this administration? Because if I for the life of me cannot understand why we continue to pursue policies that for 20 years have resulted in deficits, and we&#8217;re a country now approaching $4 trillion in external trade debt. When are we going to redress what is a clear deficit and a clear and I think present danger to the well-being of this economy?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey Lou, I’m not going to defend Bush’s economic record, but let’s be clear, the trade deficit is the result of policies that have lowered national savings.  I know Buckley may have been rough on you so perhaps you’d prefer to read columns from the kindler and gentler <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett091703.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a>. Note to NRO: more Bartlett and Buckley, less Kudlow-Luskin-Moore.</p>
