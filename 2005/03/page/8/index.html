                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Many thanks to Kash for posting the good news on the payroll employment increase as well as very good commentary on the household survey numbers, such as the modest rise in the civilian labor force, as well as the fact that the employment-population ratio fell from 62.4% to 62.3%.  </p>
<p>All that is left to add is my UTTER FRUSTRATION with a couple of CNN and NPR reporters who claimed that the rise in the unemployment rate was due to a strong increase in the civilian labor force.  Odd, BLS is reporting that the participation rate held at 65.8 percent.  Simply put, the increase in the civilian labor force barely kept pace with the increase in civilian adult population.  </p>
<p>What did cause the rise in the officially reported unemployment rate was the 97,000 reduction in the household survey measure of employment.  Now there are two ways to read the difference in the two surveys.  By Lawrence Kudlow logic, self-employment fell by 360 thousand.  I guess Lawrence must think that all of those 262 thousand new payroll jobs were from people leaving self-employment for a better paying position with a company.  But of course, Lawrence’s logic is bogus with my preferred explanation being the usual noise in the series that Sec. Snow prefers to report but only during months when the household survey increase exceeds the payroll survey increase.  </p>
<p>Maybe next month, payroll employment might rise another 250 thousand and the household survey could report a 600 thousand increase.  After all, Sec. Snow needs to crow about something now that he is in the dog house for agreeing with Bill Clinton on Soc. Sec. add-on accounts.  Which reminds me of another NPR reporter who said the Democrats have no new ideas but then called Snow’s suggestion that he took from Clinton a new idea.  Maybe NPR thinks President Clinton was a Republican.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001197.html">Max Sawicky</a> knows how to read a jobs report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate is up, from 5.2 to 5.4 percent, because the household survey shows jobs down, labor force participation up.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for a real laugh at a reading snafu by yours truly, check out the comments section.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200503041510.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> &#8211; aka the household survey measure is the more reliable &#8211; writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friday’s payroll-jobs increase of 262,000 is yet another data-point arguing that the economy may actually be speeding up in the first half of 2005. Using a 12-month moving average of monthly job changes, nonfarm payrolls have increased to 200,000 through February 2005 from a decline of 150,000 going all the way back to January 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of the fall in the household survey measure of employment.  Wonder if Larry writes the script for Treas. Sec. Snow?</p>

                                <p>The BLS&#8217;s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">employment report</a> came out this morning, and it showed a strong gain in employment for the first time in several months:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 262,000 in February and the unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job growth occurred in both goods-producing and service-providing industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a good number, and a hopeful sign of coming improvement in the labor market.  But we need a few more months like this before we can really conclude that the labor market is improving.  Before this report, 6 of the last 8 months showed job gains that barely kept up with the growth of population in the US (estimated to be about 140-150 thousand new workers per month).  As a result, the employment-population ratio &#8212; the percent of people over 16 who actualy have jobs &#8211;has not yet begun to rise from the very low levels of the past few years, as the following chart shows.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empopratio.jpg"></p>
<p>A few more good jobs reports like this will help push this ratio higher&#8230; though of course one shouldn&#8217;t count on anything in this labor market.</p>

<blockquote><p>Four years ago, Alan Greenspan urged Congress to cut taxes, asserting that the federal government was in imminent danger of paying off too much debt. On Wednesday the Fed chairman warned Congress of the opposite fiscal danger: he asserted that there would be large budget deficits for the foreseeable future, leading to an unsustainable rise in federal debt. But he counseled against reversing the tax cuts, calling instead for cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Does anyone still take Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s pose as a nonpartisan font of wisdom seriously?</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The free-lunch supply-side crowd is crowing over how certain Eastern European nations, including Slovakia, have been growing rapidly allegedly as a result of a move to a flat tax.  Witness the comments from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050224.html">President Bush</a>:  <br />
<blockquote>Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I&#8217;m thrilled to be here. I have really been looking forward to this trip to Slovakia. We just had a great discussion. First, I complimented the Prime Minister on putting policies in place that have helped this economy grow. The most important responsibility we have at home is to make sure our people can find work. And the President put a flat tax in place; he simplified his tax code, which has helped to attract capital and create economic vitality and growth. I really congratulate you and your government for making wise decisions. Slovakia is a great example of what can happen when people are set free. And this is an exciting place to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Making sure people can find work?  Does the President realize that the <a href="http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwkey=u900&#038;rwdspl">unemployment rate</a> was 14.3% in 2004?  Hopefully it will fall below 13% and is true that recent real GDP growth has been strong.  But Slovakia moved to a flat tax only last year, while real GDP growth had been strong even before 2004.  Alas, this source only goes back to 2000, but <a href="http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu/indicator_detail.cfm?IndicatorID=19&#038;Country=SK">this interactive source</a> charts GDP per capita for various nations standardized in terms of PPP-dollar.  (While this measure includes not only real GDP increases but also the U.S. rate of inflation, our inflation rate has been modest over the 1985 to 2002 period displayed.)  </p>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm">useful source</a> does mention the move to the 19% tax rate as of 2004 as well as the circa 5% expected growth rate for the year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has continued the difficult transformation from a centrally planned economy to a modern market-oriented economy. This reform slowed in the 1994-98 period due to the crony capitalism and irresponsible fiscal policies of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar&#8217;s government. While economic growth and other fundamentals improved steadily during Meciar&#8217;s term, public and private debt and trade deficits soared. Privatization, often tarnished by corrupt insider deals, progressed only in fits and starts. Real annual GDP growth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999. Much of the growth in the Meciar era, however, was attributable to high government spending and over-borrowing rather than productive economic activity.  The economy grew 4.2% in 2003, the strongest growth in Central Europe, and is predicted to expand by more than 5% in 2004. </p></blockquote>
<p>Note how this discussion attributed growth during the Meciar era to high government spending and also noted the problems created by crony capitalism and irresponsible fiscal policies.  One would suspect that the strong growth in the years just before the 2004 change in tax policies might be attributed to less crony capitalism and more responsible fiscal policies.  </p>
<p>The rightwing loves to cherry pick years where nations have had temporarily high growth rates and then attribute these to some made-up story as to their favorite tax policy.  Using the logic of <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200502280004">John Fund</a>, for example, a lot of nations have flat tax systems.  We should all celebrate the fact that Slovakia’s very modest income per capita levels are rising, but all one can honestly say is that a flat tax is simple as does <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/nrof_bartlett.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a>.  OK – Bruce called a flat tax “fair”, which may be true in the limited sense of horizontal equity as long as we ignore the Steve Forbes exception for capital income.</p>

                                <p>Would privatizing Social Security have any effects on national security?  While Robert Barro has used his Ricardian Equivalence logic to say no, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000468.html">Brad DeLong</a> objects when Greg Mankiw also claims there is no effect.  Brad explains why he disagrees with Mankiw’s WSJ oped and documents why even Dr. Mankiw might disagree with Barro’s proposition.  After all, the first edition of Mankiw’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0716752379/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-9183775-9149765#reader-page">Macroeconomics</a> (OK, maybe I should purchase this fifth edition) suggested that the Reagan tax cuts did lower national savings.  </p>
<p>But let’s understand what Barro has said over time with respect to Ricardian Equivalence as well as privatization of Social Security.  While Barro as a libertarian is for privatization, he has consistently argued that privatization does not yield a free lunch.  And during the debate over tax cuts during Bush’s first term, economists who accepted Mankiw’s view of consumption over Ricardian Equivalence were arguing it would raise consumption – which means it would lower national savings as long as government purchases were not cut.  So how did some of the Bush cheerleaders claim permanent tax cuts would not raise interest rates?  By an appeal to Ricardian Equivalence that contradicts their claim that the tax cuts would raise consumption.</p>
<p>But is there anything to this notion that Bush’s Social Security ideas might actually raise national savings?  I think the old Neil Wallace-Thomas Sargent “game of chicken” concept may offer some clues. In some of Sargent’s writings, he suggested that the Reagan tax cut forces were hoping to make the tax cuts permanent by coercing the appropriators in Congress to slash spending.  Of course, this never worked but perhaps the belief that it might work is one possible explanation of why consumption jumped in the 1980’s that is consistent with Barro-Ricardian logic.  Fast-forward to the 2005 debate over Social Security and think about the 2018-just IOUs yahoos.  They are hoping that Bush’s tax cuts for the rich can be made permanent by raiding the lockbox.  Bush, on the other hand, is too chicken (or too dishonest) to tell workers the implications of what his 2018-just IOUs supporters are suggesting.  So the free-lunch promises go on – and we spent expected future income that cannot be there for everyone.  If we could just end this charade and tell the public the truth, maybe national savings would rise.  But then Mankiw’s former boss and his supporters are the ones who are spreading this charade.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I missed <a href="http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/business/11031391.htm">this part</a> of Greenspan’s testimony on first read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Diverting the payroll taxes into the Social Security trust fund, he said, had merely allowed the government to run larger budget deficits. Greenspan said that switching to the private accounts would be a way to bolster the nation&#8217;s low savings rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot believe Greenspan said this.  After all, he supported Bush’s tax cuts, which is why the deficit rose and the savings rate fell.  I guess having a trust fund to raid allowed Greenspan to play the three card monte game with ease.</p>

                                <p>Greenspan first calls for cutting Social Security benefits, which would mean part of that 12.4% payroll contribution would become a pure and simple backdoor employment tax increase.  Now Greenspan calls for lower taxes on capital income as he endorses a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/03/news/economy/greenspan_tax.reut/index.htm?cnn=yes">consumption tax</a>.  Is Dr. Greenspan trying to claim incentive effects on apply to taxes on capital income and not on labor income?</p>

                                <p>The BLS has revised its estimates of <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm">fourth quarter productivity growth</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor today reported revised fourth-quarter seasonally-adjusted annual rates of productivity change&#8211;as measured by output per hour of all persons&#8211;and revised annual changes for the full year 2004.       </p>
<p>     In the fourth quarter, productivity increased 3.7 percent in the business sector, more than the 2.5 percent preliminary estimate published Feb. 3.  In nonfarm businesses, productivity grew 2.1 percent, compared to the preliminary estimate of 0.8 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rates). On an annual average basis, productivity rose 4.0 percent in both sectors &#8212; the same as the preliminary estimate for the business sector, and 0.1 percentage point lower than previously reported for nonfarm businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>2004 marks another year in which worker productivity grew rapidly while worker compensation did not.  The following chart shows the growing gap between productivity gains and compensation gains over the past decade.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/workers1.jpg"></p>
<p>Worker compensation and productivity typically move very closely together, but in recent years this link has weakened.  Many people argue that the reason for this is international labor competition.  But I&#8217;m not convinced by that argument; the growth of import competition was much more rapid during the 1990s than it has been over the past few years, and yet during the 1990s labor compensation kept up with productivity growth.  I have a feeling that the answer has more to do with reduced domestic competition, and possibly a business-friendly regulatory and legal environment.  Regardless, its an important phenomenon that needs to be addressed.</p>

                                <p>I may have been too hard on Congressman Martin’s Sabo suggestion to increase the interest rate on Treasury bonds in the Social Security trust fund in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/david-frum-flip-flops-on-value-of.html">this post</a>.  I realized this as I re-read the brilliant critique of the recommendations of the Bush Social Security commission from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-18-02socsec.pdf">Peter Diamond and Peter Orszag</a>.  Page 26 of their <em>Reducing Benefits and Subsidizing Individual Accounts: An Analysis of the Plans Proposed by the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security </em>has a box entitled <em>Subsidizing the Individual Accounts Through a Low Interest Rate on the Liability Accounts</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By charging an interest rate on the liability accounts that is lower than the rate the Trust Fund earns on its balances, Models 2 and 3 impose costs on the Social Security system and subsidize the individual accounts. To see this, imagine $100 that is diverted from the Trust Fund into an individual account under Model 2. The $100 diverted into the individual account would trigger an entry of $100 in the worker’s liability account. Model 2 charges an interest rate on the liability accounts of 2 percent per year (after inflation). If the worker were 40 years away from retirement, the interest charges would cause the $100 entry to grow to $221 (in constant dollars) by the end of the worker’s career. If the $100 had been retained by the Trust Fund, however, it would have grown to $326 by the time the worker retired. The difference between the amount in the liability account ($221) and the amount that would have accrued in the Trust Fund ($326) represents a subsidy to the individual account and a loss to the Trust Fund. Such a subsidy arises whenever the interest rate on the liability account is below the interest rate the Trust Fund earns on its reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s going on with these two very different proposals?  The Federal government can be thought of as two divisions: the Social Security Trust Fund and the General Fund (OK, the latter has many subdivisions).  If the government is thought of as some multinational enterprise with multiple divisions, then the intercompany interest rate could diverge from the arm’s length rate as defined by <a href="http://www.intltaxlaw.com/SHARED/TRANSFER/regs.htm#Regs.%20%C2%A7%201.482-2">section 1.482-2(a)</a> of the U.S. Treasury regulations.  </p>
<p>Multinationals could potentially set non-arm’s length interest rates.  At times, they think appealing to the “safe harbor” of the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) curtails the IRS from challenging non-arm’s length rates.  One should note, however, that the AFR is set to track market rates.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, President Bush’s commission advocated having below market rates paid to the Trust Fund, which would clearly worsen any alleged shortfall.  Why would the White House want to do so?  Because they have no will to address the General Fund deficit besides raiding our retirement benefits. </p>
<p>Sabo on the other hand wants an above market rate paid to the Trust Fund.  On Feb. 23, <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/02/index.html#000204">William Polley</a> sensibly noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyway, back to Rep. Sabo&#8217;s plan. His plan would simply shift the financing from the pay-as-you-go Social Security system to the general fund&#8230; until (at least) 2080. He&#8217;s talking about doing exactly what I would try to avoid&#8230; for 40 years. This is more than just a counterpoint to the &#8220;raiding the trust fund&#8221; argument. This would institutionalize a long run imbalance in the pay-as-you-go Social Security system&#8211;a long period of deficit without a corresponding surplus. In my rank ordering of approaches to the Social Security issue, this ranks right below doing nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the General Fund has a very serious long-term shortfall even if it is not asked to bail out the more modest Social Security Trust Fund.  Bottom line – we could set non-arm’s interest rates between these two divisions, but I’m not sure if either Bush’s version or Sabo’s version would be a wise policy change.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/mitchell200503010824.asp">NRO oped</a> Daniel J. Mitchell claims it does:</p>
<blockquote><p>VAT might have some theoretically attractive features, but it is a perniciously effective way of raising revenues and inevitably leads to bigger government. The best evidence comes from Europe. Back in the mid-1960s, the burden of government in Europe wasn’t that much higher than it was in the United States. Tax revenues consumed about 30 percent of gross domestic product in Europe. The U.S. had a small advantage: The tax burden, including state and local governments, was about 27 percent of GDP. But then European governments started adopting the VAT. Denmark was the first to do so in 1967. France and Germany followed, with many other European nations imposing the tax within 5 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not expert on the history of this tax but <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/v1/valueadd.asp">this source</a> has it being introduced by France in 1954.  Current VAT rates are given by <a href="http://www.trade.gov/td/tic/tariff/eu_vat.htm">this source</a>.  The VAT rate varies across nations, so one might like to see how this correlates with the spending to GDP ratio.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to a very good discussion on spending and taxes in general from <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew">Matthew Yglesias</a> entitled “The Looming Crisis”, where Matthew takes on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/garbage-from-greenspan.html">Greenspan’s Garbage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, raising the requisite tax revenue would be politically difficult. Especially in an era when one of the country&#8217;s top economic policy officials can testify before congress in a manner that simply assumes that spending 40.7 percent of GDP on the public sector would be intolerable. International comparisons, however, indicate that it&#8217;s perfectly tolerable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that unlike Dr. Mitchell, Matthew provides a nice table of OECD data as to the spending to GDP ratio dating back to 1987.  I’m not sure if I can detect a relationship between the VAT rate and the ratio of spending to GDP using Matthew’s data with that from the International Trade Administration but even if there is some positive correlation (which Dr. Mitchell fails to provide), is it higher tax rates leading to higher spending or is the cause-and-effect in the other direction?  </p>
<p>Oh, but now I’m asking way too much from the Econopundits at NRO.  Of course, if the NRO has any serious suggestions for curbing government spending – maybe they’d like to share them with us.</p>
