                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>First, the good news: Oil futures (West Texas Intermediate:WTI) for May delivery are <em>only</em> $52.95 per barrel, off from the recent high of $58.28 per barrel.  And it appears gas prices may be peaking for the current driving season at around $2.30 per gallon.  Perhaps that will be the end of stories like the following for awhile: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/nm/20050410/bs_nm/energy_gasoline_retail_dc_1">&#8220;Average Gas Price at Record $2.29/gal&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>But oil prices are still substantially higher than a year ago.  WTI was selling for under $35 per barrel in April 2004.  Now it is 50% higher.  So the question is: What will be the impact of these higher prices on the US economy?</p>
<p>Graphs like the following, from the <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">DOE</a>, are being used to show that <i>real</i> gas prices are still lower than prices in the early &#8217;80s.  That is true, but current real gasoline prices are higher than after the &#8217;73 oil price shock.  Note that this graph was produced at the end of last year and the current price of $2.30 per gallon is substantially higher than the DOE&#8217;s projection of $2.00 per gallon.</p>

<p>Both the &#8217;73 and &#8217;79 oil price shocks preceded recessions in the US.  After the &#8217;79 oil crisis, unemployment peaked at 10.8% in 1982.  After the &#8217;73 price shock, unemployment <em>only</em> reached 9%.  It is not comforting that the real price for gasoline is above the peak of the &#8217;73 crisis.</p>
<p>Dr. Altig of <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/energy_prices_n.html">Macroblog</a> has a graph showing US energy usage / real GDP for the last 50 years.  Altig&#8217;s graph shows the US economy has become steadily more efficient in terms of GDP per unit of energy consumed.  But for this post, I will focus on the impact of the price of oil.  The following graph shows the US consumption of oil, in millions of barrels per day.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USOil.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USOil.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After peaking in the late &#8217;70s, US oil consumption declined for several years.  This was due to a combination of a US recession, more efficient automobiles, less oil in electricity generation and more efficient industry.  The following graph shows oil consumption by sector.  The industrial sector has never returned to the 1979 consumption levels (due to a combination of efficiencies and substitutes) and &#8220;other uses&#8221; has also declined significantly, primarily because electricity generation has moved away from oil. This leaves motor fuel and &#8220;other transportation&#8221; as the major growth sectors for oil consumption.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/oilsector.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/oilsector.jpg"></a> </p>
<p>This indicates that any reduction in oil consumption will have to come mainly from transportation.  To reduce oil consumption for transportation, people will have to drive less, buy more efficient vehicles, or substitutes, suitable for transportation, will have to be found.</p>
<p>The next graph shows total US oil consumption and imported oil consumption, in dollars, as a % of GDP.  US oil consumption was around 2% of GDP until the 1973 oil crisis when it jumped to 2.8% of GDP.  After the 1979 oil shock, oil consumption jumped to 6% of GDP.  For comparison, in 2004 oil consumption was 2.2% of GDP (imported oil was 1.27% of GDP).   </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USoilgdp.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USoilgdp.jpg"></a>     </p>
<p>On the above graph, I added the impact of $40 and $60 oil for 2005 (enlarge graph to see).  For $40 oil, consumption will be almost 2.5% of GDP.  For $60 oil, consumption will be 3.7% of GDP &#8211; substantially higher than during the 1973 oil crisis.  For this calculation, I assumed 6% nominal GDP growth for 2005.</p>
<p>NOTE: These prices for oil are the average contract price paid for various grades of oil.  This average is usually $5 to $10 below the spot price of WTI.</p>
<p>Note that I also plotted the percentage of GDP used to consume imported oil.  Although imported oil keeps US energy costs lower than otherwise (we would have to use expensive substitutes to replace the oil), it also removes money from the US economy.  At $60 per barrel, imported oil alone will be 2.1% of GDP in 2005.</p>
<p>The importance of imported oil is growing.  The following graph shows the quantities of domestic and imported oil for the last 50 years.  (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0501.html">SOURCE: DOE</a>) This chart includes &#8220;Natural Gas Plant Liquids&#8221; and &#8220;Other Domestic Sources&#8221; as part of the domestic supply.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/oilsource.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/oilsource.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In summary, both oil consumption as a % of GDP and real gas prices, will probably be higher in 2005 than after the 1973 gas crisis, but lower than after the 1979 oil shock.  Economist&#8217;s predictions on what price of crude would push the economy into recession have been moving higher.  (See Kash&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/oil-prices-and-recession.html">post</a> from Friday.  I think a sustained contract price of over $50 (or WTI price close to $60) would probably trigger a consumer recession in the US.</p>

                                <p>My imagination runs amok while wondering how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/chinas-real-weapon.html">China&#8217;s New Weapon</a> could prove useful to China&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;We regret to tell you that we have been disappointed about your decision regarding issue X.  (Selling new arms to Taiwan?  Supporting a Taiwanese declaration of independence?  Increasing pressure on N. Korea beyond what China wants?  Providing public support for a Chinese pro-democracy movement?  Supporting a move by the Philippines to begin drilling for oil in the Spratly Islands?  The possibilities are numerous.)  We find ourselves in the awkward position of pointing out to you that your decision poses great problems for us.  We would like to urge you to reconsider your decision.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The US to China:</strong> &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;Ah.  We understand, and if there is nothing that we can do to change your mind, we will respect your decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, on an unrelated matter and in the spirit of friendship and international cooperation, we thought we should let you know that our central bank has recently told us that its economists recommend a reallocation of its rather large investment portfolio.  Unfortunately, the portfolio managers inside the PBOC tell us that this will involve selling very large quantities of our US Treasury securities.  Furthermore, they tell us that due to some internal bureaucratic restrictions, those sales will have to happen in several large blocks of roughly $50 billion at a time, over the course of just two or three days.  We in the Foreign Ministry hope to be able to change their mind about this, but I fear that our influence may be insufficient to prevent these actions by the central bank.  We hope that this will not cause you too much of an inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The US to China: </strong>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221; Pause. &#8220;Thank you for telling us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, we haven&#8217;t actually made any <em>final</em> decisions about issue X.  We&#8217;re still considering all sides of the issue.  Our guiding principle regarding issue X has always been flexibility.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;We are so glad to hear that, and we knew that you would agree with us that our mutually beneficial relationship is far too important to jeapordize over such a trivial matter as issue X.  We also agree with you that nothing is more important than flexibility in today&#8217;s modern world, with all of its complicated financial and political relationships.  We know you will be sensitive to the impact that your decisions about issue X will have on China.  And we will do everything in our power to urge our central bank to be just as sensitive to your needs as you are to ours. We should also note that it will apparently still be a little while before our central bank makes any final decisions about its portfolio allocations.  I&#8217;m certain that issue X will be resolved to our mutual satisfaction before that time.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Please keep in touch, and have a nice day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The NYTimes ran a story yesterday about the potential dangers that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/international/asia/08china.html?hp&#038;ex=1113019200&#038;en=fc61c1ca76990b51&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">Chinese Navy&#8217;s rapid buildup</a> may pose to the US.  But China’s increasing military power may well be less important than another weapon that China has acquired over the past few years: substantial control over the fate of the US economy.</p>
<p>Consider that China’s central bank probably holds a few hundred billion dollars worth of US government securities – more than any other single investor in the world aside from the Bank of Japan.  Note that this compares to a total stock of marketable Treasury securities of about $3,000 bn (excluding those held by the Fed and S&#038;L governments), about $1,200 bn of which are held privately in the US and $1,800 of which are held by foreign individuals and institutions.</p>
<p>What would happen if China decided to dump, say, $100 bn of US government bonds on the market all at once?  In fact, what would happen if China simply <em>threatened</em> to do so?  I have no idea what the precise impact on prices and yields would be (though I would be interested to see the estimates of anyone knowledgeable), but I can confidently say that interest rates would end the day higher than they began it.  Probably a lot higher.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of argument, suppose that it turns out that China has enough clout in the bond market to make long-term US interest rates rise by a full percentage point whenever they want.  Just because China has such power doesn’t mean that it would ever do so.  After all, China also has very powerful weapons in the form of nuclear missiles… but in practice, those weapons are not really useful against the US in any conflict other than total war.  Is China’s influence over the US bond market similarly irrelevant, or is it actually a useful weapon?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to think about the impact that it would have on both the US and on China.  Possible effects on the US:
<ul>
<li>The effects on the US’s financial markets would be immediate, though possibly only short-term. The US stock market would tumble.  I would find it easy to believe that a one-day rise in long-term rates of 1% could easily trigger a stock market fall of 10%.  The dollar would also immediately fall, probably by a lot.  If these changes in asset prices persisted for a period of some weeks, we would then expect there to be noticeable effects on the real economy&#8230;</li>
<li>The sharp jump in US government bond yields would feed through to mortgage and consumer rates.  Prospective home buyers would immediately have to seriously reevaluate their purchasing plans, and I would expect real estate volume to dry up, very quickly.  The real estate bubble would be over.</li>
<li>The sharp fall in household wealth would probably cause households to curtail spending.  This would be exacerbated by any increase in import prices due to the fall in the dollar.</li>
<li>Business investment spending plans would be put on hold.  The tremendous uncertainty created by such a dramatic move in interest rates would cause a lot of businesses to stop in their tracks, if not directly because of the higher interest rates, then because of the doubts about their future course.</li>
<li>Put these effects together, and I can easily imagine US economic growth coming to an immediate halt.  If interest rates did not recover within a few weeks, a US recession seems entirely plausible to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the effects on China?
<ul>
<li>The Chinese CB (the PBOC) would take enormous capital losses on its reserves.  Such a rise in interest rates would probably wipe out 5% of the value of their bonds (i.e. losses of $10 or $20 billion) even before exchange rate changes are taken into account.  With the possible exchange rate changes, total capital losses could easily total $50-$100 bn.  The real significance of capital losses on the PBOC&#8217;s balance sheet is the subject of some disagreement, but everyone would agree that it would represent some loss for China.</li>
<li>If the PBOC actually sold US bonds (rather than simply threatening to do so), it would probably have to buy back some of the sterilization bonds that they had previously issued in order to keep China’s money supply from shrinking.  This however, could be seen as a good thing for China’s financial system, not a bad.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s interest rates would rise along with the US&#8217;s.  However, since so much of China&#8217;s credit market seems to be allocated by mechanisms other than price, I would expect the real effects of this to be less disruptive than on the US.</li>
<li>If the financial market disturbances were long-lived enough to have real effects so that the US economy slowed, China’s exports would also probably slow.  This would tend to push the Chinese economy toward a recession of its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, it seems that the costs to China are significantly smaller than the costs to the US.  Furthermore, one could argue that the US government is more sensitive to the political fallout of economic dislocation than the Chinese government, simply due to the nature of democracies and totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>So is this a useful weapon for China?  I think that it probably is.  The tremendous financial volatility and sharp falls in asset prices that would follow financial saber-rattling by the Chinese would impose enormous costs on the US, while imposing moderate costs on China.  By making this calculus clear to the US government, I think that the Chinese government probably will be able to use its leverage over US financial markets as a real bargaining chip if a serious disagreement arises between China and the US in the future.  </p>
<p>Is there any defense against this weapon?  There might be a couple.  Perhaps the best defense would be to enlist the aid of allies (e.g. the Bank of Japan) to buy up as many bonds as the Chinese sell.  And naturally, the Fed would take center stage in the defense of the US, by also buying bonds and rapidly expanding the US&#8217;s monetary base to try to mitigate effects on the US&#8217;s financial markets.  Whether such defenses would be fully effective is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>
<p>One last note: I think that China’s motives for its accumulation of dollar assets are purely economic – the BWII system has provided enough important benefits to the Chinese economy to justify its support thus far.  The geopolitical benefits to China that I’ve described are simply a side-effect.  Nevertheless, if I were one of China’s leaders, I would feel quite pleased with this addition to my arsenal.</p>

                                <p>Blogger Timothy tries to blame Arthur Andersen for the <a href="http://www.onehandedeconomist.com/blog/archive/2005_04_07.php#a000015">following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I thought I&#8217;d further demonstrate this with a fictional balance sheet I made in Excel. Let&#8217;s suppose I have a business called Money Corp LTD, and that I start off with $1,000 … Gee, I think to myself, what a shrewd investor I am, I&#8217;m running a surplus! Thusly, I get together with the Money Corp Board and we decide to use that $1,000 of bond revenue to pay each of the nine directors and myself a bonus of $100. Total bonus: $1,000… But, hold on, something&#8217;s rotten in the state of Money Corp. I don&#8217;t actually have those bonds any more, because I sold them to someone who isn&#8217;t me… This is exactly what&#8217;s going on with Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you skip all the Luskin-ite nonsense in between, you don’t need his Excel spreadsheets to understand what Timothy is really saying here.  George W. Bush is indeed selling off our Social Security Trust Fund assets to someone other than American workers.  Imagine that the initial $1000 was owed to the defined benefits plan for the workers of Money Corp LTD and that the shareholders are the rich folks who supported Bush-Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and are not getting income tax cuts financed by raiding the lock box.  Yes – Timothy has explained it all so well. So why are Timothy and Don Luskin supporting this Social Security Thievery?</p>

                                <p>Kash addressed below the premise of whether higher oil prices will lead to a U.S. recession.  As I was grabbing the car keys, Kathleen Hayes said something about how oil prices dramatically dropped so I wondered two things: (1) could this <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200503111239.asp">Kudlow forecast</a> be sensible; and (2) might my $20 buy more than 8 gallons at the corner Arco?  It turns out I got only 7.9 gallons for the $20 and <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/pdf/sum0405.pdf">these folks</a> are saying I should get used to it.  </p>
<p>Our friend <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/greenspan_and_o.html">David Altig</a> finds someone blaming Alan Greenspan.  While David is not buying this argument, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504080923.asp">James Tamny</a> shows us why Milton Friedman does not write for the <em>National Review</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since oil is priced in dollars, it was only natural that the oil price rose substantially in the 1970s. Early in that decade, oil “shocks” were a U.S. phenomenon related to the Federal Reserve’s failure to maintain dollar stability, and a world phenomenon to the extent that other currencies followed the dollar’s inflationary descent … Producers could drill for oil during the Bretton Woods era highly confident that they would receive $2.50 a barrel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has Tamny confused nominal price stability and stability of relative prices?  Certainly the relative price of oil has varied but would a return to the gold standard change that?  For some perspective, let’s return to another post by <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/energy_prices_n.html">David</a>. Tamny may have a small point in the statement that the real dollar devaluation lessened the reduction in European and Japanese oil demand, but the high relative price for oil was due to a reduction in the supply from OPEC.  And unless the Saudis cared only about buying gold, Nixon’s decision to allow the dollar to float was not the cause of the reduction in supply.  </p>
<p>Kudlow’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/nrof_canto.asp">colleagues</a> suggest that U.S. economic growth is the cause of high oil prices.  Actually, much of the growth in world demand coming from other nations as David’s graph shows the U.S. has been cutting back on oil consumption – at least relative to our income.  The NRO confidence that higher oil prices will lead to a vast increase in U.S. supply of oil strains credibility.  Let me elaborate with my only quibble with David’s second oil post and his graph, which shows U.S. production relative to real GDP at about one-third of its 1950 level.  Since U.S. real GDP is about six times what it was in 1950, doesn’t his graph show U.S. production is double what it was back in 1950?  </p>
<p>I doubt higher prices will lead to a massive increase in our production.  And Tamny has failed to elaborate why a return to the gold standard would either increase production or lead to more conservation.  The only conservation that might come out of this Nixon/Greenspan-bashing would be if the NRO crowd decided to hold a conference on oil prices in Los Angeles – as I’ll do my part and simply stay home.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Under Kash’s post MN Jim suggests we check the website of  <a href="http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/publications/energy_reviews/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/zip/oil_slidepack_compressed_2004.zip">BP</a> &#8211; which was not only anticipating my post but also a very good suggestion as the PowerPoint slide has a lot of useful historical data on world production and consumption by region.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Over the past week or so I’ve been thinking about the merits of the two competing scenarios that I spun out for you <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/tale-of-two-landings-part-i.html">last week</a>: the soft landing versus the hard landing for the US’s CA imbalance.  After playing around with some simple spreadsheet models of the US’s national accounts, here are some of my conclusions:</p>
<p>1. Even a gradual fall in the US’s CA deficit to a “modest” 4% of GDP by 2009 (as I described in my soft landing scenario) will require a rise in personal savings rates from about 1.5% today to about 4% in 2009.  </p>
<p>2. Such a gradual fall in the CA deficit also implies that (a) the US’s marginal propensity to import falls noticeably, and/or that (b) the US export growth rate rises to about 7-9% per year for three or four years in a row.</p>
<p>3. Changes (1) and (2) will not happen by themselves.  In fact, it’s hard for me to see why they would ever happen except in response to significant changes in US interest rates (and other asset prices) and the dollar exchange rate.  I am not convinced that a slow and moderate rise in interest rates would be enough to cause such a dramatic change in savings behavior in the US, or that a gradual dollar depreciation would be enough to cause such a sustained boom in exports.</p>
<p>4. The soft landing scenario assumes that Asian CBs maintain the BWII system to keep the dollar from weakening rapidly.  But it would be extremely difficult for them to allow the dollar to weaken gradually.   The history of gradual fixed-exchange rate realignments is not good.  That’s because a small change in a fixed exchange rate typically leads to <em>increased</em> speculative flows, not decreased speculative flows, which means that the fixed exchange rate becomes even more expensive to maintain than it was before.  So a gradual depreciation of the dollar is a feat that I doubt the Asian CBs (or anyone else) could achieve.</p>
<p>5. Hence, the soft landing scenario, in which the BWII system continues, the US dollar does not fall, and interest rates rise only moderately, will not bring about a gradual improvement in the US’s CA deficit.  The Asian CBs can keep BWII going for a while longer, if they want&#8230; but the US’s CA deficit will not fall on its own if they do so.  And so they will have to be willing to keep BWII going in the face of US CA deficits of 5, 6 or 7% of GDP for the foreseeable future. Rather than a soft landing for the US CA deficit, that scenario really contains no landing at all.  </p>
<p>So after spending a week thinking hard about the plausibility of the soft landing scenario, I just don’t find it believable.  No, I think I’m back to my original opinion here: the US’s CA simply will not adjust without significant price changes:  higher interest rates, lower asset prices, and a weaker dollar.  Due to the nature of international financial speculation, I fear that it will be impossible for such price changes to take place gradually.  So those price changes will not happen gradually, but instead will happen quickly.  And rather painfully, I fear.</p>

<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_recession1.jpg"></p>
<p>What conclusions do I draw from this?  First, economists often do no better than anyone else when it comes to predicting the impact of exogenous events on the economy.  Second, most economists are pretty good at admitting they were wrong and revising their predictions <em>ex post</em>, in the face of evidence that their previous guesses were probably wrong.  </p>
<p>For whatever reason, lots of economists feel that they&#8217;ve learned something about the resilience of the US economy to high oil prices over the past year.  Maybe they&#8217;re right&#8230; or maybe we just haven&#8217;t waited long enough to really tell.</p>

                                <p>Now that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/04/april_fools_day.html">Brad DeLong</a> shows us that <a href="http://nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200504061344.asp">Donald Luskin</a> is inconsistent, let’s provide Luskin with a few relevant samples of “junk science”.  </p>
<p>My favorite quick reference for financial economics is the webpage of <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar">Aswath Damodaran</a>.  Under Research and Papers is his working paper entitled Estimating Risk Premiums, which uses the same Gordon growth model that Baker-DeLong-Krugman used. It is true that Andrew Samwick and Greg Mankiw challenged the original Dean Baker formulation suggesting payout ratios might rise if growth slowed down with Mankiw appealing to the Miller-Modigliani 1961 proposition.  But as we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/mankiw-on-baker-delong-krugman-paper.html">here</a>, the endogenous payout ratio does not fully answer Dean’s original question for reasons that Damodaran’s writings about growth, payout ratios, and the valuation of the firm demonstrate.  As I suggested in a comment to Andrew, I need to work on exactly how this works.  </p>
<p>Luskin’s main argument seems to be there is some free lunch based on the ability to transform the modest returns from bonds into higher expected returns from stocks – all the time ignoring the extra risk from such portfolio reallocation.  Neither Robert Barro nor Gary Becker buy into this proposition.  If they are Marxists, that’s news to me.  Then again, both of these conservative economists are familiar with Harry Markowitz’s “Portfolio Selection” (1952) and James Tobin’s “Liquidity Preference as Behavior Towards Risk”, which explain the basis for the Barro-Becker argument.  </p>
<p>I have often wondered if Mr. Luskin has read any of the great works in financial economics from the last half century.  But rather than attacking Brad as a supposedly being a Marxist, maybe Luskin might notice that Brad has suggested potential reasons why the Barro-Becker-PGL argument might not be all there is to this issue.  Then again – I suspect Luskin would consider all of the innovations in financial economics over the past half century “junk science”.  After all, the lessons from modern financial economics do not quite square with supporting Bush’s proposal to kill Social Security.</p>

                                <p>Tyler reads <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/04/keynesian_econo.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/04/when_do_fiscal_.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When can deficit spending in a recession help?</p>
<p>1. When it is part of a stable and sustainable structure of economic policy, so that nobody fears that it is the beginning of a process of rampant inflation or expropriation. In that case deficit spending will have no deleterious effects on investment, and to the extent that it gets more money into the hands of those who are temporarily short of cash it will boost demand and employment. </p>
<p>2. When things are already so bad (as in 1933 and 1934) that there is no investment anyway: if business confidence is already at its nadir, deficit spending cannot do any harm by reducing investment, and does good by putting people to work and boosting their incomes and their demand. </p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds right to me.  And the first point may have something to do with why the Bush tax cuts have failed to restore full employment.  After all, investment demand as a share of GDP is still below the levels before 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A reader notes that Tyler was quoting Brad.  And I’m remiss for not adding Brad’s ending:</p>
<blockquote><p>You thus see that my view is closely related to (but not identical to) the short-run long-run distinction you draw. The longer-run are deficits, the more likely they are to cause a crisis of private-sector investor confidence. The shorter-run are deficits, the more likely they are to be part of a stable, sustainable structure of economic policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent statement of the view that we call Rubinomics.  I’ll bet the current CEA has expressed this views, but it seems their political bosses are not listening.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Kudlow’s <a href="http://nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504060758.asp">latest</a> is entitled <em>Evidence, Evidence, and More Evidence</em>.  Yet, he fails to link to or even mention the title of a single study preferring to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before making her strange assertions, Bernasek should have referenced the work of Harvard economists Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw, along with numerous articles published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Then there’s the work of Columbia economist Glenn Hubbard and Princeton economist Harvey Rosen. These are no small thinkers when it comes to tax theory. Each has found a high correlation between lower tax rates and higher economic growth. Then there’s the Nobel-prize-winning Edward Prescott of Arizona State and Robert Mundell of Columbia. Add two more sound minds to the lower-tax, higher-growth list. Sure, the above economists have been Republican advisors at one time or another, but Bernasek could have found a trove of data contrary to her thesis had she looked to the “non-partisan” OECD, IMF, or Congressional Budget Office. Then there’s the real-world evidence. Let’s start overseas.</p></blockquote>
<p>So as he attacks Anna Bernasek, I guess she is left wondering which scholarly papers Kudlow refers to.  Lawrence does refer to the 1920’s and the 1960’s when aggregate demand stimulus got us closer to full employment.  He seems to think the Clinton boom was due to Clinton’s tax cuts.  That’s odd.  And of course, he had to mention his hero – Ronald Reagan.  I guess Larry has not read Mankiw’s textbook that noted the fiscal fiasco of the 1980’s lowered savings and investment and hence long-term growth.  </p>
<p>This is why Bruce Bartlett needs outlets for his honest op-eds other than the National Review.</p>
