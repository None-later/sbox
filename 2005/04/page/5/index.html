                                <p>Is there a housing bubble?  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-speculation-is-key.html">Yes</a>.  But what happens after the boom?  This post will address the likely bust in the housing market and next week&#8217;s post will discuss the possible impact of the housing slowdown on the general economy.</p>
<p>For those readers still uncertain about the housing bubble, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59515-2005Apr16.html">here</a> is an excellent article from the front page of today&#8217;s Washington Post. For those in denial, Dr. Shiller <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/comment/0,11268,1461424,00.html">discussed</a> booms this week: &#8220;There are always popular explanations for the boom, but they are obviously not always right.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Housing &#8220;bubbles&#8221; typically do not &#8220;pop”, rather prices tend to deflate slowly in real terms, over several years. Historically real estate prices display strong persistence and are sticky downward. Sellers want a price close to recent sales in their neighborhood, and buyers, sensing prices are declining, will wait for even lower prices.  This means real estate markets do not clear immediately, and what we usually observe is a drop in transaction volumes.</p>
<p>Even though prices tend to deflate slowly, they can still drop significantly over time.  On the following graph are the nominal price declines for three busts: Los Angeles in the early &#8217;90s, San Antonio in the mid &#8217;80s (the oil patch bust) and Hartford starting in &#8217;89.  The peaks of all three housing booms are aligned on the left and the relative price declines are plotted by quarter after the local market’s price peak.</p>

<p>For all three busts, the prices steadily declined over many quarters.  Although these are three of the worst busts of the last 25 years, the price action is representative of other housing busts.  In real terms (adjusted by CPI less shelter), the price declines are even more dramatic:</p>

<p>Data Sources: OFHEO <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp">House Price Index</a>, BLS <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/home.htm">CPI less Shelter</a>.</p>
<p>In real terms, prices in the Hartford market declined for over 8 consecutive years before reaching a nadir of almost 40% off the peak price of 1989.   The other markets experienced similar declines:<br />

<p>When the current boom ends, the coasts will probably experience the largest declines.  This boom is more widespread than previous booms according to an <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html">FDIC  report</a> released in February, and the bust will probably be more widespread too.  The FDIC reported: &#8220;Our count of 33 boom markets in 2003 is the highest witnessed at one time during the past 25 years—1988 ranks second, with 24 booms. Moreover, the 2003 boom markets account for roughly 40 percent of the nation&#8217;s population base, contributing to the impression that this is a nationwide phenomenon.&#8221; </p>
<p>All areas might not see declining prices, but transaction volumes will probably  decrease nationwide.  In the early &#8217;90s bust, the bubble areas like Los Angeles and Hartford saw declining nominal prices, but the nationwide nominal prices didn&#8217;t decline.  Nationwide real prices did decline about 8% over a 6 year period.  But more dramatic was the precipitous drop in the volume of New Home Sales at the start of the bust:  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/PriceSales.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/PriceSales.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Home builders tend to adjust to lower prices and New Home Sales rebounded after a few years.  Transactions of existing home sales are more susceptible to declining prices and stayed depressed for a longer period.</p>
<p>In summary, my expectation is for slowly declining prices in much of the United States and significantly lower transaction volumes nationwide.</p>
<p>What is the impact of falling prices and lower transaction volumes on the economy?  Obviously employment in real estate related occupations will fall.  This includes  Real Estate agents, mortgage brokers, home construction trades and other real estate related fields.  Also homeowners will withdraw less equity from their homes to use for consumption.</p>
<p>Next week’s post will discuss the possible impact of falling real estate related employment and less mortgage equity withdrawal on the general economy.</p>

                                <p>Angrybear readers might have already picked up on the fact that I am generally a free trade advocate.  One might then suspect I’d be praising the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504150851.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>.  But then Lawrence has to write:</p>
<blockquote><p>But you can blame U.S. textile makers. These businesses have been protected for nearly 30 years but they still can’t seem to compete. Why should consumers be denied choice simply because a handful of companies can’t cut the mustard? … Free trade helped all political parties and all world nations. It was not zero sum. It was &#8211; and is &#8211; win-win.</p></blockquote>
<p>I generally agree with Mr. Kudlow that free trade is not the cause of our current account deficits (never mind the fact that Kudlow supports the Bush fiscal trainwreck that is one contributor) and I’m hoping against all hope that this Administration does not impose duties on garment imports.  But the notion that everyone gains from free trade is not a credible argument – especially in parts of South Carolina.  </p>
<p>Memo to the National Review: leave the international trade issues to Bruce Bartlett and Bill Buckley.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Kudlow’s colleague <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200504150850.asp">John Tamny</a> just told Paul Volcker (and hence me as well) that Bush’s fiscal trainwreck is not a cause of the current account deficits.  You see – we are saving more according to this statistic:</p>
<blockquote><p>In it David Malpass (NRO financial writer and Bear Stearns chief economist) shows per capita assets in the U.S. of $89,800 that make us the top saving country in the world. (Japan is second at $76,900 per head.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This represents the level of assets whereas savings represents the increase in assets over time.  Real per capita wealth at the end of 2004 was lower than it was the end of 1999 for the U.S.  But neither Malpass nor Tamny get the point that their own measure shows we have had negative savings.</p>

                                <p>Now that you have sent more than your fair share to the IRS, you might be wondering why the Federal deficit is so high.  It turns out that when this clueless bear was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/irs-budget-penny-wise-pound-foolish.html">praising</a> Bob McIntyre and Max Sawicky, they were part of a <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001310.html">conference</a> addressing this issue.  Max even provides pictures.  Shorter Max: allocate IRS resources less towards going after the working poor and more to where the real money is.  He also provides a link to <a href="http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2005/04/050411_McIntyre.pdf">Bob’s paper</a>.  Pages 11 to 13 are a very good discussion of transfer pricing manipulation, which includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Or a company may have a very valuable asset, such as a trade name. If it transfers the ownership of that name to a low-tax place and then charges its taxable operations large royalties to use the name, it can avoid huge amounts in taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the game that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840198/qid=1113517951/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-4414318-7674360">David Cay Johnson</a> mentioned in his chapter “Letters to Switzerland”.  Tax attorney <a href="http://www.bnatax.com/tm/insights_Reform.htm">Robert T. Cole</a> critiqued Johnson with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the chapters in Perfectly Legal is entitled “Letters to Switzerland” in which Johnston alleges that a U.S. corporation can reduce its taxes by mailing the rights to intellectual property (IP) to a country that imposes no tax or a low rate of tax generally (or on the type of income which U.S. multinationals might locate there) in exchange for a payment that is far less than the true value of the transferred IP. Johnston notes that under the law “the price has to be reasonable,” but then goes on to give an example of a price that he regards as far less than reasonable and suggests that undervaluation is the norm. Whatever may have been the situation before and in individual cases, there are in place rules (and stricter enforcement) that should in most cases prevent the transfer of U.S. IP to foreign affiliates without full consideration. In 1982, §367(d) was added to the Internal Revenue Code to prevent transfers of U.S. IP for stock and in 1986 §482 was changed to add the commensurate-with-income standard for the transfer (or license) of intangibles to a related party. Thus, the Code now requires that a U.S. taxpayer take into account the full value of U.S. intangible property transferred overseas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cole is assuming that the “economist” working for the taxpayer provides an honest estimate of the value of the intangible asset.  But we often see “analyzes” where an intangible asset that generates high royalties is supposedly worth very little.  How?  By assumptions of discount rates that are so high or economic lives so short that even Lawrence Kudlow would refuse to publish the rubbish at the <em>National Review</em>.  </p>
<p>But when economists turn into hacks, the attorneys for both the taxpayer and the tax authority decide they are not worth very much.  Joe Garrett, a tax policy attorney with the Alabama Department of Revenue, has this neat <a href="http://www.mtc.gov/2004AnnualConferenceAgenda_files/Garrett.pdf">presentation</a> of how the game is blame at the state level.  Slide 6 asks “Is my economist better than your economist?”  What Joe is saying he has no use for economists who play what is known as the Comparable Profits Method (CPM) game.  You might ask – what is CPM?  It’s more rubbish to bait and switch the tax authorities into giving a pass to aggressive tax plays.  So why would any economists working for the tax authorities play the CPM game.  Perhaps poor training?</p>
<p>But there is another cost of this game playing.  Max noted some bizarre hearings held by Senator Roth:</p>
<blockquote><p>His staff staged a parade of witnesses who recounted horror stories of mistreatment at the hands of the IRS. The hearings led to legislation constraining IRS enforcement efforts, and pushing them to chase after the low-wage workers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>One might scoff at the notion that the taxman abuses multinationals.  Perhaps, but there are some multinationals that simply wish to avoid double taxation without enormous compliance costs.  Arm’s length pricing could be easy for them if they could find a smart and honest economist.  If they cannot, this pathetic game played by the enablers of tax cheats also tends to interfere with free trade.  Tax revenues are lost, honest taxpayers face absurd regulatory nonsense, and the economics profession is scoffed at by the tax attorneys who play the pesudo-economists for whores.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-i-how.html">Part I of this series</a>, I showed that the US spends a lot more money on health care – now over 50% more as a percent of GDP than France and the other industrialized nations. Additionally, the U.S. is the only country in my data for which less than half of health care spending is publicly financed, with the balance coming primarily from employers and out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>But what do we spend the extra 5% of GDP? It’s apparently not doctors. While the number of doctors in the US has increased steadily, we still rank low in terms of doctors per capita:</p>
<div><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/DocsPer1000.gif"></div>
<p>France has the most doctors per capita, while the US edges out Canada, the UK, and Japan. It’s often alleged that the US has more specialists and less general practitioners than other countries, which might explain why we spend more money yet have fewer doctors to care for us, per capita – we’re buying high priced specialists (I haven’t found data on international comparisons of specialist:generalist ratio.)</p>
<p>If it’s not doctors then it must be hospital care, right? Again, no. While all nations have shed hospital beds, France still has substantially more beds than the US. The U.S. does have more hospital beds than Spain, Sweden, and Finland:</p>
<div><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/BedsPer1000.gif"></div>
<p>Perhaps our doctors are simply more efficient, able to care for more patients with fewer beds? As it turns out, France and Finland have increased their efficiency (i.e., using fewer beds to produce more discharges) over the last 15 years or so. In the U.S., however, changes in hospital discharges have basically tracked the changes in hospital beds.</p>
<div><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/dischargesPer100k.gif"></div>
<p>A quick side note: the funny business you see with the UK lines in the last two graphs is most likely the result deregulation that took place in England in the 1990s (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.scirus.com/srsapp/sciruslink?src=sd&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DScienceSearch%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0047272702002165%26_version%3D1%26_returnURL%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.scirus.com%252Fsrsapp%252Fsearch%253Fq%253Dissn%25253A00472727%252BAND%252B%2528propper%2529%2526p%253D0%26md5%3D0a5d6a9d33f8c546e62ef5495a0d2f69">Propper et al., 2004</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the subject at hand, while we spend a lot more on health care, we don’t have more doctors or more hospital beds, rendering rather dubious the claim that other nations are able to spend so much less on health care because they have shortages and long waiting lines (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/waiting-for-health-care.html">yesterday’s post by Kash</a> for more on this point.)</p>
<p>If our extra spending is not buying us more doctors, nor more hospitals, then perhaps it’s going to drugs. While it’s true that spending on pharmaceutical products increased from 8% to 13% of health care spending, that change occurred as total spending on health increased from 10% of GDP to 15%. Putting those numbers together, pharmaceutical spending increased from a bit under 1% of GDP to a bit under 2% of GDP. That 1% of GDP is a lot of money, but it accounts for at most a fifth of the increase in health care costs in the US over the last decade.</p>
<p>Also note that other nations, such as France, Canada, and Finland had similar increases in their pharmaceutical spending ratios, yet have not had nearly as dramatic increases in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/TotalPctGDP.gif">total health care spending</a>.</p>
<div><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/PctDrugs.gif"></div>
<p>Based on the data I’ve been able to find so far, there’s simply no readily apparent sense in which consuming more inputs (doctors, hospital beds, drugs) accounts for a large portion of the additional health spending in the U.S. Since spending equals price times quantity, this leads to the conclusion that the prices of health inputs are higher here than in other industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Still, that might be money well spent if our inputs are of higher quality, able to produce more or better health output. I’ll take a look at this issue in Part III.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I wish to thank Angrybear reader CL for pointing out <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/10075">this bogus argument</a> for repealing the estate tax:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Most obviously, a farm or other small business that&#8217;s operating at a small profit would, presumably, not be profitable if it maintained the same revenue stream and expenses plus having to essentially buy back half the business from the government. That would mean, presumably, having to sell the business anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin?  If there were little profit, would not the fair market value of the farm be low?  And one does not have to buy back the business from the government – just pay the taxman.  </p>
<p>Let me take my earlier example of the family farm that is presumably worth $100 million as its expected operating profits are $10 million a year and it’s cost of capital is 10%.  Let’s also introduce the standard hack appraisal technique.  Even though the farm does not pay C corporate taxes, the appraiser assumes a 40% corporate profits tax rate and then discounts the remaining $6 million by some absurdly high discount rate – say 15%.  That’s how I got the $40 million.  If the appraiser does not fear the IRS agent, maybe he uses a 20% discount rate and then takes his customary haircut of 30% to 35% for some junk science garbage.  </p>
<p>Estimated value: $20 million with the tax bite being less than $10 million. The poor kids will have to borrow that much at an interest rate of 5%.  With $0.5 million in interest, the kids will have to survive on a mere $9.5 million per year.  Guess that is why there are not many real world examples of rich farmers losing the family farm.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/04/factcheck-and-senator-reids-calculator.html">Andrew Samwick</a> comes the latest from <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/article319m.html">FactDistort.org</a> who attack Senator Reid’s Social Security Calculator with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, the calculator is rigged. We find it is based on a number of false assumptions and deceptive comparisons. For one thing, it assumes that stocks will yield average returns of only 3 percent per year above inflation. The historical average is close to 7 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if the expected return to stocks is reasonably proxied by this historical return (I hear Brad DeLong will be presenting the Baker-DeLong-Krugman paper next week), why should we assume that rational individuals would wish to have their overall retirement portfolio risk rise in this way.  We have noted repeatedly the Barro-Becker position that individuals would not wish to do so, which means Senator Reid’s 3% assumption likely overstates the return since bonds are paying only a real return of 2%.  To be fair, <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/02/senator-reid-and-social-security.html">Andrew</a> has five particular challenges to Reid’s calculator including his fourth discussion, which goes directly to this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/004996.html">Jesse Taylor</a> points out the rest of the stupidity in this FactCheck attack on Senator Reid’s calculator.</p>

                                <p>Under Kash’s post on the repeal of the estate tax, reader Rupert posted a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>op-ed with the title Hiltonomics.  Yes, the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>is defending shifting the tax burden away from deprived Paris Hilton onto the rest of us.  Their thesis is that now that she does not have to worry about paying taxes, she will somehow consume less.  I’d rather think that the working poor get to enjoy her consumption even more as they watch cable television.  </p>
<p>But let’s take on this 45% nominal tax rate that they mention.  What they fail to tell their readers is how the game is worked by the estate planning tax attorneys.  Let’s say part of the estate is the family business that has value equal to $100 million.  Don’t think the attorneys will let the IRS collect $45 million when they can hire hack some hack appraiser that will produce some “analysis” that claims the business’s fair market value is only $40 million.  Why would an appraiser risk their professional reputation in this way?  Money and lots of it.  But now that this tax is being repealed, this particular cottage industry will die up.  So how can these tax cheat enablers reap large rewards for sophisticated dishonesty?  As you are filling out your tax returns and writing a large check to the IRS tomorrow, I hope to say more.</p>

                                <p>Okay, so much for the bad side of US health care: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">high</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-i-how.html">costs</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/performance-of-us-health-care-system.html">mediocre-to-poor average results</a>.  But what about the benefits that the &#8220;market-driven&#8221; US system provides?  Sure, the argument goes, the US health care system has some shortcomings &#8211; but at least it doesn&#8217;t involve long waiting lists for elective procedures, as is the case with countries that have primarily government-run health care. </p>
<p>It turns out that this is largely a myth.</p>
<p>Let me leave aside the point that waiting lists exist in abundance in the US for elective procedures &#8211; it&#8217;s just that when people are waiting in the US, they are waiting for a miraculous windfall of money to be able to afford the procedure, rather than waiting a few months until their number is called.  No, right now I want to focus on the myth that government-financed health care necessarily entails waiting lists for elective procedures.  </p>
<p>The data shows that many countries with &#8220;nationalized&#8221; health care systems have little or no waits for elective medical procedures.  A 2003 OECD working paper entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/31/10/17256025.pdf">Explaining Waiting Times Variations for Elective Surgery across OECD Countries</a>&#8221; by Luigi Siciliani and Jeremy Hurst provides some survey evidence of actual waiting times in various OECD countries.  The results of that survey are presented below.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/healthstats3.jpg">
<div>Note: figures for Canada and U.K. reflect median waiting times.</div>
<p>In all of the countries surveyed above (except the US), the government is responsible for the vast majority of health care spending. (See AB&#8217;s post from yesterday for specific data on that.)  Yet many of them have no waits for common elective procedures.  Clearly government financing of health care does not, in and of itself, cause waiting lists for medical procedures.  If a country has waiting lists for elective health care, that is due to some specific design flaws in its health care system, not because it is financed by the government.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper mentioned above goes on to take a look at the factors that lead to waiting lists.  The authors run some econometric tests that conclude that long waits for elective surgeries tend to happen when 1) countries don&#8217;t have enough acute care hospital beds (France and Germany have plenty, the UK doesn&#8217;t); 2) countries have older populations (older populations create more demand for elective procedures); and  3) countries pay specialists a salary rather than according to a fee-for-service formula.  </p>
<p>One last point of interest: what do consumers in other countries have to go through in order to receive these elective procedures?  The following table shows out-of-pocket costs for elective procedures, and who makes the decision about whether an individual should receive the service.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/healthstats4.jpg"></p>
<p>In countries with government-financed health care, the decisions are made by doctors &#8211; often by the specialists themselves &#8211; and out-of-pocket expenses to individuals are negligible.  Compare this to the case of the US, which is somewhat different in both dimensions.  What would an American expect to pay out-of-pocket for elective hip replacement, and how many hoops would they expect to have to jump through to get approval from their HMO?</p>
<p>So the next time you hear that the US health care system is better than those of other countries because Americans don&#8217;t have to wait for their health care, recognize this argument for the myth that it is.</p>

                                <p>As has been well covered in blogland (for just two examples, see <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_04/006095.php">Kevin Drum</a> and <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_04_10.php#005431">Josh Marshall</a>) and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50961-2005Apr13.html">traditional media</a>, today the House voted to permanently repeal the estate tax.  I have nothing substantive to add – my incredulity has long since been shattered by the Republicans’ apparently endless ability to reduce taxes on the rich and increase them on the middle class.  </p>
<p>Let me simply point out that the repeal of the estate tax means that future income taxes will rise by some $40 or $50 bn per year (since the CBO estimates a cost of $30-$35bn per year starting in 2006, and the future tax hike surely won&#8217;t happen during the first few years), depending on exactly when financial markets and/or the US’s political leaders decide that endless massive deficits are not sustainable.  To put that in very specific terms, today’s action will therefore cost an average-ish upper-middle income family (earning a net of about $70,000 per year) an extra $500 per year or so in taxes.</p>
