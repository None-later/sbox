                                <p>Neal Boortz tells his listeners: “But the left doesn&#8217;t want us to reduce our reliance on foreign oil”, which drew a response from the <a href="http://www.mahablog.com/2005.04.17_arch.html#1114173154442">Mahablog</a>.  Maybe Neil thinks the House GOP leadership is leftist given today’s comments from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/23/dems.radio.ap/index.html">Edward Markey</a>.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/04/debunking-daily-debunker.html">Mark Thoma</a> is fairly new to blogging, but he has already figured out that <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/articles/debunker-050422.html">Cato crowd</a> lies a lot with respect to the Social Security debate.  The most recent “Daily Debunker” from Cato discusses the Johnson-Flake proposal, which sounds to me like an old song: (a) reduce government expenditures by switching from wage indexing to price indexing; and (b) allowing workers to take half of their contributions and invest them anyway they want.  Yes, (a) addresses this alleged solvency problem by cutting benefits, but Cato claims that workers will be somehow better off because of (b).  </p>
<p>Even though their free lunch claims have been refuted numerous times over the years, the Cato crowd just keeps repeating these bogus arguments.  Mark does a nice job of debunking every aspect of this Cato op-ed.  I suspect the Cato crowd will simply ignore Mark as they ignore all real economics.</p>

                                <p>Jerry Bowyer has produced some incredibly bizarre spin with his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200504220855.asp">BuzzCharts</a> rants with the latest being an attack on something Paul Krugman recently wrote (surprise).  These BuzzCharts might provide great examples of how to lie with statistics, but the latest chart seems to say something other than what Jerry wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although BuzzCharts does not believe that the entire Clinton economy was a bubble, the last year or two clearly were. The jobs explosion was not financed with new profit, as it was in the past. It was paid for with old savings. Dotcoms were spending down pension-plan money mediated through venture-capital firms, and they weren’t creating new profit through each employee hired. Corporate profits per payroll job in 1998 were $14,928.90. Corporate profits per payroll job in 2004 were $21,593.51.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first glanced at his chart, two thoughts struck me: (a) how would this look in inflation adjusted terms; and (b) how much of the late 1990’s decline in his ratio was due to surging employment and how much of the rise after 2001 was from falling employment.  But then I looked at his numbers and thought that the 1998 after-tax profits per payroll job were quite high.  BEA reports that after-tax corporate profits were $469.96 billion for 1998 and BLS reports payroll employment that averaged 125.924 million for 1998.  So Jerry’s number is four times what it should be.  Did he take the quarterly flows (annualized) and sum them – rather than average them?  </p>
<p>Now back to my original query &#8211; just one comparison.  Note how Jerry displays nominal profits per job being higher in 2003 than it was in 1997?  If one adjusts for inflation, real profits per job were lower in 2003 than they were in 1997.  Real profits did rise but only by 4.3%, while employment rose by 5.9%.  Of course, the reason why employment rose by so little has more to do with the decline in employment after March 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Krugman’s “A Whiff of Stagflation” can be found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html?n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed%2FOp-Ed%2FColumnists">here</a>.  It features a very good discussion of the continuing weakness in the labor markets.  Maybe I should thank NRO for pointing Dr. Krugman’s op-ed out.  I do need to catch-up with his writings as well as the excellent materials on health care that AB and Kash have been providing!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/greenspan-on-renminbi.html">Greenspan’s remarks</a> about a possible renminbi revaluation also make me wonder exactly what the Fed would do if and when China does revalue.  <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/04/krugman-no-good-monetary-policy.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/landings_hard_a.html">David Altig</a> (among others) have had some interesting things to say about this question recently.  I want to do a more in-depth treatment if these issues in the future, but for starters here are some thoughts:
<ul>
<li>One of the dangers of end of Chinese exchange rate intervention is that interest rates in the US would spike as a result.  This means that the recent lack of control over long-term interest rates that the Fed has experienced (long term rates have refused to go higher even though the Fed would probably like them to) will continue, but in the opposite direction &#8211; long term interest rates will be higher (possibly much higher) than the Fed would like.  This lack of control over long-term (and maybe even medium-term) interest rates will make it difficult for the Fed to actually exercise any control over the real economy, at least for a time.  This will limit the effectiveness of the Fed&#8217;s response, whatever it is.</p>
</li>
<li>The biggest danger, it seems to me, is a financial meltdown in the US as the result of the spike in interest rates.  It is unclear to me exactly how vulnerable the balance sheets of firms like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and other large players in the bond market, are to a sharp rise in interest rates&#8230; but it strikes me as a serious possibility that some of them could be in trouble, which would have profound implications for both the US and international finacial systems.  Thus the first responsibility of the Fed, I think, is to ensure that there is enough liquidity in the system to avoid a cash crunch among financial firms.  I have in mind actions similar to those taken in 1998 as the LTCM affair was unfolding.
</li>
<li>After the initial financial shock has been absorbed, then the next most important job of the Fed retakes center stage &#8211; ensuring that inflationary expectations do not change.  Since there is little doubt that inflation would indeed jump in the wake of a revaluation, the Fed therefore will face the delicate task of switching, perhaps quite rapidly, from a position of ensuring liquidity to a position of dampening incipient inflation.  This, it strikes me, will be the hardest part of managing the landing for the US economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will those actually running the Fed see things this way?  If so, will they be up to this very formidable task?  It will not be easy.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve broken this into two posts, since it was getting rather lengthy.  First, let me point out some <a href="http://www.reuters.com/financeNewsArticle.jhtml?type=bondsNews&#038;storyID=8255796">interesting remarks</a> by Alan Greenspan yesterday.  He was, at least to me, surprisingly blunt:<br />
<blockquote>Fixing the renminbi to the dollar is beginning to significantly work to the detriment of Chinese economy. I think there is no question that two things are happening.</p>
<p>One is, in order to sustain the value of the renminbi to the value of the dollar, they&#8217;ve been purchasing very significant amounts of U.S. treasury issues.</p>
<p>In so doing, in order to prevent an inflationary money supply increase, they do what central bankers call sterilizing the purchase of foreign reserves&#8230; and they do this by selling bank issues, bank liabilities, denominated in their domestic currency, and so as they do that, that tends to prevent purchases of foreign reserves from expanding the money supply.</p>
<p>However, because there are interest rate caps in China, they&#8217;re finding some difficulty in selling an adequate amount of domestic-currency-denominated debt to absorb the excess. And that is creating imbalances that suggests that sooner rather than later, they are going to have to, for stability purposes, move their currency.</p>
<p>Secondly, they&#8217;ll also, by holding their exchange rate down, create a misallocation of resources in China in the sense they are subsidizing the capital stock associated with very large numbers of workers&#8230; [This] prevents standards of living from rising, because their intellectual technical capabilities are rising and if the exchange rate began to rise they would start to move capital into more efficient types of uses, which essentially would mean that output per hour would rise.</p>
<p>Holding their exchange rate where they are is preventing the growth in the terms that would be most valuable for China in the decades ahead. So as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it is very much in their interest to move.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, we in U.S. government have been in conversations with them to indicate that, in our judgment and in our experience, they should be moving sooner rather than later. And there is debate going on within China on this issue. I have no way of projecting when they will move. That they will move, I am reasonably certain.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, a question: why is China still holding on to its dollar peg if it&#8217;s not in its own interest?  I actually agree with Greenspan (and many others) that it is in China&#8217;s long-term best interests to revalue the yuan, but doesn&#8217;t this beg the question of why China isn&#8217;t doing it?  I haven&#8217;t come to any better answer to that question other than that the PBOC must figure that the substantial costs to dropping the dollar peg outweigh the substantial costs to keeping it.  They won&#8217;t revalue until that calculus changes.  Figuring out what will tip the balance on this cost-benefit analysis is the $64,000 question.</p>
<p>In my next post I want to tackle another relevant question.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-i-how.html">Part I of this series</a>, I examined spending on healthcare across industrialized nations from 1970 to the present. Throughout the 1970s the U.S. spent a bit more about 2 percent of GDP more on healthcare than other industrialized nations. Then, around 1980, the share of GDP spent on healthcare surged dramatically in the U.S., while remaining fairly flat in other countries. As a result, we now spend a full five percent of GDP more on healthcare than the next highest industrialized nation in my sample. Moreover, the public component of total health spending in the U.S. is a bit under half that of other nations. Finally, out-of-pocket spending in the U.S. is between 50% higher (Norway, Australia) and 300% higher (UK, France) than in other countries.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-ii.html">in Part II, I took a look at the inputs we purchase</a> with that additional. As it turns out, we do not have more doctors per capita (though we likely do have more specialists per capita) &#8212; France actually has the most doctors. Nor do we have more hospital beds or hospital discharges. And we rank fairly low in terms of spending on pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total healthcare spending. Because healthcare spending is so much higher in the U.S., it turns out that we do spend a bit more on drugs, as a percent of GDP, than other industrialized countries. Taking both factors into account, pharmaceutical spending has increased by about 1% of GDP, to a current total of 2% of GDP, and therefore represents at most one fifth of the additional money spent on health in the U.S. (5% of GDP).</p>
<p>The conclusion is that while we definitely spend more, we do not buy a substantially greater volume of inputs than other nations. The obvious explanation is that the prices of health inputs (doctors, hospital care, drugs,…) are higher in the U.S., but that is not the only possible explanation. It may be the case that inputs in the U.S. are higher quality, able to produce more or better health than other nations’ inputs. Or the U.S. population may be older and less healthy. Or the U.S. system may have higher non-clinical costs such as overhead and administrative costs. Or some combination of all these factors may be at work.</p>
<p>As the next two graphs show, it’s pretty clear that we purchase neither more health nor better health with our extra spending (<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">Kash showed this</a> as well). While the general trends are in the right directions across all countries, the U.S. currently has a higher infant mortality rate and a lower life expectancy at birth than France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Australia. And so it has more or less been since at least 1970:</p>
<div><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/infmort.gif"></p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/lifeexp.gif"></div>
<p>A final potential explanation for why we spend more on health yet have worse health outcomes is that Americans are intrinsically less healthy than citizens of other countries. For example, we may have more old people, smoke more, or have higher rates of obesity. An examination of these potentially confounding factors shows that we smoke the least and now have less people over 65 than any of the other nations I examined. Offsetting these factors, however, is the bad news that we are the most obese nation, with nearly 1/3 of the U.S. population having a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/calc-bmi.htm">BMI index</a> over 30.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/Over65.gif"></center></p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/smoking.gif"></center></p>
<p><center><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/obese.gif"></center></p>
<p>On balance, it’s probably close to a wash: we’re somewhat younger, and healthier in the very important smoking dimension, but less healthy in the also important obesity dimension. As a result, it is unlikely that the higher costs of healthcare in the U.S. are attributable to an intrinsically less healthy population.</p>
<p>Conclusion       </p>
<p>We spend a lot more money on health care, both in absolute terms and as a percent of GDP. Where does the money go?
<ul>
<li>We don’t purchase noticeably more health inputs such as doctors and hospital stays.   </li>
<li>We don’t have better health outcomes. In fact, we have the worst infant mortality and life expectancy numbers of all the industrial nations I examined. </li>
<li>And we’re neither more nor less intrinsically healthy than other countries.     </li>
</ul>
<p> While this is by no means a careful controlled study, nor even a regression analysis, application of Occam’s Razor and the process of elimination points to the two most likely explanations: high prices for healthcare inputs and significant inefficiencies in the transformation of those inputs into health outputs.</p>

Doolittle and Pombo are both Republicans from California.  For a defense of subsidizing hydrogen fuels, see <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2002/04/30/ncguest2.htm">this op-ed</a> by Robert C. Stempel.  As much as I hate to agree with the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm521.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a>, they seem to agree with me that much of the “tax incentives for special interests” is simply BS.  But when the Heritage Foundation calls passing an energy proposal part of a jobs agenda, even this Keynesian has to object.  Might we better spent the funds repairing the roads and building schools?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Michael Boskin makes his <a href="http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&#038;context=ev">case</a> for Bush’s Social Security deform, while <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001327.html">Max Sawicky</a> provides the critique.  Max briefly touched on two aspects of Michael’s paper that relate to utility theory.  Michael tried to argue that the income elasticity for government benefits (G) is less than unity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists use a term called the diminishing marginal utility of income to express the commonsense notion that as we get richer, the incremental value of yet more income declines .. keeping a constant ratio of government benefits to income, decade after decade as real incomes double, is unnecessary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max noted that if the marginal utility of private goods (P) also exhibit diminishing marginal utility, then a strong case for a progressive tax system follows.  Some economists might argue for an <a href="http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/gls.pl?fcd=dsp&#038;key=ordinal+utility">ordinal utility</a> rather than a <a href="http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/gls.pl?fcd=dsp&#038;key=cardinal+utility">cardinal utility</a> measure, but even if one accepts this cardinal utility premise, Boskin’s case for a declining government benefits to income does not follow from his premise.  If the marginal utility of both G and P fall as income rises, we would not say that the income elasticity of both G and P are less than one.  The allocation of income between G and P depends on the marginal rate of substitution, that is, on the marginal utility of G relative to the marginal utility of P.  </p>
<p>Michael also argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for younger workers, they consistently state when surveyed that they do not expect to receive any Social Security benefits; they expect the system to be bankrupt and gone by the time they retire. This, of course, is exaggeration; there will and should be a Social Security system when they retire, although it will change somewhat from the system now in place. It is bizarre to call slower increases relative to today’s levels a cut for people who expect nothing at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mex replied:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Here we are pressing the frontiers of utility theory. The fact of an economic change in material circumstances depends on what is in peoples&#8217; heads, not on the change itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can think of a couple of analogies.  Imagine a young investor purchased 100 shares of  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MACR&#038;t=1y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">Macromedia</a> for $2000 a year ago and never really thought much about this investment since.  Also imagine his broker called him today and said he’d give the young investor $2500 cash for his shares.  I guess the young investor would be elated that his broker would make a $500 gift to him even though the broker was about to pocket $1500 of the young investor’s wealth.  OK, the young investor would have to be naïve and if the broker would be less than honest.  But the Bush road show is telling young workers that the Trust Fund is bankrupt.  </p>
<p>I have a less politically charged analogy that parents of teenagers might appreciate.  Let’s imagine I have two teenage boys who daily consume an 8-ounce bag of potato chips.  Let’s also imagine that their mom decides to ration their consumption to “two servings” per kid per day.  Now if the kids think a serving equals 4 ounces, they might think that mom was going to let each kid consume a whole bag of chips each day.  But no, mom has read the label, which defines a serving as one ounce.  Will the kids be elated at their new ration or will they curse their parents upon realizing that their chip consumption has been cut in half.  If your kids would thank you, you are a better parent than me.</p>
