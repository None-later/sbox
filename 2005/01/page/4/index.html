                                <p>On his Monday version of China bashing, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0501/17/ldt.01.html">Lou Dobbs</a> interviewed Tim Ryan, a member of the Congressional Manufacturing Caucus. Lou twice said that trading with China represented “idiotic policies”.  Trade protectionist Ryan advocated sanctions of China for exporting goods to places like Europe, Japan, and the United States and then made this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>the only people really benefiting from this are the top 1 percent, or if you&#8217;re participating in a multinational corporation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressman Ryan forgot to mention American consumers benefit from free trade.  He forgot to mention Chinese workers benefit from being able to sell products abroad.  And lest we forget that American workers in the export sector benefit from free trade, an amazing bit of wisdom was uttered by trade protectionist Lou Dobbs: </p>
<blockquote><p>And just maybe, congressman, maybe, corporate America which is so concerned about product activity on the part of workers in this country, their education, their capacity &#8211; they did pretty well four years ago through the entire decade of the &#8217;90s and about 200 years before that. Maybe they&#8217;ll learn how to produce something they can sell abroad, because our exports are falling faster than we can see imports…</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been hard on Mr. Dobbs for his mercantilism, so I should admit that he closed this rant on a good note!<br /></p>

                                <p>Econoblog features this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB110573942734426639,00.html">interesting dialogue </a> between Arnold Kling and Max Sawicky.  Arnold’s comments are interesting but I still preferred Max’s dialogue with Andrew Samwick (see link to Voxbaby over at the right).  In several places, I wanted to take exception to Arnold’s comments and each case except one, Max made my point better than I could.  But he let this go:</p>
<blockquote><p>The way I would put it is that politicians have three credit cards &#8212; three ways of buying votes today and paying later. This involves making promises that will have to be redeemed by taxes collected in the future. Those three credit cards are the general budget, Social Security and Medicare.  Changing Social Security from a transfer scheme to one with personal accounts serves to take away the politicians&#8217; Social Security Credit Card. They no longer would have the authority to promise benefits out of future Social Security taxes. Incidentally, the tab that they already have run up would be moved over to the General Budget Credit Card, so that current benefits would wind up paid out of general revenues, which is something you said that you favor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three credit cards or just two?  Let me suggest a hypothetical romance between some fun-loving lad named George who did have two credit cards (general budget and Medicare) and some frugal lass named Nell who had a bank account that she continually contributed to (Social Security).  George has run up his credit cards and continues to spend more than he earns.  Nell, on the other hand, plans to add to her bank account for the next fifteen years and then retire off of her savings.  I would suspect privatization proponents such as Arnold and Robert Barro would consider it inappropriate for George to use Nell’s bank account to fund his lavish life style.  </p>
<p>But there is a big difference between their versions of privatization and the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/three-card-monte-following-up-on-kashs.html"> Three-card Monte</a> scheme of the Bush Republicans.  This was Max’s point <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001046.html">here</a>.  But does David Altig implicitly support this massive transfer of wealth when he writes <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/01/kling_and_sawic.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gap between payroll tax receipts and benefits is presently scheduled for 2018, not 2042</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to George and Nell.  Suppose Nell wishes to marry George.  Arnold’s point seems to be that such a marriage drags her bank account into George’s financial irresponsibility.  But does it?  The analogy to Al Gore’s “lockbox” would be a prenuptial stipulating that George could not tap Nell’s back account to pay off his credit cards and requiring George to end his financial irresponsibility.  This might work out if George were President George Washington, but then the current President is named George W. Bush.<br /></p>

                                <p>But I have resigned from the Diane Feinstein fan club.  I watched my senior Senator introduce Dr. Rice this morning.  Now I’m all for bipartisan support for good foreign policy and a strong national defense but Senator Feinstein’s gushing over Dr. Rice went beyond credibility.  But then Senator Boxer made me proud I voted for her. How you ask?  Check <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/18/rice.confirmation/index.html">this</a> out:</p>
<blockquote><p>California Sen. Barbara Boxer questioned Rice aggressively before the panel broke for lunch, suggesting that Rice&#8217;s loyalty to Bush and her mission to defend the war in Iraq &#8220;overwhelmed your respect for the truth.&#8221; Rice bristled, saying that &#8220;I have to say that I have never, ever, lost respect for the truth in the service of anything,&#8221; She later told Boxer, &#8220;I really hope that you will refrain from impugning my integrity.&#8221; Boxer pointed out what she said were inconsistencies in Rice&#8217;s statements about the imminent threat of nuclear weapons in Iraq. &#8220;This is a pattern here of what I see from you,&#8221; Boxer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very troubling. &#8230; It&#8217;s hard for me to let go of this war because people are still dying.&#8221; She said Rice has not acknowledged those deaths, has not laid out an exit strategy for Iraq and has been unwilling to admit mistakes &#8212; including going to war over weapons of mass destruction found later not to exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, Boxer did not impugn Dr. Rice’s credibility as Rice has none.  More from Dr. Rice: </p>
<blockquote><p>The time for diplomacy is now.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Thank goodness as we have had a complete lack of diplomacy during Bush’s first term.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/18/news/economy/growth.reut/index.htm">further confirmation</a> that influential market participants don&#8217;t expect any serious trouble for the US economy this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>LONDON (Reuters) &#8211; Interest rates will continue rising steadily this year, with tightening also expected in Canada and &#8212; in the final months of 2005 &#8212; in the euro zone, a Reuters poll of more than 150 economists showed Tuesday. </p>
<p>&#8230;The median forecasts in the poll, taken last week, showed the Fed funds rate adding another 150 basis points to end the year at 3.75 percent and rise further to 4.25 percent by the end of 2006. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank &#8212; whose 2 percent refi rate was overtaken by Fed funds in December &#8212; was seen starting to play catch-up towards the end of the year, but slowly&#8230; The mid-range forecasts showed the ECB increasing rates to 2.25 percent by the end of the year and to 2.75 percent by September 2006 as domestic demand finally picks up.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests that the median economist expects economic growth in the US to continue to be substantially faster than growth in the euro zone, for the fourth year in a row. </p>
<p>One important side effect of this will be to worsen the US&#8217;s current account deficit.  When the US grows faster than the EU, the US&#8217;s trade imbalance tends to worsen, as the chart below suggests.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/us_eu.jpg"></p>
<p>So market participants think that the US will enjoy healthy growth this year, interest rates will rise, and the US trade imbalance (and implied borrowing needs) will continue to grow, for at least the next year or two.</p>
<p>One last interesting finding in the survey regards Japan:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Japan, an economic slowdown expected this year will probably ensure the Bank of Japan sticks to its zero interest rate policy for some time. </p>
<p>&#8220;For the absolute foreseeable future, we expect no change in the zero interest rate policy,&#8221; said Baader at Lehman Brothers. </p>
<p>&#8220;We would see (hikes in Japan) if we foresaw an end to deflation and if we thought that Japanese growth was going to be stronger. (But) we actually look &#8212; out of the big regions &#8212; for by far the most pronounced slowdown to take place in Japan, in 2005 versus 2004.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Will their deflation ever end?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The White House and its loyal talking heads want us to believe two things: (1) the Social Security Trust Fund is short $10 trillion; and (2) privatization is a free lunch that will create $10 trillion out of thin air.  Some of their claims are so absurd, all I can think of are certain childhood cartoon characters such as J. Wellington Wimpy who would say &#8220;I&#8217;d gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&#8221;.  Now don’t get me wrong as I love hamburgers but Wimpy annoyed me.  Imagine a small child trying to mouth “time value of money”.  </p>
<p>I thought of Wimpy as I read this <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20030915.shtml">Robert Novak oped</a> where  Novak finally admitted there is no free lunch (something free-lunch supply-side Lawrence Kudlow gets him to claim quite often) but then writes this very odd statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the Social Security Administration&#8217;s actuaries, transition costs of DeMint&#8217;s plan would be $8.2 trillion over the next 75 years. But the same source estimates the 75-year-cost in higher taxes at $26.1 trillion if nothing is done. That&#8217;s how DeMint claims his plan will save taxpayers $17.9 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow – which restaurant will pay me $26.10 in change if I purchase lunch for $8.20?  I checked NRO to see if Kudlow gave him this statistic and it seems Lawrence is not even touching this issue.  Stephen Moore’s oped was not placed at NRO but <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=5943">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Studies show that for the average young worker now entering the job market, the rate of return on this account would average, even conservatively estimated, between 4% and 6% per year&#8211;that&#8217;s is versus the less than 2% that Social Security returns…George Bush deserves to be applauded for having an adult conversation with the American public about the severe funding crisis in Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yes, the Trust Fund is near bankruptcy and we have a free lunch – but no $26 billion claim.  NRO is publishing Luskin opeds, which is the only downside to the return of Paul Krugman to the New York Times.  The closest thing to Novak’s $26 million from Donald “imminent crisis” Luskin that I found was <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/kts200412090830.asp">this</a> claim that the Congressional Budget Office is claiming a Social Security deficit equal to 2% of GDP:</p>
<blockquote><p>the fact that this very calculation means, even with new revenues of 0.54 percent of GDP injected into the system, that the system will end up exhausted: “at the end of the 100 years, the balance would be large enough to authorize paying one year’s worth of benefits.” After that, the report projects there will be a mismatch between revenues and expenditures of more than 2 percent of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luskin has to go to the 22nd century to find his imminent crisis?  And we thought the neocons were overstating the dangers of Saddam Hussein!  </p>
<p>This New York Times article this weekend by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html?adxnnl=1&#038;oref=login&#038;adxnnlx=1105906703-q3vXLPFXujICqd0RcVRZAw&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;position=">Roger Lowenstein</a> is getting a lot of well deserved praise.  Roger has discovered Novak’s source for the $26 trillion claim and done the kind of reporting Novak refuses to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cato, a libertarian policy center founded in the late 1970&#8217;s, has been arguing for 25 years that Social Security is on the verge of crisis. In a recent position paper, Tanner wrote that Social Security faces a horrendous unfinanced liability of $26 trillion over 75 years. In a footnote, he cited the 2003 trustees&#8217; annual report. Actually, the trustees&#8217; intermediate projection is for a deficit, over 75 years, of $3.7 trillion. Though that is a lot of money, it could be covered by an immediate surcharge to the payroll tax of less than two percentage points, or by various combinations of tax hikes and benefit cuts, each of them quite manageable. But $26 trillion is too big a hole to fix. When I asked Tanner about the footnote, he admitted that the trustees didn&#8217;t actually say $26 trillion; Tanner derived the figure by counting the cash-flow deficits that the trustees project from 2019 on out. In other words, he ignores the next 15 years or so, during which time Social Security will be running a surplus. And he assumes that the assets in the trust fund, which should be accruing interest into the 2040&#8217;s, won&#8217;t exist, either. Tanner counts only the bad years and only the bad numbers. Another doomsayer, former Republican Representative John Kasich, pegged the Social Security deficit at $120 trillion in a recent op-ed &#8212; some 32 times the agency&#8217;s figure. (Kasich toted up annual deficits in nominal &#8212; not inflation-adjusted &#8212; dollars for every year through 2080, by which time a hamburger could cost $40.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hamburgers again!  I’m getting hungry and Fatburgers is just down the road.  But darn, I’m out of cash and the ATM is broke.  Wait, the manager is named Mike Tanner and he loves to read Novak’s columns.  Idea!  I’ll sign this piece of paper as an IOU for $10 dated 12/31/2100.  Maybe Mike will give me two hamburgers and enough change to buy a beer on the way home – assuming he really believes this Novakian finance.<br /></p>

<p>Memo to the Rush Limbaugh wannabes who only think they know the NFL: both McNabb and Vick contribute more to their teams than QB ratings.  Both are true leaders of what are truly TEAMS.  OK, I’d rather have that Colts offense but both of these NFC defenses can make things happen even as fast as a Michael Vick scrabble. </p>
<p>Bottom line: it should be as much fun in Philadelphia next Sunday as it was in the Georgia Dome last night.  But hopefully, it will be the visiting team having the most fun this time.<br /></p>

<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8212; A forthcoming request for additional funds to continue waging war in Iraq will not begin to address the &#8220;hidden cost&#8221; of the conflict, according to Pentagon officials and other government authorities who say that tens of billions of dollars more will eventually be needed to repair or replace heavily used equipment and to compensate for the wear and tear on members of the armed services.</p>
<p>The Pentagon next month plans to ask Congress for up to $100 billion in supplemental funds to pay for the ongoing combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing the total budgeted so far to well over $200 billion. But military officers say the administration&#8217;s estimates do not include the investment that will be necessary to fix what they say they fear is becoming a broken ground force.</p>
<p>[snip] &#8230; If the war were to end today, according to a preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that was described by officials who have been briefed on it, the Army would still need at least $20 billion more than budgeted over the next three years just to be at the same level of preparedness as before the war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this administration has a long history of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/02/costs-and-benefits-sound-policy.html">systematically understating the costs</a> of its policies. (Thanks to reader Spencer for the tip.)</p>

                                <p>Was President Bush technically correct when he declared the Social Security Trust Fund (SSTF) bankrupt?  In one corner, we have <a href="http://www.deadparrots.net/archives/social_security/0501bush_v_the_facts.html">Victor</a> and <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/01/white-house-on-social-security.html#comments">Andrew Samwick</a> who defend Bush’s use of this term.  In the other corner, we have <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001050.html">Max Sawicky</a> warning Professor Samwick about his Kool-Aid and <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/01/so_does_the_pre.html">Brad Setser</a> extending the definitions to the discussion over the current account deficit.  </p>
<p>When Thomas Sargent a generation ago was criticizing Reagan’s fiscal policy, he was careful to say that we were on the path to bankruptcy as he noted solvency could be maintained if policy makers had the courage to eventually cut spending or raise taxes.  We had baby steps in that direction from CEO Reagan, more significant steps from CEO Bush41, and even more significant steps from CEO Clinton.  Even though the Federal debt to GDP ratio doubled from one-third to two-thirds over the 1981 to 1996 period, these steps eventually got the path of the debt to GDP ratio to decline for the next 5 years.  Then came CEO Bush43 – more on that later.</p>
<p>As far as the SSTF historical income statements and balance sheets, <a href="http://%20angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/01/14th-amendment.html">AB</a> provides the details as to how SSTF’s surpluses have amassed $1.6 trillion in reserves.  What did <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/01/social_security.html">Brad S.</a> say again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t forget that the government &#8212; the non social security part &#8212; has expenditures well in excess of revenues RIGHT NOW. Dick Cheney apparently thinks cash flow deficits that have to be financed by issuing tons of debt don&#8217;t matter, but cash flow deficits than can be financed by drawing on the interest from your stock of existing assets are a real problem &#8230; interesting financial logic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translating Sargent’s wisdom into corporate finance analogies so our MBA President can follow, think of two companies: SSTF and GF (General Fund).  Suppose SSTF signs 15-year renewable contracts with its suppliers and its customers.  The contract through 2020 will insure its $1.6 trillion reserve grows to $8 trillion.  The renewals for the next 15 increments can have modest changes from the current pay-outs and pay-ins but even if we renew on current terms, these reserves will be sufficient until rounds 4 and 5 (the period from 2051 to 2080) begin.  When the SSTF bankruptcy crowd says there is some $10 trillion unfunded liability, what they mean is there is some estimate of expected future cash flows that generates this figure.  Now anyone with a DCF spreadsheet can play with the cash flow assumptions to make Microsoft look bankrupt and make Enron look very valuable – but then the assumptions would have to be called into question.  Small modifications in the contracts for rounds 2 through 5 will make SSTF solvent.</p>
<p>But let’s look at GF in the following way.  By the end of the year, it will have $8 trillion in debt.  Let GF earn commission income that is currently equal to 11% of GDP, while its operating expenses are 14% of GDP.  On top of having operating losses equal to 3% of GDP, its interest expense is about 3% of GDP.  And CEO Bush43 has packed the Board of Directors (Congress) with like-minded people who refuse to increase the commission rate and have no clue how to lower operating expenses.  </p>
<p>I seriously doubt Victor and Professor Samwick would short-sell SSTF to buy lots of GF stock as that would have been like short-selling Microsoft in the 1990’s and investing in Enron during the summer of 2001.  But if you know anyone who buys into the Dick Cheney school of finance, I have some Delta Airlines stock they can pick up for $15 a share.<br /></p>

                                <p>The 14th amendment was the linchpin of civil rights, though the process was painfully slow. Upon <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page43.htm">passage in 1868</a> it overturned the <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/21.htm">abhorrent Dred Scott verdict</a>, which held that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;. we [the Supreme Court of the United States of America] have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, upon a different point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution. The right to traffic in it, like an ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guaranteed to the citizens of the United States, in every state that might desire it, for twenty years. And the government in express terms is pledged to protect it in all future time if the slave escapes from his owner. That is done in plain words &#8212; too plain to be misunderstood. &#8230;neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his family, were made free by being carried into this territory; even if they had been carried there by the owner with the intention of becoming a permanent resident. </p></blockquote>
<p>But, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000159.html">tipped off by Brad D.</a>, I am reminded that the 14th amendment also <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment14/">contains a 4th section</a> [emphases mine]:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Section 4.<br />
<br />The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.<br />

<p> So, yes, the trust fund is real. The general fund, financed by income taxes (cut significantly over the last 4 years), owes a lot of money (<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/assets.html">more than $1.6 trillion</a>) to the trust find, which was and is financed by payroll taxes (increased significantly in the early 1980s). As it turns out, that debt of more than $1.6 trillion &#8220;shall not be questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seen anyone questioning it lately?</p>

<li>Lost: Still a good show, but lost a bit of its edge. Discuss in comments.</p>
</li>
<li>Committed: In the running for worst sitcom in a generation. I&#8217;ve long enjoyed Heather Havrilesky&#8217;s columns, but how could she <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/review/2005/01/10/i_like/index.html">like this show</a>? A woman likes tea, in <a href="http://www.englishteastore.com/teabain.html">balls</a>. That of course gives the male protagonist the chance to say &#8220;little balls&#8221; many times. Hilarity does not ensue. And that was the funny part.
</li>
<li>Law and Order: I&#8217;ve liked this show, and even its spin offs, for a long time, and they&#8217;re still entertaining. Plus, I&#8217;ve always liked Jerry &#8220;Nobody puts Baby in the corner&#8221; Orbach, whose <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/02/entertainment/main658773.shtml">unfortunate passing last week</a> I meant to note (in addition to enjoying his acting, I shared Jerry&#8217;s enthusiasm for pool.)
</li>
<li>When does season 2 of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/?ntrack_para1=leftnav_category0_show3">Deadwood</a> start? More generally, why is everything HBO airs on Sunday night so far and away better than everything else on TV?<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, when you spend this much time pondering policy and politics as they exist right now, you need a distraction &#8212; sometimes many of them.</p>
<p>Now for the &#8220;less so&#8221; part.(*) Here&#8217;s the life expectancy of an American, conditional on reaching age 65:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ConditionalLE.jpg"></p>
<p>While overall life expectancy has gone up a lot, people who reach retirement age now live only 2 years longer on average than those who turned 65 thirty-five years ago. See <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_01_09_atrios_archive.html#110558656169500959">Atrios for a bit of context</a> on why this distinction is important. VoxBaby has what looks like counter-arguments, though I haven&#8217;t yet had time to really read <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/01/white-house-on-social-security.html">the lengthy post</a>.</p>
