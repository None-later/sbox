                                <p>Just as I thought the Clown Show at the National Review could not get funnier, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200501110842.asp">Luskin</a> exceeds expectations:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Social Security crisis begins to materialize in just 5 years…Here are the facts. You decide whether they amount to a “crisis.”… he surplus will keep getting bigger and bigger through 2008, when it will reach $108 billion….But in 2009, just 5 years from now, the surplus will start to shrink. In 2009 it will fall to $103.7 billion, and in that year the federal government will have to go to the capital markets to raise $4.3 billion that it didn’t have to raise the year before. That’s not a lot of money in the grand governmental scheme of things. But it’s an important turning point for Social Security — it’s the year the crisis begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that revenues will exceed expenditures for another decade and that interest income will exceed the difference between expenditures and revenues after that.  Never mind the fact that the Trust Fund will have reserves sufficient to last until 2052, the system goes bankrupt as soon as the surplus hits its peak.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Appendix:</strong> President Bush says the Trust Fund will be “flat broke” circa 2042 when it is projected (pessimistic scenario) to have zero reserves (R).  Actually, the system will still have the continuing payroll contributions so “flat broke” is a little loose.  But Bush’s definition of the crisis date seems to be when the first derivative of R turns negative even that R will be close to $8 trillion at that point (actually the first derivative of R is projected to still be positive even after 2018).  So Luskin’s definition of the crisis date is when the second derivative of R flips from positive to negative.  Huh?<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>OK, I never met Ida May Fuller but the fellow who wrote <a href="http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/ss/wsj.2000-07-12.htm">this WSJ oped</a> in July 2000 claims to be a friend of hers.  I metion  this in light of the latest from <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/010505G.html">James Glassman</a> (see the <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000137.html">comment</a> from Brad DeLong).  </p>
<p>It would seem that Glassman continues in a long line of those who declare Social Security to be a Ponzi Scheme using Ida’s good name to do so (do they even know what Ponzi’s scheme was).  This PonziSquad seems a bit mixed-up as to what Ida paid in contributions ($25 or $44) and what she got out in undiscounted cash flows ($21,000 or $23,000).  While they don’t say what the timing of these cash flows were, they know somehow magically what the return on investment was.  </p>
<p>OK, Ida did well – no doubt.  But then she lived past her 100th birthday, which is certainly longer than the “life expectancy of a newborn” born in 1874.  OK, Glassman’s life expectancy concept is the wrong one, but the life expectancy of those who retired at age 65 in 1935 was not to live to 100.   If Glassman does not get the point here, have him call <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/social-security-part-i-insurance-and.html">Angrybear</a>.</p>
<p>Now it is appropriate to say that the first cohort got a good deal, but then that has been long recognized by economists who would also note that the Reagan-Greenspan Social Security Commission raised the payroll contribution 20 years ago so my generation would actually prefund our retirements with those Social Security surpluses that the Glassman crowd wish to steal for income tax cuts.  So what does the first cohort have to do with the 2005 debate?  Unless Glassman can find a time machine and make a young Ida circa 1900 pay more into the system.  Dear sweet Ida has long departed so trying to get her to pay more into the system is not a solution to the Social Security crisis that does not exist.<br /></p>

                                <p>After weeks of lean-to-the-right panels and rather worthless discussions, <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6805000">Russert</a> invites Al Hunt, Katty Kay, Andrea Mitchell, and Byron York to discuss various issues.  OK, <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> is right that the Social Security discussion was awful.  But the Iraq discussion was of interest:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. HUNT:  You also see, Tim, I think there is the beginnings of a huge battle within the conservative movement on the GOP side.  I mean, I there are&#8211;I hear more anti-neocon sentiments coming from conservative Republicans these days, and I think that there is a lot of&#8211;you know, what did you get us into?  You know, who did this to us, even as we&#8217;re approaching elections three weeks from now.<br />
<br />MR. RUSSERT:  Conservative columnist George Will has expressed reservations. The founder of The National Review, William F. Buckley, has indicated some real concerns about the war in Iraq, Byron.<br />
<br />MR. YORK:  He has basically said that if we knew then what we know now, that perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t have been worth doing…<br />
<br />MS. KAY:  They didn&#8217;t have the major degree of insurgency in Afghanistan that you have now, and you also didn&#8217;t have a country that is so clearly split between Sunni, Kurd and Shia.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Not to defend Mr. York (National Review), but Ms. Kay forgets that there were many more than three factions of War Lords in Afghanistan.  But what do they know over at the National Review now about Iraq that they did not know three months ago?  So why was his crew supporting President Bush’s 3/19/2003 decision back then?  </p>
<p>But the queen of NRO hacks remains Kate O-Beirne who routinely poisons the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0501/08/cg.01.html">Capital Gang</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SHIELDS: Kate, are you equally unimpressed as Bob is by Alberto Gonzales?<br />
<br />O&#8217;BEIRNE: You know what I&#8217;m impressed by? The Democrats&#8217; willingness to run the risk of running under a banner of prisoner rights for terrorists.</p></blockquote>
<p>She did not just insult Democrats but also the entire country.  Maybe she was not listening earlier in the show when Al Hunt praised a couple of GOP Senators:</p>
<blockquote><p>HUNT: But I think his answers this week on the torture memos were not only disappointing, but you wonder if he gets it. As Republican senator Lindsey Graham pointed out &#8211; and I think there are POWs like &#8211; ex-POWs, rather, like John McCain who agree &#8211; Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have really been &#8211; they&#8217;ve hurt us. They&#8217;ve been really &#8211; it&#8217;s not only wrong, they&#8217;ve been terribly injurious. And I think it&#8217;s clear that those memos and some other high-level decisions set that in motion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Graham and McCain for prisoner rights for terrorists? But Kate – not every prisoner in Abu Ghraib was a terrorist.<br /></p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000133.html">ridicules</a> the latest cheerleading from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200501071537.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>. It was this paragraph that caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent study by the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates that only 98,000 new jobs per month are required to keep unemployment under control. The reason? Labor-force participation has declined somewhat as more students remain in school, more workers take early retirement, and more moms stay home to have kids and attend to child care.</p></blockquote>
<p>What study you ask (why can’t the NRO cite things properly)?  <em>Employment Growth and Labor Force Participation: How Many Jobs are Enough? </em>by Julie L. Hotchkiss can be found <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=B2793305-CF9B-64C1-13B6F8CEA41A2C22&#038;method=display">here</a>. Too bad Larry did not read it carefully as Julie knows what Brad noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>In February 2003, the White House Council of Economic Advisors predicted that the administration&#8217;s tax cuts would contribute to an average monthly gain in jobs of 300,000. This figure was quickly picked up by the popular press and touted as a reasonable and necessary goal for the U.S. economy…Between January 2000 and August 2004, the U.S. economy has added 17,000 jobs per month on average. The Bush administration believed that its tax cuts would generate enough economic stimulus to create more than enough jobs to overcome these historical tendencies and to lower unemployment…the projected growth in employment was overly optimistic. </p></blockquote>
<p>But Larry misrepresents what this paper was doing.  Its purpose was to explain how employment growth could be weak and yet the unemployment rate could decline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between June 2003 and August 2004 the economy has created an average of only 107,000 jobs per month, which, based on the above calculations should have caused the unemployment rate to rise. The apparent paradox is that over this same time period (June 2003 to August 2004) the unemployment rate (depicted in Figure 2) has declined steadily: Paradox resolved: labor force participation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Julie does note the popular stories as to why the participation rate declined such as this one Larry forgot to mention:</p>
<blockquote><p>The negative relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate is well-known. In order to be counted as unemployed, one has to be actively searching for employment. The number of people unemployed, then, can decline if the unemployed transition into employment, or if the unemployed stop looking for work. In this second case, the resulting decline in the unemployment rate is not accompanied by an increase in employment, but, rather, only a decline in the total labor force. </p></blockquote>
<p>She also notes reasons why people might voluntarily leave the labor force including:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230; family responsibilities (such as child care difficulties), being in school, being in poor health, &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Early retirement was briefly mentioned but she also noted that some of the Social Security proposals to delay the retirement date would tend to increase the labor force participation rate.  </p>
<p>But Larry did not tell us that.  Did he really read this article?<br /></p>

                                <p>When I err, I err.  I was so frustrated yesterday with the excuse mongering re the White House bribing Armstrong Williams and with the focus on the secondary issue – that being Williams’s unethical behavior, I went after Jonah Goldberg (and misspelled his name to boot).  Readers of the Angrybear let me off too easy IMHO as Goldberg went after the primary issue – the abuse of taxpayer funds.  OK, he was wrong IMHO to drag Clinton’s name into this, but I was wrong not to read his piece more carefully.  So hat tip to Jonah for getting this right – and one big apology. </p>
<p>My error below:</p>
<p>So NRO’s Cornerites have decided to comment on the Armstrong affair.  Johan Goldberg<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_01_02_corner-archive.asp#049714">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean come on. Why do this? Did someone need an operation? Unless some major facts are being left out this just dumb. It looks bad because it is bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks bad?  Yes, Johan has no ethical standards at all.  But then Johan does this update:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the Clinton Administration had been paying off liberal pundits to promote his policies we would have gone batty, and rightly so.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if Clinton did it – it’d be unethical, but when Bush did it, it only looks bad?  I see.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>The Bush administration paid a prominent commentator to promote the No Child Left Behind schools law to fellow blacks and to give the education secretary media time, records show…The GAO has twice ruled that the Bush administration&#8217;s use of prepackaged videos &#8211; to promote federal drug policy and a new Medicare law &#8211; is &#8220;covert propaganda&#8221; because the videos do not make clear to the public that the government produced the promotional news.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the Bush Administration has cross this line before.  A reader of <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_02.php#004361">Josh Marshall’s blog</a> asks the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Question: who else has been on the payroll? They sank a quarter of a million into one not so prominent commentator to push a single issue &#8211; not even one where they really needed help &#8211; and they never greased anyone else? Not so credible.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The latest <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">employment report</a> shows payroll employment rose last month by 157 thousand to close 2004 at 132,266,000.  This figure is slightly less than the 132,441,000 reported for December 2000.  The report also shows the unemployment rate staying at 5.4%.  It seems that noisy household survey show a 137,000 decline in reported employment but the labor force participation rate retreated to 66.0%.  This rate was 67.0% in December 2000.  BLS also reports that the employment-population ratio was 62.4% where it has hovered for the past year.  In December 2000, the employment-population ratio was 64.4%.  </p>
<p>Bottom line is that employment growth for 2004 was just enough to keep pace with population growth and not enough to reverse the lackluster performance for the prior three years.  A week ago as we were all preparing for our New Year’s celebrations, Lawrence Kudlow must have started on the Korbel a bit earlier as he wrote <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200412300923.asp">this NRO oped</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most comprehensive measure of economic health — inflation-adjusted gross domestic product — has been trending steadily around 4 percent for the last two years. This is half a percent above the nation&#8217;s 3.5 percent long-run growth trend. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate — which used to be the key election-year labor-market indicator — moved down from 6.3 percent to 5.4 percent, indicating strong U.S. work conditions. Then there’s the 2 percent inflation trend, a stat never mentioned during the campaign but a long stone’s throw from Jimmy Carter’s 15 percent rate of price increases. Big media let Kerry get away with murder as he obsessed over non-farm payroll jobs, which were slow to recover but have in fact expanded by over 2 million in the past eighteen months. Nonetheless, the other major jobs report — the household survey — went virtually unreported. The household measure shows a 2.5 million jobs gain during Bush’s first term and a whopping 4.2 million increase since the end of the 2001 recession. It’s a real measure, too: It gives us the unemployment rate. It also does not triple-count job gains or losses, as is the case with the payroll survey, while it does include self-employed workers and independent contractors, key parts of our new Internet-based information economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>As far as the household survey being a real measure, I wish Larry would read the footnotes noting that one should not compare across years given the way this survey data is compiled.  As far as the unemployment rate – two facts Larry seems to omit: (1) the 5.4% is higher than the 3.9% just before Bush took office; and (2) the drop in the labor force participation rate means that the employment-population ratio fell by more than the unemployment rate increased.  And yes, real GDP growth has been slightly above this 3.5% long-run trend for the last couple of years but couldn’t Larry tell NRO readers that over the entire four year period, real GDP growth has averaged only 2.5%?  What is Larry trying to tell his readers?  That the 2003 tax cut worked wonders?  But he forgets to mention that 2001 tax cut, which he predicted would lead to incredible economic growth.<br /></p>

<br />
<blockquote>Seeking to build support among black families for its education reform law, the Bush administration paid a prominent black pundit $240,000 to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television show and to urge other black journalists to do the same.</p>
<p>The campaign, part of an effort to promote No Child Left Behind, required commentator Armstrong Williams &#8220;to regularly comment on NCLB during the course of his broadcasts,&#8221; and to interview Education Secretary Rod Paige for TV and radio spots that aired during the show in 2004.</p>
<p>Williams said Thursday he understands that critics could find the arrangement unethical, but &#8220;I wanted to do it because it&#8217;s something I believe in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that when he refers to &#8220;something I believe in,&#8221; Williams means sucking $240,000 off the government&#8217;s teat, not NCLB. After all, if he liked NCLB so much, there would be no need to pay him to shill for it.</p>
<p>I wonder who paid him, and how much, for <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-12-09-williams_x.htm">this piece of crap</a>?</p>

                                <p>Since replacing Gray Davis as governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger has adopted the George W. Bush approach to balancing budgets: keep tax rates from rising, talk about spending cuts but do nothing, and use a lot of misleading rhetoric to keep the press at bay.  So he gives a speech yesterday and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/05/schwarzenegger.speech.ap/index.html">here</a>  is how AP reports it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called a special session of the Legislature on Wednesday to tackle a list of proposals aimed at closing an $8.1 billion deficit, improving education and reforming state government…The governor said the session would focus on his proposals to cut state spending if its grows beyond incoming revenues, limit the cost of pensions paid to the state&#8217;s public employees, pay teachers based on merit instead of tenure and change how California&#8217;s legislative and congressional districts are drawn…Missing from his speech, however, were details of how Schwarzenegger plans to fix a $8.1 billion budget deficit next year without raising taxes. Last year, an estimated $17 billion deficit was closed by spending cuts mixed with more than $7 billion in loans, one-time solutions and accounting gimmicks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see.  We’ll improve education as we reduce the deficit?  No details WHERE the governor wishes to reduce spending – except perhaps taking away retirement benefits.  But this notion that borrowing reduces a deficit is just bad reporting.  Now <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001037.html">where</a> else have we heard this line?<br /></p>

                                <p>Peter Wehner’s memo on Social Security can be found <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000119.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There are two substantive points as far as I can see.  The first:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, we&#8217;re going to take a very close look at changing the way benefits are calculated. As you probably know, under current law benefits are calculated by a &#8220;wage index&#8221; &#8212; but because wages grow faster than inflation, so do Social Security benefits. If we don&#8217;t address this aspect of the current system, we&#8217;ll face serious economic risks. It&#8217;s worth noting that wage indexation was not part of the original design of Social Security. The current method of wage indexation was created in 1977, under (you guessed it) the Carter Administration. Wage indexation makes it impossible to &#8220;grow our way&#8221; out of the Social Security problem. If the economy grows faster and wages rise, this produces more tax revenue. But the faster wage growth also means that we owe more in Social Security benefits. This has produced a never-ending cycle of higher tax burdens, even during periods of robust economic growth. It is the classic case of the dog chasing his tail around the tree; he can run faster and faster, and never make any progress…Here&#8217;s a startling fact: under current law, an average retiree in 2050 would be scheduled to receive close to 40 percent more (in real terms) in benefits than an average retiree today &#8212; and yet there are no mechanisms in place to produce the revenue to pay out those benefits. No one on this planet can tell you why a 25-year-old person today is entitled to a 40 percent increase in Social Security benefits (in real terms) compared to what a person retiring today receives.  </p></blockquote>
<p>My hat tip is to KHarris because KH had the first blog comment that at least I saw directed at this point.  KH is a regular visitor to both Angrybear and Brad DeLong’s webcite and has some excellent comments.  KH noted Little Nell (Max Sawicky’s name for someone born in 2000) would pay more in payroll taxes than yours truly but would get no more in retirement benefits.  Glad to see Peter is admitting that the Bush plan addresses this alleged fiscal crisis (which is in the General Fund) by imposing more taxes on Little Nell but giving less benefits than someone who just retired.  </p>
<p>Wehner’s other point seems to be that there is no free lunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may know that there is a small number of conservatives who prefer to push only for investment accounts and make no effort to adjust benefits &#8212; therefore making no effort to address this fundamental structural problem. In my judgment, that&#8217;s a bad idea. We simply cannot solve the Social Security problem with Personal Retirement Accounts alone. If the goal is permanent solvency and sustainability &#8212; as we believe it should be &#8211;then Personal Retirements Accounts, for all their virtues, are insufficient to that task…If we duck our duty, it can have serious short-term economic consequences. Here&#8217;s why. If we borrow $1-2 trillion to cover transition costs for personal savings accounts and make no changes to wage indexing, we will have borrowed trillions and will still confront more than $10 trillion in unfunded liabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, I agree.  So why is the GOP trying to tell us there is a free lunch?<br /></p>
