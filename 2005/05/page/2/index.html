<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; After hours of heated exchanges, the Senate failed Thursday evening to close off debate on President Bush&#8217;s nomination of John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations … Two key Democratic senators &#8211; Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Joe Biden of Delaware &#8211; asked their Democratic colleagues Thursday to vote against closing the debate. The two said they wanted more time for the Bush administration to turn over requested documents relating to Syria and to 10 instances of communications intercepted by the National Security Agency. The senators said Bolton had once sought those intercepts as the undersecretary of state for arms control.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the White House wants a vote on the Bolton nomination, why not comply with this request?  What is the White House hiding?</p>

<blockquote><p>Some might say that any harm brought on less politically connected U.S. business sectors will be made up for by companies allegedly made more competitive by attempts to weaken China. But these people will have not thought through to stage three: China does import U.S. goods &#8211; over $34 billion in 2004. A weakened China will necessarily import less. </p></blockquote>
<p>Chinese consumers will likely buy more products but at lower relative prices – so this statement is saying that Tamny knows that the elasticity of demand is less than unity.  </p>
<p>His “stage two” is even more bizarre:</p>
<blockquote><p>The unseen second stage that’s apparently being ignored by Treasury is that material imports are the major cost-factor for Chinese goods. If the yuan strengthens, China’s material costs will drop. Wages are a smaller component of the cost of Chinese goods, but a stronger yuan will give Chinese workers a real rise in income, and could potentially lead to lower nominal wages as they adjust to the revalued unit of account.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Chinese wages still rise in real terms, which implies that their advantage in terms of value-added declines.</p>

<blockquote><p>HOUSTON (Reuters) &#8211; Thousands of former Enron Corp. employees will share $85 million in insurance proceeds to compensate for pensions lost when the energy giant collapsed into bankruptcy, a federal judge ruled this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the incredibly arrogant part is:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon formally approved the settlement between Enron&#8217;s insurers and about 20,000 former employees Tuesday despite opposition from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling. The two former executives, who will face criminal trial in January 2006 on charges including conspiracy and fraud at the company, had argued the funds came from Enron&#8217;s corporate insurance policies that were to be used to help pay for their legal defense. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Peronet Despeignes’s interview with <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,1064384-1,00.html">Greg Mankiw</a> was noted by <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/mankiw-interview-in-fortune-magazine.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/greg_mankiw_spe.html">Tyler Cowen</a> and was critiqued in part by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/05/wait_a_minute_h.html">Brad DeLong</a>.  I wish to take on a couple of comments regarding fiscal policy.  The first relates to:</p>
<blockquote><p>The policy process worked extremely well. It&#8217;s not like one person sits there—like Karl Rove sits off all by himself making economic policy, or Dick Cheney sits all by himself making economic policy …  Karl Rove is a very reasonable guy. I was absolutely delighted that he got the job as deputy chief of staff. He knows his stuff. Some political folks see policy as a way of getting political things accomplished. That&#8217;s not Karl Rove. He&#8217;s motivated a lot by good policy … I didn’t disagree with the thrust of fiscal policy. It’s a textbook prescription that it’s an appropriate time to run budget deficits in times of war and recession. President Bush inherited the conditions that were driving us into a recession and the war on terror, so I think running a deficit was an appropriate time to run, so I thought running a budget deficit over the past couple years was a very reasonable policy response.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m find it hard to accept the notion that any bright economist – whether Glenn Hubbard or Greg Mankiw – agreed with the mess known as Bush’s fiscal policy.  Let’s start with the 2001 tax cut, which was originally designed by Lawrence Lindsey in 1999 when the economy was near full employment.  Lindsey may have claimed it was “perfectly timed” in 2001 but it was poorly designed regardless of what the policy objective might have been.  Lindsey claimed the tax “cuts” – which were really tax deferrals given there was no offsetting reduction in government spending – were designed to make the tax code more equitable.  Now if young blue collar workers pay too little in taxes with rich elderly types paying too much, I can see this argument.  While Bush was claiming we should “give people their money back” so they can consume more – Hubbard’s rational for fiscal policy reform has always been to increase savings (less consumption).  But we should concede Mankiw’s point that we needed some stimulus in 2001, which is where the poorly designed part comes in.  Consider Mankiw’s <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/papers/aea1.pdf">Savers-Spenders</a> Model of Fiscal Policy where lower income households are liquidity constrained.  If aggregate demand stimulus was the goal, passing delayed tax rate cuts focused on high income individuals was precisely the wrong approach.  </p>
<p>By October 2001, the Senate moderates in both parties decided the right strategy would be to have short-term fiscal stimulus with long-term fiscal restraint, which is often referred to as Rubinomics.  This strategy would both allow for both a more effective aggregate demand stimulus and more long-term savings and investment, which would have brought together Mankiw’s goal of restoring full employment and Hubbard’s goal of higher long-term growth.  Alas – the political operatives in the White House made sure this sensible agenda of the Senate moderates would not be enacted.</p>
<p>In fact, none of Bush’s fiscal agenda makes economic sense unless one seriously believes that this Administration is pursuing a small government strategy, which would require massive reductions in government spending.  Mankiw continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at discretionary spending, you see very significant spending restraint. But I think the issue longer term, over a five-, ten- or 20-year horizon, the big issue is not discretionary spending, but entitlements.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry but I see not only defense spending rising but also increases in Federal nondefense spending.  I do agree that the projected rise in entitlement spending is a serious issue, but then part of this projected increase comes from the oversized prescription drug benefit that the White House pushed through Congress.  </p>
<p>Let’s recall the silly reason why <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/moore/moore022803b.asp">Stephen Moore</a> opposed Mankiw being appointed to the CEA:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mankiw refers to Ronald Reagan’s supply-side advisers as &#8220;charlatans and cranks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mankiw’s criticism of Reagan’s fiscal irresponsibility was first-rate.  Yet, he cannot bring himself to do the same in regards George W. Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility.  The only way that the CEA would have agreed to Bush’s fiscal policy would have been for it to be staffed by Lawrence Kudlow, Donald Luskin, and Tom Nugent.  Bush, however, staffed the CEA with some very talented economists – but alas apparently refused to listen to their wise counsel.</p>

                                <p>Let’s compare two stories.  One seems to have Bush admitting he’s a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/24/social.security/index.html">divider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fully recognize some in Washington, you know, don&#8217;t particularly want to address this issue,&#8221; Bush said in an auditorium at Greece Athena Middle and High School. I recognize some of them say, `Well, this is, this is a partisan thing. You know, we don&#8217;t want to make one party look good at the expense of another.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, there are sensible members of both parties who are both rejecting President Bush’s rhetoric and strong arm tactics and are looking for sensible reform.  One of them is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7964644">Senator Lindsey Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Hardball’s Chris] MATTHEWS:  Social Security, do you think the president‘s plans for some kind of personal accounts has a better shot now?  <br />GRAHAM:  It has a shot versus no shot.  And watch this group of 14 to come out with some deal for Social Security.  <br />MATTHEWS:  Really?  <br />GRAHAM:  Just keep watching.  <br />MATTHEWS:  So you think this bipartisan approach may have legs?  <br />GRAHAM:  I think this bipartisan approach will be embraced by the American people, will eventually be understood by the conservative and liberal world, and we‘re creating an environment for problem solving.  </p></blockquote>
<p>It’s about time that these folks take back their party.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_22/b3935097_mz057.htm">Howard Gleckman</a> wonders what the details of a bipartisan compromise might look like.  Short version: modest benefit cuts especially for higher income workers as well as more payroll taxes paid by this group plus add-ons but no carve-outs.</p>

The system will allow the Department and the public timely access to preliminary textile and apparel data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (aggregated on a category basis), allowing decision makers to more quickly analyze the impact of imports on the U.S. market. &#8220;This action demonstrates the commitment of this Administration to put in place the tools necessary to enforce our trade agreements and level the playing field to support our domestic textile and apparel industry,&#8221; said Gutierrez. &#8220;We will continue to work with our domestic manufacturers and workers to give them the tools they need to compete internationally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a moment, I’ll try my best shot at providing at least a feeble rational for what I see as a horrific display of politics over principles.  Not that this has not been eloquently said by others, but my own reasons for saying this is a horrific decision run like this: (a) this decision makes certain developing nations a little bit poorer; (b) it indirectly hurts our export sector; (c) it raises the cost of clothing for most Americans including the working poor; (d) any possible tariff revenues will accrue to the Chinese government rather than the U.S. government; and (e) the oldie but goodie – it reduces economic efficiency.  </p>
<p>I can only imagine how a young economic advisor named Paul Krugman might have reacted to the political decisions to restrict trade by President Reagan who like George W. Bush preached free trade but ignored his own CEA’s advice to also practice it.  If I had the thankless task of writing excuses for this horrific decision, I hope I would have done a better job than <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4660294"> Carlos Gutierrez</a> in his recent interview with NPR’s Alex Chadwick.  Gutierrez seems to be saying “what we want is free and fair competition … where companies compete on the basis of their costs”.  Yet the quotas are the antithesis of competition.  Gutierrez went onto to claim that manufacturing employment is on the rise noting that unemployment is down to 5.2%.  </p>
<p>As I read the BLS data, manufacturing employment had fallen to 14.308 million by April 2005 versus 17.181 million as of December 2000.  The decline in the apparel sector was even more dramatic falling from 472.6 thousand (2.75% of manufacturing employment) in December 2000 to 261.9 thousand (1.83% of manufacturing employment) by April 2005.  To be fair to the free trade advocates, the U.S. apparel sector has been steadily declining since at least January 1990 when employment was 926.9 thousand or 5.21% of manufacturing employment.  </p>
<p>So if I had the thankless task of defending these quotas, I might start with how workers in this sector are losing jobs with little prospect of finding gainful employment elsewhere.  Yet, the apologists for this Administration are required to tell us two things that are not true: (1) the overall job market is great; and (2) government policy is committed to retraining displaced workers even though the White House is proposing to reduce such government assistance.  </p>
<p>During Reagan’s first term, one of the excuses for trade protection was the large current account deficits.  The problem with this excuse then is the same problem with this excuse today, which is simply that the current account deficits are a byproduct of the decline in national savings, which is partly due to the fiscal irresponsibility of the White House.  I guess one could argue that Asian Central Bank mercantilism is partly responsible for our current account deficit, but the <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/05/22/business/yourmoney/22every.html">Ben Stein</a> claim that the Chinese Central Bank has a perfectly elastic demand for U.S. government bonds goes further than any economist could go without losing all credibility.</p>

                                <p>The insanity continues.  The San Luis Obispo Tribune <a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/mld/sanluisobispo/business/11698635.htm">reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Interest-only loans financed nearly 70 percent of the home purchases in San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties during the first two months of this year &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The article concludes with quotes from two economists with opposing views of the growing use of IO loans.  First, from <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/rosen.html">Dr. Ken Rosen</a> (California Professor of Real Estate and Urban Economics, Hass Business School, UC Berkeley):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is frightening, frankly.  I&#8217;m worried that more and more people are using (homes) as an investment vehicle and not as a consumption market, and that&#8217;s true of the peak of housing markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  And from California Association of Realtors economist Leslie Appleton-Young:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Given the performance of the housing market over the long-term, instruments that help people get into the housing market are a good thing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Apparently the Federal Reserve, FDIC, Office of the Comptroller and other agencies have decided that it is possible to have too much of &#8220;a good thing&#8221;.  Last Monday, in a highly unusual move, these agencies issued new &#8220;<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2005/20050516/default.htm">Credit Risk Management</a>&#8221; guidelines for the lending industry.  These guidelines are far reaching, but two of the key areas addressed were limitations on the quantity of high LTV (Loan to Value) loans and higher qualifying standards for HELOCs (home equity lines of credit).   These same agencies plan to issue new guidelines for mortgage lenders <i>early next year</i>.</p>
<p>For a glimpse into the Fed&#8217;s thinking, see Dr. Tim Duy&#8217;s &#8220;Fed Watch: <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/fed-watch-fed-and-housing-bubble.html">The Fed and the Housing Bubble</a>&#8221; in his new post today on <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Economist’s View</a>.  Although Dr. Duy mentioned Chairman Greenspan’s remarks regarding housing on Friday, I&#8217;d like to include one here.  With his usual caveats, like &#8220;if there are declines in prices&#8221;, Mr. Greenspan made this comforting remark:<br />
<blockquote><em>&#8220;&#8230; only those who have purchased very recently, purchased just before prices actually literally go down, are going to have problems.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, May 20, 2005</p>

                                <p>&#8230; about their Social Security money.  Via <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type">Brad DeLong</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/05/20/BL2005052000547.html">Daniel Froomkin</a> notes that President Bush is <em>Exploiting a Misconception</em>.  Congressman <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/21/democrats.radio.ap/index.html">Kendrick Meek</a> tells young voters the truth:</p>
<blockquote><p>MIAMI, Florida (AP) &#8212; Rep. Kendrick Meek, D-Florida, appealed to young taxpayers Saturday to oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan to partially privatize Social Security, saying they had to the most to lose from the change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has Meek been reading <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/is-pozen-bush-better-deal-for-younger.html">Mark Thoma</a>?  Alas, <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/national-review-has-dreary-spring.html">Mark</a> endures the writings of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505201652.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hopes were high that little could stop the implementation of a true conservative agenda, one that featured supply-side economic reform, investor-owned Social Security reform, serious budget restraint, large-scale energy deregulation, legal-abuse-curbing tort reform, and the confirmation of pro-business, pro-life judicial nominees.</p></blockquote>
<p>What makes this spring dreary for Lawrence actually makes me glad as Bush wants legislative changes that will undermine Social Security.  As far as confirming rightwing judicial activists, he failed to explain how that would increase economic growth as he failed to explain what he meant supply-side economic reform.  The recent tax cuts have led to less national savings and Kudlow knows that President Bush is not proposing sufficient spending cuts to offset this reduction.  </p>
<p>Finally, Mark’s readers asked about the following odd line from Kudlow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Senate, if you can believe it, just delivered a budget-busting pork-laden $295 billion highway bill, featuring several thousand special-interest earmarks and a phony tax-transfer from general revenues to the trust fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reader suggested that Kudlow was referring to the highway trust fund, but note the differences in what is being proposed as far as spending is small relative to the massive transfer away from the Social Security Trust Fund to give more reductions in taxes on capital income.  If Mr. Kudlow wishes to be honest with the kids – let him simply admit that reducing their future Social Security benefits is the only serious means for paying for today’s reduction in taxes on capital income.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Time for another installment in an irregular series. I thought this email said a lot about the media&#8217;s truly poor job in covering the privatization debate:<br />
<blockquote>In regards to Bush&#8217;s privorization plan for Social Security, I caught the tail end of a speech that a U.S. Senator was giving in Congress. He stated that contrary to the popular perception, the portion of the Social Security that would be diverted into private accounts would be considered a loan from the Social Security Administration which would have to be paid back with a 6 percent interest.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we have a citizen who actually listens to speeches by senators, which probably puts him in the top 10% of the population in terms of being attuned to political goings-on (Certainly, I rarely listen to speeches by senators). And yet if he hadn&#8217;t been listening to speeches by senators, he still would not know about the clawback! How could this happen?</p>
<p>Curious, I searched a few papers for &#8220;bush &#038; social &#038; security &#038; privatization&#8221; First up, the NYT&#8217;s most recent story on the Bush&#8217;s social security plan: <strong></strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Social-Security.html">Bush Committed to Private Accounts Plan</a> &#8212; you guessed it, no mention of the clawback or anything like it.</p>
<p>Next up, the Washington Post, where I learn that, &#8220;washingtonpost.com is undergoing maintenance and some sections of the site are temporarily unavailable.&#8221; That&#8217;s okay. I have a pretty good guess of what I would find, and would not find, were the site working.</p>
<p>Over to the West Coast, where the top hit is noted liberal Michael Kinsley&#8217;s 5/1/05 paean to Bush, &#8220;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-oe-kinsley1may01,1,2445733.column?ctrack=2&#038;cset=true">Bush Gets B+ for Honesty, Even Courage, on Social Security</a>.&#8221; I pretty much knew from the title that there was no description of the clawback, but I read it again anyway, just to make sure. No mention.</p>
<p>Now to the heartland. The Chicago Tribune&#8217;s latest is actually an interesting article, reprinted from The Nation and titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-na-bush20may20,1,3678268.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">How Bush Makes Sure They Agree</a>,&#8221; on how the Bush team screens and selects those who get to attend his taxpayer-funded privatization advocacy trips. Yet still no description of the clawback!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try the WSJ. Their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111653611045238417,00.html?mod=2%5F1132%5F1">latest is an article</a> (behind a paywall) pointing out that even Bob Pozen, author of the plan Bush recently cited as a model for privatization, does not support Bush&#8217;s privatization plan! But no clawback mention or explanation.</p>
<p>Finally, on to that font of knowledge, USA Today. The top hit there is &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-28-bush-conference_x.htm">Bush: Rein in Social Security</a>.&#8221; Yet again, no clawback.</p>
<p>In each instance, I was not simply looking for the word &#8220;clawback.&#8221; Instead, I was looking for either the word &#8220;clawback,&#8221; or some description of the fact that accounts would have to earn at least 3% + inflation, probably more for 70% of workers, before workers would be better off under Bush&#8217;s latest semi-plan (it&#8217;s not really a plan since Bush still has not laid out any real details). Searching to no avail.</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s my very lightly edited  response to my reader:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, that&#8217;s always been the plan &#8212; search, e.g., Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22social+security%22+%2B+%22clawback%22&#038;sourceid=mozilla-search&#038;start=0&#038;start=0&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">&#8220;social security&#8221; + &#8220;clawback&#8221;</a>, with &#8220;clawback&#8221; being the fairly accurate term for the repayment of the loan. Under most plans I&#8217;ve seen, you are basically loaned money at about 3% and have to implicitly pay it back. Your account has to grow at a rate greater than (3% + inflation) before you would be close to better off under Bush&#8217;s apparent plan. I say &#8220;apparent&#8221; because he still has not really detailed a plan.</p></blockquote>
