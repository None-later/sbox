                                <p>A liberal suggestion comes from the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ponnuru/ponnuru200505200751.asp">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>They should, rather, pass the legislation with the confidence that parents of small children are capable of seeing that even if they don&#8217;t pay income taxes now, they very well may pay them later.</p></blockquote>
<p>As soon as Mr. Ponnuru also puts on the table who will pay for all the deferred tax liabilities that are emanating from President Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility, we may have a bipartisan consensus.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let me add a few more provocative thoughts about “globalization” today.  Again, this is partly in response to the public radio series on the subject, which has made me a bit cranky about it.</p>
<p>But first, let me change the terminology somewhat.  In the course that I teach on the subject every year, “globalization” is a term that I assiduously stay away from.  I find the term too vague, diffuse, and laden with different meanings for different people to be of much value.  Instead I prefer the term “economic integration”.  It doesn’t carry all of the meanings that some people attribute to the word “globalization”, and is a term that is much more precise and well-defined to a wider group of people, while still signifying the essence of what worries most people about “globalization”.</p>
<p>Now on to my provocative thoughts of the day.</p>
<p>1) I’m not sure why we care more about economic integration than other types of economic change.  Every time there is a technological innovation, some people benefit but others lose.  Every time a person decides to patronize one store over another, some people benefit but others lose.  Every time any economic transaction happens, in fact, there are winners and losers.  Why does it make a crucial difference whether or not that transaction happened to cross a national border?   All economic transactions, whether domestic or international, involve a willing buyer and a willing seller&#8230; and all therefore (by definition) make the parties directly involve better off.  But all also have negative repercussions on some people not involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Clearly, some would answer, crossing a national border makes a difference because different governments might influence economic decisions differently.  True.  But realistically, most economic integration is not taking advantage of differences in governmental regulations.  The vast majority of international transactions simply take advantage of price differences: the price of labor, the price of capital, etc. </p>
<p>Furthermore, governments interfere in other types of economic change, too.  Governments may do research to encourage technological advances in one particular field, which makes an old industry obsolete and throws people out of work as a result&#8230; but does that mean that we should try to stop technological progress?  Governments may enact policies that privilege one type of industry over others&#8230; but does that mean that we should try to forbid people from changing their spending behavior?  I would argue no.  Economic change happens, and will always happen, and will always create winners and losers.  Why do some types of economic change seem okay to most people while economic integration does not?</p>
<p>2) When thinking about the costs and benefits of economic integration, why should we only consider those that apply to people in our own country?  Is there any particular reason that I should care more about the welfare effects of economic integration on people in Lubbock, Santa Barbara, or Chattanooga than the effects on people in Lucknow, Sao Paolo, or Chongqing?  Personally, I can’t think of any good reason why.  I realize, however, that this is a matter of personal preference; others may indeed genuinely care more about people living in the US than people living in other countries.</p>
<p>However, if one cares equally for people in other countries, then it is hard to think that economic integration is a bad thing.  As I just reiterated, economic change – all types of economic change – generates both winners and losers.  It is reasonable (and, I would argue, virtuous) to care about the losers from any type of economic change, including economic integration.  But one should also be glad for those that have gained.  </p>
<p>I do not rejoice over the bad luck that displaced workers in the US have had to deal with. In fact, I see the horrible consequences of it every day, living in an old, depressed New England mill town that has had an unemployment rate far above the national average for nearly two decades.  And every day I try to effect political and economic changes to help people who are economically disadvantaged through no fault of their own, but rather simply due to the never-ending process of economic change.  </p>
<p>But at the same time I recognize for every one of those mill workers who was laid off in my town, several people around the world were lifted out of abject poverty (and you don’t know what real poverty is until you’ve spent time in a developing country), and for the first time given the chance to feed, clothe, and educate their children so that they can be the first generation with a realistic chance of living a significantly better life than a medieval peasant.</p>
<p>One last word about the field economics in general.  I realize that some of you are disappointed that I agree with the orthodoxy by thinking that international economic integration is generally a good thing, despite the fact that I call myself &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  And I realize that some of you think that economists are all simply brain-washed when it comes to international trade.  But I would like to ask you to give me, and other economists, a little more credit.  We have no incentive to simply follow a “party line”, and we have every incentive to come up with a convincing counter-argument; recognition in the field comes not from repeating orthodoxy but rather from overturning it, after all.  Furthermore, anything that any economist says or writes is immediately subject to vicious and relentless criticism from the rest of the profession – that’s how all academic professions work.    </p>
<p>So if the vast majority of economists agree about something, it’s not because we are simply turning off our brains (and analytical power) on that one subject.  It’s because the theory and evidence on the subject are convincing, and have withstood relentless efforts to debunk it.  In general most economists think economic integration is a good thing, not because it’s convenient to do so, but because the work of thousands of extremely smart people working over decades has convinced us that it usually is.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that economic integration is ever painless, or always good.  But I would also say the same thing about technological progress.  And just as is the case for technological progress, I also think that in general, it&#8217;s more good than bad.</p>

</p>
<blockquote><p>Even as the young Afghan man was dying before them, his American jailers continued to torment him.</p>
<p>The prisoner, a slight, 22-year-old taxi driver known only as Dilawar, was hauled from his cell at the detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan, at around 2 a.m. to answer questions about a rocket attack on an American base. When he arrived in the interrogation room, an interpreter who was present said, his legs were bouncing uncontrollably in the plastic chair and his hands were numb. He had been chained by the wrists to the top of his cell for much of the previous four days.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilawar asked for a drink of water, and one of the two interrogators, Specialist Joshua R. Claus, 21, picked up a large plastic bottle. But first he punched a hole in the bottom, the interpreter said, so as the prisoner fumbled weakly with the cap, the water poured out over his orange prison scrubs. The soldier then grabbed the bottle back and began squirting the water forcefully into Mr. Dilawar&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, drink!&#8221; the interpreter said Specialist Claus had shouted, as the prisoner gagged on the spray. &#8220;Drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the interrogators&#8217; behest, a guard tried to force the young man to his knees. But his legs, which had been pummeled by guards for several days, could no longer bend. An interrogator told Mr. Dilawar that he could see a doctor after they finished with him. When he was finally sent back to his cell, though, the guards were instructed only to chain the prisoner back to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him up,&#8221; one of the guards quoted Specialist Claus as saying.</p>
<p> Several hours passed before an emergency room doctor finally saw Mr. Dilawar. By then he was dead, his body beginning to stiffen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now anything bad that happens in Afghanistan or Iraq over the coming days will be the fault of the New York Times; anything good that happens will be due to the Newsweek <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7857154/site/newsweek/">retraction</a>, and the Bush administration&#8217;s <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/s/ap/newsweek_quran">leveraging thereof</a>.  It&#8217;s perfect.</p>

                                <p>When Senator Frist brought up the nomination of Priscilla Owen, Senator Kennedy asked if this was the same Priscilla Owen that Attorney General Gonzales had accused of judicial activism.  When <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/luskin-is-wrong-personal-accounts-do.html">Mark Thoma</a> critiqued <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200505190928.asp">this NRO op-ed</a> written by Donald Luskin:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, Florida congressman Robert Wexler broke ranks with fellow Democrats by offering a plan to reform Social Security. Amazing! After months of party-line stonewalling, Wexler made a gesture of bipartisanship. And yet there hasn’t been one solitary word about it in the “paper of record,” the New York Times. This is big news. Why the silent treatment from the liberal media? </p></blockquote>
<p>I have to wonder if it is the same Donald Luskin who wrote <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/archives/2005/05/not_exactly_a_p.php">this</a>.</p>
<p>Further down, the NRO Luskin also wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, Social Security is already running a surplus &#8211; it takes in more in taxes each year than it will pay out in benefits (it will do so until 2017).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the person who wrote this line can’t be the same person who claimed the Trust Fund’s crisis date hits around 2011 – right?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It&#8217;s a simple question, but I think that the answer may be less obvious than one might think.  &#8220;Globalization&#8221; doesn&#8217;t simply mean more international trade.  It doesn&#8217;t simply mean traveling more, or having better international internet connections.  It doesn&#8217;t simply mean having more cross-border investment flows.  Rather, it is some amalgam or all of these phenomena, and many more besides.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this question by a CESifo working paper that I just read called &#8220;Metrics Capturing the Degree to Which Individual Economies are Globalized&#8221; (by Riezman, Whalley, and Zhang, April 2005.)  The constant barrage of stories on my NPR station this week about globalization (part of public radio&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.thinkglobal2005.org/">Think Global</a>&#8221; project) has also helped to move this topic to the forefront of my mind right now.</p>
<p>Typical measures of &#8220;globalization&#8221; try to identify the quantity of contacts between a country and the rest of the world.  For a prime example, see the <a href="http://www.atkearney.com/main.taf?p=5,4,1,116">A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Magazine Globalization Index 2005</a>, which explicitly measures political, economic, personal, and technological contacts between countries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CESifo paper comes from a slightly different analytical perspective.  They ask the following question: how far is any particular economy from a state of &#8220;total globalization&#8221;?  By &#8220;total globalization,&#8221; the authors mean a complete absence of transaction barriers with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Asking the question this way makes an important point: the opposite of globalization is <em>national bias</em>.  In an economy that is perfectly globalized, all types of interactions with people in different countries are no more difficult, and no less common, than interactions with people in one&#8217;s own country.  In an economy that is less than perfectly globalized, on the other hand, there is a bias (which among other things could be political, technological, informational, or personal in nature) that encourages a disproportionate amount of interaction with people in one&#8217;s own country.  </p>
<p>This makes for an interesting way to think about the process of globalization.  In a sense, it&#8217;s the process of eliminating national bias.</p>

<p>Yes, I am being deliberately provacative, both with the way I phrased the opening sentence of this post and with the title (which obviously refers to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/what-is-globalization.html">post above this one</a>).

The Cato Institute and Le Club for Rich People have received limited notice from the rightwing blogs for their list of 450 people who support some version of privatization.  While it is true that they list five Noble Prize winners, they also list more names of folks who I would not call “economist”.  And I doubt many of the economists on this list would argue everyone will be better off if Bush’s ideas are implemented.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/fed-watch-steady-as-she-goes-in-more.html">Tim Duy</a> keeps us abreast of the latest on the Federal Reserve including the possibility that Greenspan may stay on for a few more months.  I hope so and I pray no one who takes seriously the musing over at the National Review is ever placed on the Federal Reserve Board.  <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_malpass/malpass200505130836.asp">David Malpass</a> lists a series of assertions and gives his fact-free responses.  Since I predicted the NRO would quickly contradict the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505110857.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>, let’s start with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: Money supply growth has slowed, pointing to a slowdown. <br />Response: I don’t think money growth is well correlated to GDP growth when exchange rates are unstable and money velocity is as variable as it has been since the 1971 departure from the gold standard. Growth of the M2 money supply (currency, checking accounts, and savings accounts) slowed with the pace of mortgage refinancings after the jumps in bond yields in June 2003, April 2004, and March 2005, yet GDP growth didn’t slow. Growth of M0 (basically currency outstanding, since U.S. banks now have very little in assets that are subject to reserve requirements) is slow today because interest rates are rising and the dollar weakened in recent years.<br />Assertion: The yield curve has flattened, pointing to a slowdown. “Shrinking disparity between long and short (Treasury) notes waves caution flag on economy,” went the Wall Street Journal headline of May 9. <br />Response: Longer-term bond yields have stayed low in part due to unusually accommodative and restrained monetary policy. Rather than indicating a slowdown, low long-term bond yields have, at least in 2003 and 2004, preceded a surge in economic growth. I don’t think bond yields, inflation-protected TIPS, or the shape of the yield curve are useful economic indicators when exiting a deflationary period by way of an extraordinary monetary policy. I expect bond yields to rise in 2005 in jumps, as in 2004 and 2003, in response to evidence of economic growth, inflation, and continuing Fed rate hikes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Malpass check with Kudlow on the latest NRO “theory” on the role of money in the economy?  While I disagree with Malpass on the need for monetary restraint, it is because I disagree with him as well as with Kudlow on their assertions that the economy is booming.  If one believes as they do, then one would agree with Malpass’s policy prescription and would disagree with Kudlow.  So why does Malpass believe the economy is booming?  Let’s check out his responses to various assertions of others:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: First-quarter growth was weaker than the reported 3.1 percent because inventories built up, adding to GDP, but subtracting from future GDP. <br />Response: First-quarter GDP will likely be revised up substantially &#8211; perhaps to 3.8 percent. Demand growth remained strong in the first quarter, so even after the inventory build, inventories are at low levels relative to sales, arguing that the inventory build is necessary and helpful to future growth. Inventories built in the first and second quarter of 2004 without causing a slowdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Malpass knows the revision cannot be downward?  Huh? </p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: The labor market still has slack. Said St. Louis Fed president William Poole in a May 11 speech, “Although unit labor costs edged modestly higher over the second half of 2004, growing at a 3% rate, their rate of gain in the first quarter of 2005 slowed to about a 2.25% rate … As the modest first-quarter gains in the employment cost index showed, the threat level is not terribly high … ”<br />Response: The labor market is tighter than widely perceived. Unemployment is 5.2 percent. Unit labor costs rose 4 percent in the third quarter of 2004, the most recent quarter with revised data, after being originally reported up 1.6 percent. Unit labor costs rose 1.7 percent in last year’s fourth quarter and 2.2 percent in this year’s first quarter, a brisk pace that is also subject to possible upward revision when actual compensation data surfaces from state unemployment insurance taxes. </p></blockquote>
<p>All Malpass notes here is his own spin on compensation, which we’ll address in the next A&#038;R.  He fails to note that much of the decline in the unemployment rate is due to a fall in the labor force participation rate with the employment-population ratio still at only 62.6%.</p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: Real wages are falling. <br />Response: Pre-tax nominal wages rose 2.6 percent over the last year while the overall consumer price index (including gasoline) rose 3.1 percent. Real wages fell by this measure. But real wages typically decline well into an expansion and have done at least as well in this expansion as in the strong expansions of 1994 and 1986, especially on an after-tax basis. The wage measure being used to show the worst wage performance is for non-supervisory production workers, a group that is under particular pressure in a globalized economy. A broader inflation measure (the overall PCE deflator for all personal consumption) was up 2.4 percent, so real wages were higher than inflation by this measure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even using the PCE deflator, real wages are near the levels observed at the end of 2001.  While total compensation has risen relative to the overall consumer price index, most of the increase in fringe benefits is simply covering higher health care costs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: Consumption has risen to over 70 percent of GDP, so people are using up their savings.<br />Response: The rise in consumption per GDP is a long-standing trend for the U.S. economy. There are several reasons for this. 1) Investments are increasingly in the form of education and research, which show up in consumption. 2) For tax and other reasons, people seek capital gains rather than ordinary income. The proceeds show up in savings and consumption but not in GDP, distorting the ratios.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Malpass has forgot to read our discussions of how even his favorite measure – household net wealth – shows a decline in real per capita wealth over the past 5 years.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: The deficit is going to sink us. “We are approaching a trillion-dollar trade deficit,” said Sen. Harry Reid in the May 10 New York Times. “We can’t survive as a viable, strong country doing that.”<br />Response: I expect the trade deficit to get bigger and the U.S. economy to remain strong and prosperous. U.S. imports grow with the U.S. economy while exports grow with foreign economies. The U.S. trade deficit is being driven by capital inflows related to the demographic gap between the U.S. and other developed countries. With a growing population, the U.S. needs more capital than other countries do and benefits more from adding it. Conversely, with an older population, foreigners want to buy bonds even at today’s low yields, allowing the U.S. to capture the spread between the cost of foreign capital and the return on investments in the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit will likely grow until Japan and Europe undertake pro-growth structural reforms, developing economies get substantially bigger, or the demographic gap narrows.</p></blockquote>
<p>Malpass suggests we are exporting more but exports have fallen as a share of GDP.  As far as needing more capital because of our allegedly rapid population growth, Malpass ignores several things.  Population is growing in other nations, while there is a debate in this nation about the consequences of all alleged slowdown in population growth in the U.S.  But more importantly, the U.S. savings rate is very low, which is why we are running massive current account deficits.  Maybe Malpass is talking about the late 1990’s when we did save and invest a lot more than we are doing now.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Assertion: Higher interest rates will slow the economy. <br />Response: Real interest rates are very low and haven’t risen much. Interest rates rose in 2004 and didn’t cause a slowdown. I think the Fed’s measured rate hikes have been acting as an accelerant to the economy, maintaining low real interest rates, giving assurance against faster rate hikes, allowing longer-term yields to stay low, and encouraging a “get it while you can” reaction. </p></blockquote>
<p>The low interest rates over the past few years are a product of a weak economy.  If the economy does get back to full employment, the low savings will mean that real interest rates will have to rise.  Then again, I may have not seen the NRO economics paper proving the law of scarcity was repealed.  But where did Malpass get this notion that a higher cost of borrowing will induce less savings and more investment? As far as whether real interest rate rose during 2004, check out what the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/tci10y.txt">Federal Reserve</a> reports.</p>

                                <p>The financial press has been rife with talk about a Chinese revaluation of the yuan over the past week or two.

The piece makes one point in particular that I think has received inadequate attention: a change to the dollar/renmimbi exchange rate will not by itself cause any significant improvement in the US&#8217;s current account deficit.  The US current account deficit will not fall until consumption, either by individuals or the US government, starts to fall relative to income.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/05/the_bush_admini.html">Brad Setser</a> muses about the issue in a typically thoughtful post.  A particularly good question that Brad poses is this:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t understand why the Administration has not worked harder to build the case that China needs to adjust its peg for the sake of the multilateral trading and global monetary system inside the IMF. The US is not the only country with a beef with China: this is an example of an issue where a serious, hard-headed multilateral approach might have better served US interests.</p>
<p>&#8230;[A]part from the Article IV process, there are a range of things the Administration could have asked the IMF to do.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#8217;t the Administration spend more time asking the IMF to do more work on optimum levels of reserve accumulation, to set a benchmark for evaluating China&#8217;s reserve accumulation? Both Goldman Sachs and the World Bank have done some interesting work on this topic. Why hasn&#8217;t the Administration done more to put the responsibilities that go with the right to choose your own exchange rate regime on the global agenda&#8230; [or] demand that the IMF study whether China&#8217;s current levels of intervention go against its IMF commitments?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that the answer to Brad&#8217;s question is that the Bush administration has once again allowed ideology to trump good policy.  I agree with Brad that it would have been more effective to build a multilateral consensus on the China issue, but as we&#8217;ve seen time and time again, the people who actually make policy in the White House (e.g. Cheney and Rove) seem to instinctually want to do everything as unilaterally as possible &#8211; even when it is clearly not in the US&#8217;s best interests to do so.</p>
<p>And now the Bush administration is setting things up for a battle of wills with the Chinese government later this year.  The worst part about it, though, is that I have very little confidence that the Bush administration has thought through what will happen if and when China stops propping up the dollar, or how to respond to events that might follow such a change in the exchange rate.</p>

                                <p>The BLS released the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">April consumer price inflation</a> figures this morning.  Overall inflation faced by consumers was high, unsurprisingly; energy prices alone were up 4.5% in April.  But excluding food and energy costs, the inflation number was surprisingly low.  (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/inflation-measures.html">this post</a> from last month about why it&#8217;s important to consider both the overall and the core inflation rates.)  </p>
<p>The 12-month core inflation rate fell somewhat to 2.24% in April, marking the first fall in that measure since last August.  This could be a one-month blip downward in the core inflation rate, of course, but it could also indicate that the modest pricing power that firms have seemed to enjoy recently (which was a good thing insofar as it indicated robust underlying demand in the economy) is starting to wane.  In a few more months we&#8217;ll know better about which is the case.</p>
<p>At any rate, here&#8217;s the graph of a few inflation measures in the US over the past few years.</p>
