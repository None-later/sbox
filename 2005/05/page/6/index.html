                                <p>When interviewing Mary Matalin, Tim Russert should invite someone other than her husband to stand in for the Democrats.  Nothing against James Carville, but when Mary says things that are <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7761272">simply not true</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS. MATALIN:  There is nowhere in our history, once &#8211; Abe Fortas -who did not have majority &#8211; a legislative filibuster used for the purposes of stopping nominees.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Someone should call her on these things.  If Mr. Fortas did not have a majority in 1968, then why did the Republicans need to filibuster?  </p>
<p>When the topic got around to whether Senator Clinton should be our nominee in 2008, Mary said:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS. MATALIN:  I think she&#8217;s charismatic, she is &#8211; she&#8217;ll have a ton of money. She has a bunch of brilliant people, not the least of which is her husband and his &#8230;(unintelligible).  But no Democrat, Democratic president, has been elected in the last half century that didn&#8217;t have some Southern bona fides</p></blockquote>
<p>So Arkansas is a Northern state and President Kennedy was from the Confederate state of Massachusetts?</p>

                                <p>The Usual Suspects are lining up to push the third plank of the Bush Social Security propaganda.  On one hand, the Usual Suspects tell us that the Pozen plan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/05/AR2005050501680_pf.html">only slows the rate of growth of benefits</a>.  On the other hand, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200505030803.asp">only the wealthy will sacrifice so the poor can have more</a>.  So when <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/opinion/02krugman.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=">Paul Krugman</a> points out that no one gets more benefits and the middle class suffers the largest cuts in terms of percentage of retirement wealth, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/opinion/l07social.html?n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed">Al “not Glenn” Hubbard</a> tells those making around $40,000 a year know that they are affluent and can afford these benefit cuts (and continuing to pay the 12.4% payroll contribution). </p>
<p>These defenses of the Pozen plan strike me as the modern day equivalent of the remarks attributed to Marie Antoinette – “if the people have no bread, then let them eat cake.” This weekend, the New York Times provided us what Kevin Drum calls the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_05/006277.php">The Bobbsey Twins</a>.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/opinion/08brooks.html?">David Brooks</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>By embracing the progressive indexing of Social Security benefits, the president has asked us to make a shared sacrifice for the common good. He&#8217;s asking middle- and upper-class folks to accept benefit cuts so there will be money for the people who are really facing poverty. He has asked us to redistribute money down the income scale. Why should programs for children and families be strangled so Donald Trump can get bigger benefit checks? </p></blockquote>
<p>Having told us that privatization guarantees high stock market returns, which was plank #1 for the propaganda, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/opinion/07tierney.htm">John Tierney</a> dusts off plank #2, which is the system goes broke around 2017.  The political risk that Tierney talks about comes down to whether the GOP will make permanent its various tax cuts on capital income – including the reduction in the top tiers of the income tax, dividend and other capital income tax reductions, and the elimination of the estate tax.  </p>
<p>Tierney’s most recent op-ed, however, exposes this progressivity argument for what it is.  Brooks et al. want to argue there is a shared sacrifice.  I’m not sure whether Mr. Trump even has employment income but certainly his capital income is many multiples of $90,000 a year.  So even including <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/views/articles/20040927galeorszag.htm">deferred taxes</a>, individuals such as Mr. Trump will likely get a significant overall tax break paid for by middle class workers – either in the form of future new taxes or continuing to contribute 12.4% of the wages to a Social Security system that will pay out less.  </p>
<p>Brooks et al. also want to argue that Bush is being principled and brave.  Yet, Bush-Cheney ’04 denied that they were planning to cut benefits during the President campaign – and when presented with the facts, Andrew Card tried to disown the Pozen plan.  The cynicism, dishonesty, and hypocrisy of these Bush minions aside, the middle class likely knows that Bush’s Social Security proposals are part of a massive shift of the tax burden onto them.  Now if these minions wish to say working class Americans are affluent enough to make sacrifices so Donald Trump can keep his tax cuts, maybe we Democrats should highlight their own words.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">Paul Krugman</a> was on the story before I was – again.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: How dare I leave <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200505100918.asp">Donald Luskin</a> off my list? He is rather desperate to accuse Krugman of a lie:</p>
<blockquote><p>Krugman flat-out lied when he wrote that “benefits for the poor would be maintained, not increased” in the president’s proposal. It’s true that under progressive indexing benefits for the lowest-wage earners would stay the same as under current law … Krugman also lied when he portrayed progressive indexing as “a plan to slash middle-class benefits.” It’s not a plan to “slash” benefits at all, or even reduce them. Under progressive indexing, everyone’s Social Security benefits will be greater than they are today, by the rate of inflation or more. What progressive indexing does is slow the runaway growth in benefits</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is a lot more to Luskin’s latest rant – but he has failed to rebut anything Krugman wrote – although he does display his own stupidity and/or mendacity as usual.</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forbes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2005/05/09/afx2012041.html">reported</a> today that UK housing prices are up &#8221; 0.31 pct from the previous quarter&#8221;.  That is a slight decline in real terms.  However the &#8220;volume of sales decreased by 34.77 pct&#8221;.  That is exactly how a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">housing bust</a> usually works:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Housing &#8220;bubbles&#8221; typically do not &#8220;pop”, rather prices tend to deflate slowly in real terms, over several years. Historically real estate prices display strong persistence and are sticky downward. Sellers want a price close to recent sales in their neighborhood, and buyers, sensing prices are declining, will wait for even lower prices. This means real estate markets do not clear immediately, and what we usually observe is a drop in transaction volumes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>   It is the drop in transaction volumes that causes general economic problems (slower retail sales, lower employment, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong> &#8220;Are we there yet?&#8221; Soon.</p>
<p>Next year at this time I expect to be writing about how the falloff in housing is impacting the economy, but I wouldn’t be completely surprised if the housing bubble is still expanding. Speculative bubbles go on longer than most people can imagine.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Predicting the timing of a future economic event is not easy. Predicting what will happen is easier, though.&#8221;<br />Warren Buffet, 4/30/2005</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we can look at the UK for guidance on timing. But first, here is another amazing story in the Washington Post from this morning, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/07/AR2005050700198.html">It&#8217;s on the House</a>: Now Everybody Is Paying for Everything With Home Equity”. Also see Dr. Setser’s take: “<a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/05/the_us_economy.html">The US economy, in a nutshell?</a>&#8221; as Setser ties the housing boom to the current account deficit &#8211; an ongoing theme.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in the UK?</strong> The housing boom has apparently ended, and the retailers are already feeling the impact. According to the Telegraph this morning: &#8220;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/05/08/ccboom08.xml&#038;menuId=242&#038;sSheet=/money/2005/05/08/ixcoms.html">It&#8217;s bad and getting worse</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The longest and strongest consumer boom in recent history is over. And normally euphoric retailers are suddenly feeling very depressed &#8230;</p>
<p>The storm clouds hanging over the UK retail sector are looking greyer by the day. New figures from the British Retail Consortium, the industry body, will tomorrow show that high street sales over April fell by more than 3 per cent compared to the previous year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is on top of last week&#8217;s bleak numbers for retail and manufacturing, &#8220;<a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8209-1596982,00.html">UK Economy Shaken</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;High street sales suffered their steepest monthly drop for 13 years while manufacturing activity succumbed to its first decline in two years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Friday morning the BBC reported that &#8220;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4514207.stm">Britain braced for credit crunch</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Not since the mid-1990s, as the last economic recession claimed its final victims, has so much debt pain been felt by so many people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…according to official figures nearly 26,000 property repossession orders were granted in the first three months of 2005, the highest number since 1995.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And sure enough, on Friday the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/story.jsp?story=636322">revealed</a> that &#8220;Personal bankruptcies leap 25 per cent to hit an all-time high&#8221;.<br />According to Steve Treharne, the head of personal insolvency at the accountants KPMG:<br />
<blockquote>“There is a big black cloud of debt hanging over the UK.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So for housing, is the UK leading the US?</strong> Here is a comparison of the monetary policy of the respective Central Banks. The <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/Links/setframe.html">Bank of England</a> started raising rates in November of 2003.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USUK.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USUK.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">Federal Reserve</a> didn&#8217;t start raising rates until June, 2004. It appears the US is about 6 to 8 months behind the UK. Although both the US and UK rates were at 6% in Jan 2001, the Federal Reserve lowered US rates far lower than the UK and held rates lower for an extended period.  Still it is possible that housing in the US will not suffer until the Fed Fund rate is over 4% or higher &#8211; some time in the future.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll finish with another Buffett <a href="http://www.usafairtrade.com/icplan.htm">quote</a> (on the trade imbalance):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I will close by reminding you again that I cried wolf once before. In general, the batting average of doomsayers in the U.S. is terrible. Our country has consistently made fools of those who were skeptical about either our economic potential or our resiliency. Many pessimistic seers simply underestimated the dynamism that has allowed us to overcome problems that once seemed ominous. We still have a truly remarkable country and economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2118053/">Jacob Weisberg</a> has an interesting discussion of how the GOP has failed to live up to its 1995 promise to downsize the Federal government.  He points to a <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa543.pdf">Cato paper</a> documenting that inflation-adjusted spending for the 101 largest programs that the Republicans proposed to eliminate as unnecessary in 1995 has risen by 27%.  Cato should be congratulated on two counts: (1) one for noting that the GOP is not really “giving us our money back”, and (2) using real increases as opposed to nominal increases to make this particular point.  Alas, the Executive Summary starts off with the statement that total government spending increased by 33% during Bush&#8217;s first term, which has to reflect the nominal increase in spending.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Stephen Moore will join The Wall Street Journal as its senior economics writer.  While <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_05/006249.php">Kevin Drum</a> calls this a move to lower their collective intelligence, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001359.html">Max Sawicky</a> suggests this move may actually increase the already low standards of the editorial page of what otherwise is a very good newspaper.  Since the problem with the editorial page has been not stupidity but rather mendacity, let me suggest that Moore can radically change this perception by pointing out the flaws in the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505051554.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a>.  Kudlow wants you to believe that the Bush tax cuts have increased revenues by causing a supply-side boom to the economy even though he knows that the 2.5% average annual growth in real GDP over the past four years is below that 3.5% normal growth he keeps referring to.  For Moore’s convenience, I have graphed real Federal tax revenues excluding payroll contributions (see <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">NIPA table 3.2, line 2</a>) (which includes personal current taxes, corporate income taxes, taxes on production and imports, and taxes from rest of the world) – using the GDP deflator to convert nominal to real.  Tax collections were $1313.6 billion in 2000 but had fallen to $1023.1 billion in real terms by 2004.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/tax.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, it might be difficult for Art Laffer’s co-author of the October 27, 2000 WSJ op-ed endorsement of George W. Bush to adopt my suggestion since Moore and Laffer tried to tell the WSJ readers that the Reagan tax cuts led to faster long-term growth and a doubling of tax revenues.  As noted by <a href="http://www.tnr.com/archive/06/063097/chait063097.html">Jonathan Chait</a>, Moore also suggested that the Clinton era was one of slow growth and weaker tax revenue growth than the Reagan era.  Moore will be happy to note the real tax revenue series we present here does not include payroll taxes given how Chait noted that much of the 1980’s increase in tax revenues was due to the Social Security reforms in 1983.  Moore and Laffer also pulled a bait-and-switch on the eve of the Bush-Gore election by citing real tax revenue growth for the 1920’s but subtly moving over to nominal tax revenue growth when discussing the Reagan-Bush41 era.  Again, our series consistently looks at real tax revenues not including payroll contributions.  </p>
<p>Of course, Moore would have to admit that real tax revenues were only 16.1% higher in 1992 versus 1980 – in part because real GDP growth averaged only 3.0% per year over this 12-year period.  Over the next eight years, real GDP growth averaged 3.7% per year and real tax revenues were 71.9% higher in 2000 than they were in 1992.  </p>
<p>Now I’m not asking Mr. Moore to give up on his small government philosophy.  Low tax rates don’t cause slower long-term growth but low national savings does tend to crowd-out investment.  As Bruce Bartlett often notes, the failure to reduce government spending to pay for the Reagan tax cuts was a serious problem for their “save and invest” agenda.  I suspect most readers of the Wall Street Journal are already smart enough to reject the free-lunch version of supply-side economics.  I also imagine that they would appreciate a renewed integrity if the editorial pages simply admitted as much.  </p>
<p>Final note: <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2005/05/06/tax-politics">Henry Farrell</a> has a must see post on the politics of taxation with a wonderful caption of Homer Simpson as Karl Rove’s favorite voter.</p>

                                <p>An interesting question in the air this week is this: to what degree is the US economy shifting resources out of other sectors of the economy and into construction projects?  The graph below gives my best answer to this question, which is that the shift into construction is real, and substantial.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/construction1.jpg">
<div>(Note that the two series are not exactly comparable, since the employment line shows all construction employment, while the GDP line shows only residential construction as a percent of GDP.)</div>
<p>Clearly the house-building industry is highly cyclical.  In part it depends on interest rates &#8211; the sharp drops in construction activity around 1980-82 and around 1990-92 both coincided with interest rate increases.  And at the other end of the spectrum, today&#8217;s boom in real estate (including new home construction) is widely attributed to extremely low interest rates.  </p>
<p>But just as clearly, interest rates do not explain all of the movements of resources into and out of construction. The following chart shows the Prime Lending Rate and 10-yr Treasury yield in both nominal and real terms over the same time period as the preceding chart. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/real_irates2.jpg">
<div>(Note: the real rate is calculated by subtracting the average inflation rate of the GDP deflator over the previous 24 months from the nominal rate, a technique that I&#8217;ve <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/excessive-liquidity.html">previously noted</a> seems to provide a good proxy for inflation expectations.)</div>
<p>The relatively low interest rates of 1992-94 did not spark a major housing boom, and the relatively high interest rates of the mid 1980s did not quash a significant burst of construction activity.  So while they certainly help, low interest rates seem to be neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for shifting economic resources into the construction sector of the economy.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m left somewhat unconvinced that the low interest rates of the past couple of years are single-handedly responsible for the significant rise in construction activity in the US in recent years.  I think there&#8217;s something else going on.  Perhaps its just psychology: good old &#8216;animal spirits&#8217;.  If so, then perhaps higher interest rates (when they finally do arrive) may cause construction activity to fall not so much because of their direct effect, but more because of how they may contribute to a shift in the psychology of builders.  I suppose you could call this a &#8216;sunspot&#8217; theory of construction activity&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Kash noted today’s good news on employment growth and provided a graph of the employment-population (EP) ratio, which increased from 62.4% to 62.6%.  While this is the first time since October 2002 that this ratio has exceeded 62.5%, the unemployment rate did not fall.  The following graph shows why I have argued that the unemployment rate can be a misleading indicator of labor market conditions.  Simply put – the rise in the civilian labor force participation rate (LF) last month masked the goods news as far as new employment.  The unemployment rate can be seen as one minus EP divided by LF.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/erate.jpg"></p>
<p>Our graph shows how LF and EP have evolved since January 2000.  During the 2001 recession and very weak partial recovery of 2002 and early 2003, the increase in the unemployment rate was less dramatic than the decline in EP as LF eroded.  Some of the subsequent reduction in the unemployment rate is attributable to a rise in EP but some of it had been attributable to a continued erosion of LF.  Now some Administration apologists (and not just <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200501071537.asp">this fellow</a>) have tried to argue that the decline in labor force participation was voluntary, but many economists would argue much of the decline represented a discouraged worker effect.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, we saw some improvement in the labor market this month, which showed up in higher EP and LF ratios.  I’m on record for praying for a return to the days of having employment being 64% of the adult population.  Let’s suppose some forecaster tells us his macroeconomic model predicts a 4.5% unemployment rate by the end of 2006.  I’m sure some Administration apologists will go giddy with glee, but I’m going to look at the details as to what the forecaster is saying about the labor force participation rate.  If the forecast is for LF = 67% so EP = 64%, I’ll join in the glee.  But if the forecast is for LF = 66% so EP = 63%, I’ll continue to argue we should hold to higher standards before we declare full employment.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/06/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm">CNN</a> paints a rosy picture of the jobs market by noting two things.  One item relates to the increase in <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/AWHNONAG/11/10yrs">average hourly work week</a> even though 33.9 hours is still far below the level observed in 2000.  The other alleged improvement relates to wages even if CNN’s reported increase in average weekly wages is mostly from the first statistic as nominal wages rose by only 0.3%.  <em>Memo to self</em>: stop being so hard on the National Review as at least they are not responsible for those CNN/Money stories.</p>

                                <p>The BLS&#8217;s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">employment report for April</a> is pretty good:<br />
<blockquote>Employment rose in April, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 274,000 over the month. Job growth was widespread, with gains in construction, mining, and several service-providing industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve now seen positive net job creation for almost two years, with sporadic months (like this month) that have yielded enough job growth to actually start slowly increasing the employment-population ratio:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empl_apr05.jpg"></p>
<p>This month&#8217;s report is encouraging&#8230; though as always, I will add the caveat here that it takes a few months (of monthly data) to really differentiate a trend from a temporary blip in the data.  As the graph above makes clear, we also have quite a way to go to match the labor market performance of the mid 1990s (to say nothing of the booming late 1990s). </p>
<p>One last note: one of the bright spots in the labor market continues to be construction.  Of the roughly 3 million net jobs created since early 2003, half a million have been in the construction industry.  As a result, the percent of American workers employed by the construction industry has been rising in recent years:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/constr_employment.jpg"></p>
<p>This is good in some ways (half a million more jobs is of course better than their absence), but bad in others.  Construction jobs are by nature quite temporary, and employment in construction can therefore fall as quickly as it can rise.  Something to look out for, if and when long-term interest rates start to go up&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Leave it to <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.com/">Donald Luskin </a> to extract just one comment from the Washington Post’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/05/03/DI2005050300624.html">Steven Pearlstein</a> interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fairfax, VA: Do you agree with Paul Krugman&#8217;s assertion that the President&#8217;s recent plan to cut social security benefits actually falls mostly on the middle class and not the wealthiest?<br />Steven Pearlstein: No, it was very intellectually dishonest. All he was really saying is that, for rich people, Social Security benefits are a small part of their post retirement income. In truth, any cut in benefit will fall mostly on the middle class because the middle class gets most of the benefits. Its sophistry, really.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect neither the caller nor Pearlstein carefully read Paul Krugman’s op-ed, which was very careful in defining the metric to be estimated percentage of total retirement benefits lost.  And I guess Mr. Pearlstein does not understand that a middle class worker gets more benefits than a low income worker because he pays more into the system.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_kucewicz/kucewicz200505040844.asp">William Kucewicz</a> tries to argue over at NRO that “China’s dollar-pegged exchange rate has been one of the bright spots of the international monetary system of the past decade”.  His primary argument seems to be that a fixed exchange rate system is both a necessary and sufficient condition for price stability.  The evidence he presents for this proposition, however, is less than convincing.  </p>
<p>Kucewicz also points to <a href="http://nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504191337.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>A much slower China economy would take a percentage point or two off U.S. economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow is not clear where he got the estimated magnitude from, but it strikes me that he may have gotten the direction incorrect.  Kudlow’s argument implicitly assumes a downward expenditure adjustment as far as Chinese aggregate demand whereas a revaluation of the Chinese currency is more likely to cause expenditure-switching away from Chinese production and towards production in other nations such as the U.S.</p>
<p>Update:  While Kucewicz claims to have graphed China’s consumer price inflation against the nominal exchange rate, as I consult the International Financial Statistics (IFS) series 64 (consumer prices), I do not see the same alleged deflation for the late 1980’s or late 1990’s.  Beyond that, I’m not sure what a comparison of the level of the yuan/$ nominal exchange rate against the rate of increase of one of the nation’s price-level is supposed to demonstrate.  As an alternative, the following graph compares the ratio of China’s GDP deflator to the U.S. GDP deflator to the exchange rate (both indexed so that the 1990-level is unity) from 1978 to 2000 (the years that are covered by the IFS).  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/yuan.jpg"></p>
<p>In the early part of this period, U.S. inflation exceeded Chinese inflation.  However, the yuan devalued in nominal terms, which implies a rather dramatic real devaluation of the Chinese currency.  For the period from 1985 to 1995, Chinese inflation exceeded U.S. inflation with the nominal devaluation of the yuan exceeding this inflation differential, which implies a continued real devaluation of the Chinese currency.  Kucewicz focuses on the period since 1995, which is a period where Chinese inflation has indeed been so low that with a pegged exchange rate – the real devaluation of the Chinese currency has continued.  And yet, the National Review argues against a nominal appreciation of the yuan based on a Global Monetarist mentality that does not fit the data very well.</p>
